<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>A Line in the Sand: The Alamo in Blood and Memory</h2><p>In late February and early March of 1836, a Mexican army led by General Antonio L�pez de Santa Anna lay siege to a mission known as the Alamo, held by a small band of rebels that included Davy Crockett, James Bowie, and William Travis. In the dark early morning of March 6, all inside the fort were dead -- and one of America's most enduring legends was born. <br> Randy Roberts and James S. Olson retell the story of the Alamo from both the Mexican and the American perspectives, delving into the historical accuracy of such myths as Bowie's famous line in the sand, Crockett's celebrated fight to the death, and the common portrayal of the Mexicans as ruthless killers. Separating fact from fiction, they trace how and why those fictions grew, from the rapid spread of the rallying cry "Remember the Alamo!" to the "patriotic" depictions of battle in American films and television to the potency of the Alamo as a symbol in Texas politics and American culture today.</p><p><b>Randy Roberts</b> is professor of history at Purdue University and lives in Lafayette, Indiana.<b>Chapter 5: "VICTORY or DEATH"</b> <p>Perhaps Travis and a few others had some vague sense that something was different when they were awoken early on February 23 by the sound of horses and wagons and Spanish voices drifting down the streets of the town and heading toward the open country to the north and east. Tejano B�xar was on the move in much greater volume than before, and the creaking carts, lowing oxen, and neighing horses made it hard to miss. Those with carts had them packed full; those on foot carried supplies on their shoulders. Although Travis had other concerns to occupy his attention, he was troubled by the rapid and unexpected exodus. He had his soldiers detain a few peripatetic stragglers for questioning.</p> <p>He asked some where they were going, and they answered evasively, talking about the need to begin spring planting. Unsatisfied, Travis had a few arrested, but that tactic also failed to loosen their tongues. Finally, Nathaniel Lewis, a local merchant, told Travis what every Tejano seemed to know: a Mexican army had been sighted at Le�n Creek, less than eight miles southwest of B�xar. They were coming, and the Tejanos had been warned. Exactly how and by whom was uncertain. Jos� Mar�a Rodr�guez, a child in 1836, long afterward recalled that early in the morning of February 23 a man named "Rivas called at our home and told us that he had seen Santa Anna in disguise the night before looking in on a <i>fandango</i> on Soledad Street." Rodr�guez's father was away "with General Houston's army," but his mother made the decision to bury their money in the clay floor of their home, pack their goods into oxcarts, and go to the ranch of Do�a Santos Xim�nes.</p> <p>Rodr�guez's memories, though seventy-five years after the event, probably faithfully captured the mood of B�xar that morning. Rumors of Santa Anna sighting, always inaccurate, mixed with reports of the size of the army, always exaggerated. Added together they equaled fear. Any unrecognized man in a poncho and a broad-brimmed hat might be Santa Anna, and an army of ten thousand, fifteen thousand, twenty thousand, or more was on the outskirts of town. Remember what happened in Zacatecas the year before, or after the 1813 insurrection in B�xar itself. If the army was coming, local wisdom dictated that every resident of B�xar should scurry out of harm's way.</p> <p>At first Travis was unconvinced, but after a few more reports he took precautions. Accompanied by John Sutherland and a few other men, Travis climbed to the belfry of the San Fernando Church between the Main Plaza and the Military Plaza and squinted toward the southwest. Nothing. But to be on the safe side he posted a reliable man as a sentinel with orders to ring the bell if he spied the enemy. Hours passed. Travis looked after other affairs. Then in the early afternoon the bell clanged wildly. Once again Travis scaled to the top of the square tower, glared out into the sun, and saw nothing save a wide prairie broken by patches of mesquite and thickets of chaparral. But the sentinel insisted that he had seen Mexican soldiers out there in the direction of the sun. They had simply disappeared in the bushwood.</p> <p>Sutherland wanted to ride out and take a look, and Travis agreed that he should take John W. Smith, a local carpenter who knew the country, and reconnoiter the area along the Laredo Road. Sutherland told Travis if "he saw us returning in any other gait than a slow pace, he might be sure that we had seen the enemy."</p> <p>If Sutherland and Smith took the Laredo Road, they rode directly south. At the same moment, the vanguard of Santa Anna's army was approaching B�xar from the southwest. The night before, the Vanguard Brigade under General Joaqu�n Ram�rez y Sesma had camped along the Alazon Creek, above which a ridgeline afforded the view of the entire San Antonio River Valley. There he could only watch the heavy rains foil hopes of taking the town unprepared. Santa Anna would later write that had the surprise attack taken place it "would have saved the time consumed and the blood shed later in taking of the Alamo."</p> <p>Crossing over the crest of the slope, Sutherland and Smith got a good look at what the sentinel had seen only at a distance. There must have been fifteen hundred soldiers, Sutherland later remembered, "their polished armor glistening in the rays of the sun, as they formed in a line between the <i>chaparral</i> and the mesquite bushes." In 1836 Mexican soldiers were not wearing breastplates, so no armor glistened in the sun, but Sutherland did not spend much time looking. He and Smith wheeled their horses and spurred north. In a moment, however, Sutherland was on the ground. His horse had slipped in the mud, thrown him, and rolled on top of his leg. Smith helped his dazed companion back onto the saddle and they rode hard into B�xar.</p> <p>The confirmation that the Mexicans were coming in force sent another wave of panic through the town. Travis ordered his men to cross the San Antonio River and take cover in the Alamo. Herding cattle before them and raiding <i>jacales</i> -- poor people's shacks -- along the way for corn and supplies, they moved in an orderly fashion toward the old mission. Juan Segu�n, one of the Tejano revolutionary leaders, recalled that as the Texans walked east on Potero Street toward the river, women stood by watching and exclaiming, "Poor fellows you will all be killed, what shall we do?"</p> <p>Travis was wondering the same thing. He had a force of about 150 men, a loose collection of volunteers and regular army, under the joint command of himself and Bowie. In his group were colonels, captains, lieutenants, and sergeants -- designations that were hardly based on any sort of education or training. In truth, he had a body of men, a group of patriots and adventurers, among whom were some natural leaders like David Crockett, James Bowie, Juan Segu�n, William C. M. Baker, and William Blazeby, but none were experienced officers.</p> <p>Even more than officers, Travis needed men, and he needed them fast. Seeing that Sutherland was too injured from his fall to be of much use, at 3 P.M. Travis penned a hasty note to Andrew Ponton in Gonzales and sent him off with it. "The enemy in large force is in sight," he wrote. "We need men and provisions. Send them to us. We have 150 men and are determined to defend the Alamo to the last. Give us assistance." Later he wrote a similar note to James Fannin in Goliad, promising to "make such a resistance as is due to our honour, and that of the country, until we can get assistance from you, which we expect you to forward immediately." It was an urgent message, more an order than a request. Travis, determined "never to retreat," deemed "it unnecessary to repeat to a brave officer, who knows his duty" that he needed help, but he wrote it nonetheless.</p> <p>While the Texans occupied the Alamo, Santa Anna's Vanguard Brigade marched into B�xar. "I will never forget how that army looked as it swept into town," Juan D�az recalled. "At the head of the soldiers came the regimental band, playing the liveliest airs, and with the band came a squad of men bearing the flags and banners of Mexico and an immense image that looked like an alligator's head." Thousands of Mexican soldiers had moved into B�xar that afternoon, and what they saw confirmed the rebellious nature of the Texans. Above the Military Plaza, and then the Alamo, flapped a tricolor flag with two stars. The stars represented Coahuila and Texas, and the flag signified that the Texans were in rebellion against Santa Anna's violations of the Mexican constitution. Answering flag with flag, Santa Anna ordered a blood red flag raised on the bell tower of the San Fernando Church, a mere thousand yards from the Alamo. In the center of the flag were the skull and crossbones. The flag meant no quarter, no surrender, no mercy -- death for every man who opposed the Mexican government. The Texas rebels, Santa Anna believed, were filibusterers, pirates, and traitors, not soldiers of an established nation, and would be treated accordingly.</p> <p>The Texans inside the Alamo responded to the flag with a blast from their eighteen-pounder. If Santa Anna wanted a battle without quarter, then so be it. The Texans were ready, just as they had been a few months before when Cos occupied the Alamo. The ball landed harmlessly in the town, raising dust and hurting no one, but the action was an eloquent note of defiance. Santa Anna answered fire with fire. Two Mexican howitzers rained four grenades toward the Alamo. Several shells exploded inside the fort but did no real damage. From inside the Alamo a new flag stretched above the west wall. A white flag. The Texans wanted to talk. Santa Anna responded by ordering a parley sounded.</p> <p>Talk, yes -- but about what? Both Texans and Mexicans were confused about the exact order of the opening sequence of events. Did the Texans fire first, or did the Mexicans? Was the red flag misinterpreted? Had Santa Anna sounded a parley during engagements, or even before the first shot? Someone inside the Alamo told Bowie that he distinctly heard the notes of a parley, and Bowie ripped a page out of a child's copybook and scribbled a hurried message to Santa Anna asking for clarification. "I wish, Sir, to ascertain if it be true that a parlay was called, for which reason I send my second aid, [Green B.] Benito Jameson, under guarantee of a white flag which I believe will be respected by you and your forces." "Dios y Mexico," he ended his note, but after second thoughts he crossed it out and penned, "God and Texas!" Though ill and in a ticklish military situation, he still wanted Santa Anna to know that he was not a man to bend. "God and Texas" said it nicely.</p> <p>Santa Anna was above answering a rebel. He refused to meet -- let alone negotiate with -- Jameson. Instead, he instructed aide-de-camp Colonel Jos� Batres to answer Bowie. "I reply to you, according to the order of his Excellency, that the Mexican army cannot come to terms under any conditions with rebellious foreigners to whom there is n...</p></p><h2>Called to Be Amish: My Journey from Head Majorette to the Old Order (Plainspoken)</h2><p>Fewer than one hundred people have joined the Old Order Amish and stayed since 1950.

He knows the drill, Em figures, so he won't get the wrong idea.&nbsp;<br><br>What Jack needs is an excuse to leave town. Ever since rescuing four teenagers from a car wreck, he's been hailed as a hero and the attention is making him itchy, especially since his too-pretty ex-wife is back, angling for a reunion. He's always liked Emmaline. She needs a weekend date? No problem.&nbsp;<br><br>So when they wind up in bed together, Em chalks it up to red wine and chocolate cake, just one impulsive night not to be repeated. But Jack's pushing for more, and if she lets down her guard, either she'll get her heart crushed again, or discover that Jack's worth more than just dreaming about.</p><p>Kristan Higgins is the New York Times, Publishers Weekly and USA TODAY bestselling author whose books have been translated into more than twenty languages. She has received dozens of awards and accolades, including starred reviews from Publishers Weekly, Library Journal, The New York Journal of Books and Kirkus.&nbsp;<br><br>Kristan lives in Connecticut with her heroic firefighter husband, two atypically affectionate children, a neurotic rescue mutt and an occasionally friendly cat.&nbsp;Nothing kicked off Emmaline Neal's weekend like using a Taser.<br><br>Okay, okay, she hadn't used the Taser yet and she probably wouldn't get to <em>(dang),</em> but the tiny thrill of anticipation didn't lie. If indeed there was an intruder in the Mcintosh house, it would be deeply satisfying to apprehend him. Barb Mcintosh suspected a sex offender, and, if she was right, Em knew exactly where she'd target the electrodes.<br><br>Granted, Barb had already admitted to being addicted to <em>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</em> ("That Christopher Meloni! So handsome!"). But she'd heard strange noises in the utility part of her basement, and her grandson, the notoriously creepy Bobby, wasn't home.<br><br>"Approaching cellar stairs," Everett Field whispered.<br><br>"Yeah, I can tell that, Ev, since I'm right behind you," Emmaline said. "And there's no need to whisper."<br><br>"Roger that," Everett whispered.<br><br>Despite the fact that Emmaline had only been on the job for nine months and Everett was more senior, they both knew she was a better cop. Ev wasn't the crunchi-est chip in the bag.<br><br>"You sure Bobby's not here?" Em asked Barb over her shoulder.<br><br>"No. I called him on the phone and yelled down there, so..."<br><br>"Roger that," Everett said, reaching for his holster. "Alert for incoming hostiles."<br><br>"Get your hand off that gun, Everett," Emmaline said. "And where do you get this language?"<br><br>"Call of Duty."<br><br>"Great. Just calm down. We're not shooting anyone." Taser at most, and only then if there was a struggle.<br><br>The crime rate was pretty low in Manningsport, New York, population 715, a tiny town at the base of Keuka Lake. Everett and Em made up two-thirds of the police department; their boss, Levi Cooper, was the other third. Traffic patrol, the occasional DUI, vandalism, parking tickets... That was about as exciting as it got around here. Em ran a group for at-risk teenagers, of whom there were four. In the summer and fall, when the tourists came to taste wine and swim and boat on Keuka Lake, they were busier, but this was January, and things were quiet. In fact, this was their first call in three days.<br><br>Something thumped, and Everett squeaked. Chances were that it was a malfunctioning furnace. Possibly a raccoon. Levi always said if you heard hoofbeats, expect to see horses, not zebras.<br><br>They were in the cellar now; in front of them was Bobby's apartment; to the right was the door to the other half of the cellar, which housed the furnace and water heater and, Barb had told them, several dozen jars of pickled vegetables she'd put up this summer.<br><br><em>Thud.</em><br><br>Okay, something was in there.<br><br>"It's probably an animal," Em murmured, taking the Maglite off her belt. The utility room wasn't accessible from the outside, so a person would've had to come in through the house. And Barb always locked up (again, the mighty influence of <em>Law &amp; Order).</em><br><br>Everett put his hand on the doorknob and looked at Em, who nodded. Then he flung open the door, and Em flashed the light, and something moved inside, and Everett screamed and, before she could stop him, drew and fired.<br><br><em>Damn!</em> The noise slapped her eardrums hard.<br><br>"It's a cat! Everett, it's a cat!" she yelled. "Holster your weapon!"<br><br>Everett obeyed. As he did, a ball of black and white leaped on him, hissing, and sank its teeth into his thigh. Apparently Puss in Boots didn't appreciate being shot at.<br><br>"Officer down, officer down!" Ev yelled, swatting at it. "Ten double zero, officer down!"<br><br>"Shut up," Em ordered. "You deserve it." He'd missed the kitty, of course. The guy was a terrible shot.<br><br>She lifted the cat gently by the scruff of the neck and pulled it off Everett's leg. All of a sudden, Everett was grabbed around the throat by Bobby McIntosh, who apparently <em>was</em> home after all.<br><br>"Why did you shoot my cat?" he yelled.<br><br>"Bobby! Let go of him!" Emmaline said.<br><br>"We don't have a cat!" Barb said from upstairs. "Bobby, did you bring a cat home?"<br><br>Everett was sputtering and red-faced. Em sighed. "Let him go, or I'll have to use this," she said, taking her Taser off her belt. "It hurts."<br><br>He hesitated. She cocked an eyebrow, and, with a sigh, he released her partner.<br><br><em>Drat.</em> "Thank you, Bobby," she said. <em>So close.</em><br><br>"Bobby! What were you doing down there?" Barb said. "I called you and you didn't answer! Where did you get that thing, anyway? I hate cats."<br><br>"I love them," Bobby said. "I got it from the shelter."<br><br>"Okay, so we're good here," Emmaline said. Everett's eyes were wide. "Come on, Ev&#x2014;let's go. You're gonna have to file a report for discharging your firearm, you know."<br><br>"I thought it was a sex offender," Everett said, his hands shaking.<br><br>"It wasn't. You're safe now, buddy," she said, patting his arm. "Come on. Back to the station."<br><br>"You shot a cat?" Chief Cooper said fifteen minutes later, staring at Everett.<br><br>"I'm sorry." Ev stood there like a chastened kid.<br><br>"He missed," Emmaline said. Now that the ringing in her ears had faded, it was hard not to laugh. "The suspect was quite fast." Levi gave her a look.<br><br>"File the report, Everett. The incident is under review, which means you just increased my workload."<br><br>"Sorry, Chief. Um, Bobby McIntosh attacked me."<br><br>"Because you shot at his pet."<br><br>"In self-defense."<br><br>"Not really," Emmaline said. "The cat was the one acting in self-defense."<br><br>Levi bit down on a grin. "Your mother won't be happy about this, Ev."<br><br>"Do you have to tell her?"<br><br>"She's the mayor. So, yes."<br><br>"Shit." Everett heaved a sigh. "Anything else, Chief?"<br><br>"No. Fill out the report and get out of here."<br><br>Everett left the office and swiped a cookie from the desk of Carol Robinson, their newly hired administrative assistant, who'd been shamelessly eavesdropping.<br><br>"Thanks for not letting Bobby kill Everett," Levi said to Emmaline.<br><br>"I was kind of hoping to use the Taser."<br><br>"Could've used it on Everett," he said. "But good to see cooler heads prevailed."<br><br>It was about as high praise as the police chief gave, and Emmaline felt a small rush of pride. Granted, it had been an idiotic call in the first place, but still.<br><br>Levi, who'd been a year behind her in high school, stood and picked up a bouquet of red roses wrapped in green florist paper and tied with a white ribbon. His look warned her not to say anything.<br><br>"Aw," she said. "Flowers for the wife? You're such a snuggly teddy bear, Levi."<br><br>"Inappropriate, Officer Neal," he said, giving her his famous "I tolerate you because I have to" look. "By the way, about that crisis negotiations class. I got you a grant. You start in two weeks."<br><br>"You did? Oh, you're the best! I take back every complaint I ever filed about you."<br><br>"Very funny," her boss said. "I'm going home. Maybe I'll see you at O'Rourke's later."<br><br>"Maybe. Tell Pregnita I said hi."<br><br>He smiled and left the office, stopping to say something to Carol before he left the station.<br><br>It was hard not to feel a little jealous. Levi and Faith had been married a little over a year and had a baby on the way. Seemed like everyone was getting married these days; Em had been to three weddings over the summer. In fact, she was considering marrying herself, just so she could register for the fun housewares.<br><br>Well. Time for her to go home, too. The O'Keefe Emergency Services Building, which housed the fire, police and ambulance departments, was about five minutes from town. Em drove past Hastings Farm, past the high school and into the Village part of Mannings-port, three blocks around a small green at the edge of Keuka Lake.<br><br>Emmaline lived on Water Street, right next to the library, and often parked the cruiser along the green where the good people of Manningsport could see it and reconsider any bad decisions, like driving under the influence. O'Rourke's Tavern, the only place in town open year-round, glowed warm and bright. Maybe she'd eat there tonight, since she didn't have any plans. But first, home to the Wonder Pup&#x2014;Sarge, her recently acquired German shepherd puppy, who'd need a walk and some exercise, despite his doggy door to the backyard.<br><br>She got out of the cruiser, her breath fogging in the cold, clean air.<br><br>"Hey, Em!" called a voice. Lorelei Buzzetta and Gerard Chartier waved as they went into O'Rourke's, and Em waved back. Gerard was a firefighter and paramedic. Em saw him nearly every day at work (and also saw Lorelei, who owned the bakery and could make the angels weep with her chocolate croissants). The two had started dating a while back.<br><br>Through the windows, she could see Colleen O'Rourke, now Colleen Campbell, kissing her gorgeous husband, Lucas. There was Honor Holland and her husband, the lovely Tom Barlow. Paulie Petrosinsky and Bryce, who ran the animal shelter and had fixed her up with her puppy just two weeks ago.<br><br>Seemed like couples' night at the pub.<br><br>Maybe she'd stay in tonight. She and Sarge could watch YouTube videos of hostage negotiators, eat Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese (don't judge, it was delicious). Maybe binge-watch <em>The Walking Dead.</em> She had a stack of books from the library, too. Or she could call around the Bitter Betrayeds, the name her book club had given itself, and see who else was climbing the walls.<br><br>Suddenly, the weekend spread vast and empty in front of her. No shifts till Monday. No plans other than a hockey game on Sunday&#x2014;she played in the town league. She could do laundry and clean. Um...maybe buy some new towels. Go to the shooting range. That'd be fun, if solitary.<br><br>Her feet were getting numb. Time to get moving. Still, she stood there on the tiny town green, looking into the cheerful pub.<br><br>Maybe she'd drive to Penn Yan and see a movie, but it was a half an hour away, and there was more snow in the forecast. And after the big accident, everyone was feeling a little wary about winter driving.<br><br>Speaking of that, there was Jack Holland.<br><br>He stood outside O'Rourke's, staring at the building as if he'd never seen it before. Maybe she should check on him. They played hockey together, and he was her boss's brother-in-law and an EMT, so it wasn't as though she didn't know him.<br><br>He didn't move, seeming to be trying to decide whether or not to go inside the bar.<br><br>Em crossed the street. "Hey, Jack," she said.<br><br>He didn't answer.<br><br>"Hi, Jack," she said again. He jerked, then looked at her.<br><br>"Hey, Emmaline," he said, forcing a smile. "How you doing?"<br><br>"Great."<br><br>He was so <em>not</em> great that her heart ached, looking at him stalled there, dead in the water.<br><br>Poor choice of words.<br><br>But he was clearly not great.<br><br>"You going in?" he asked, aware perhaps that too long a pause had elapsed.<br><br>"No. I'm headed home. I just got a puppy. Sarge. He's a German shepherd. Very cute. Hopefully he hasn't pooped on the floor."<br><br>Oh, yeah, the babbling thing. See, in addition to all the above, Jack Holland was ridiculously gorgeous. As in, <em>Hi, I've just dropped down from Mount Olympus. How you doin'?</em> Tall and blond with eyes that were so clear and perfect and pure that they made a person think of all sorts of ridiculous synonyms for blue&#x2014;azure and cerulean and aqua. His smile stopped traffic and made trees burst into flower and all that crap.<br><br>So yes, he rendered women stupid. Even women who were slightly prejudiced against very, very good-looking men. But everyone, including Emmaline, also knew that Jack was a tremendously nice guy.<br><br>"Jack? You okay?"<br><br>"Yeah!" he said too quickly. "Sorry. Just a little tired. You take care, Emma."<br><br>No one called her that. More than likely, Jack Holland had just forgotten her name. He opened the door to the pub. There was a roar of "Jack!" and "Hey! The hero!" and general cheering. The iron bell behind the bar clanged; the O'Rourke twins rang it in times of celebration. Poor guy.<br><br>Emmaline knew that the good folks of Mannings-port&#x2014;and America&#x2014;had been quite dazzled with what Jack Holland had done. So had she. How many people could have done what he did, after all? It <em>was</em> dazzling.<br><br>Which didn't explain the look on Jack's face.<br><br>Well. He had a big family and a lot of friends. Everyone loved the Hollands. He'd be well taken care of.<br><br>With a deep breath of the frigid air, Emmaline went around the corner to her house, a little bungalow. She'd left a couple of lights on for the puppy, and her little house fairly glowed with welcome.<br><br>Emmaline wasn't a Manningsport native, but she'd gone to high school here, living with her grandmother in this very house. Nana had died four years ago and left the house to Em and her sister, Angela, who lived in California. But to Em, the bungalow meant more than just home&#x2014;it was where she'd found refuge and normalcy back in the day...and again when she'd moved here three years ago. She'd kept a lot of Nana's furniture, bought some of her own, painted here and there, and the result was a pleasing mix of old and new, no real style per se, but comfortable and cheery, and it never failed to make her smile.<br><br>She scooped her mail from the little brass mailbox, unlocked the door and got down on all fours. "Mommy's home," she said.<br><br>The scrabbling of paws and yips of joy were happy music of the soul.<br><br>Sarge ran to her, Squeaky Chicken, his favorite toy, in his jaws as an offering.<br><br>Emmaline gathered the puppy into her arms and kissed his furry head. "Hello, puppy," she said. She resisted the strong urge to indulge in baby talk to the dog to preserve his dignity and her own, but she couldn't help laughing as he licked her face, wriggling like a little otter.<br><br>She stood up, did a few twirls, since he loved that, then encouraged him to go outside before he peed on the floor from excitement. He galloped out, chasing a leaf across the small, fenced-in backyard.<br><br>Em flipped through her mail. A flyer for a discount on heart-shaped cookies and cupcakes at Lorelei's Sunrise Bakery&#x2014;Valentine's Day preorders now accepted. No need to save that, unless she wanted to buy herself some goodies (which she did, though her uniform pants seemed a little hostile these days). A bill from the cable company. A postcard from her sister. <em>Saluti da Milano!</em> Right. Flawless Angela had been in Italy at, yes, an astrophysicists' convention.<br><br>Em flipped the card over. "Hello, sis! Hope you're doing well. I haven't been able to see much of Milan yet, but I hope to squeeze a few days of holiday after the convention. Hope to catch up soon! Love and kisses, Angela."<br><br>That was nice. Her sister, younger by four years, was incredibly thoughtful. She was Daughter 2.0, adopted from Ethiopia when Em went away to high school. The kind of daughter Dr. and Dr. Neal hoped to have, though they never said anything like that. Angela was brilliant, kind, cheerful and also stunningly beautiful with her glowing brown skin and enormous, expressive eyes. She'd modeled in college, even. If Emmaline didn't love her so much, it'd be really easy to hate her.</p><h2>Field Guide to the Flower Flies of Northeastern North America (Princeton Field Guides, 134)</h2><p><p><b>A groundbreaking guide to flower flies in North America </b></p><p>This is the first comprehensive field guide to the flower flies (also known as hover flies) of northeastern North America.

What is the evidence to support its success? Christians engaged in the fields of psychology, psychotherapy and counseling are living in a unique moment. Over the last couple decades, these fields have grown more and more open to religious belief and religion-accommodative therapies. At the same time, Christian counselors and psychotherapists encounter pressure (for example, from insurance companies) to demonstrate that their accommodative therapies are as beneficial as secular therapies. This raises the need for evidence to support Christian practices and treatments. The essays gathered in this volume explore evidence-based Christian treatments, practices, factors and principles. The authors mine the relevant research and literature to update practicing psychotherapists, clinical researchers, students, teachers and educated laypersons about the efficacy of certain Christian-accommodative therapies. Topics covered in the book include: <ul><li>devotional meditation</li><li>cognitive-behavior therapy</li><li>psychodynamic and process-experiential therapies</li><li>couples, marriage and family therapy</li><li>group intervention</li></ul> The book concludes with a review of the evidence for the various treatments discussed in the chapters, a guide for conducting clinical trials that is essential reading for current or aspiring researchers, and reflections by the editors about the future of evidence-based Christian practices. As the editors say, "more research is necessary." To that end, this volume is a major contribution to a field of inquiry that, while still in its infancy, promises to have enormous implications for future work in Christian counseling and psychotherapy.</p><p>Everett L.

This volume is timely and essential, reflecting both Christian wisdom and prevailing professional standards." (Mark R. McMinn, professor of psychology, George Fox University)<br><br>"The concept of evidence-based practice is continually evolving and needs to be applied more systematically to a Christian context. In this volume, top researcher-clinicians come together to provide the state of the art of evidence-based practices for Christian counseling and psychotherapy.

As with his other gigs, he sets rules for himself: no leaving the house for any reason, refrain from outside contact, and sleep during the day.<br> When Thomas Ruth, Felix's oldest friend and fellow horror film obsessive, joins him on the project, the two dance around a recent and unspeakably painful rough-patch in their friendship, but eventually fall into their old rhythms of dark humor and movie trivia. That's when things start going wrong: screams from upstairs, figures in the thresholds, and more than what should be in any basement. Felix realizes the book he's writing, and his very state of mind, is tilting from nonfiction into all out horror, and the shocking climax answers a question that's been staring these men in the face all along: In Rotter House, who's haunting who?</p><p>J.

The cats were skittish around people, yet they came to his neighbor&#x2019;s yard each evening. At seven o&#x2019;clock sharp, Frank would play his harmonica and put out cans of food, and the cats would gather and rub up against his legs.<br> <br>The two would talk to each other, while Jake sat in a lawn chair on the roof of his trailer house. Jake&#x2019;s mother, Krystal, found it odd that Frank talked at all, told Jake that Frank was the shyest person in Quinn, the only permanent stranger in a town of 956. Unlike Frank, his mother was well known, and as a nurse, she was useful. His mother refused to wear any makeup, despite her thin lips. Krystal had enormous green eyes and glossy brown hair that hung past her shoulder blades, content to be a natural beauty. She wore her hospital scrubs at home, and no jewelry. Jake found it frustrating to shop for his mother.<br> <br>Jake had been coming to the rooftop since he was seven years old, when Krystal stopped noticing what he was doing as long as he was in the yard. From the roof, Jake could see all of the trailer court and parts of the town. He was twelve now, and he no longer spied on his neighbors. After five years, he realized that they were gross. Now he came to the roof for refuge. The space belonged to him, and he furnished it with a lawn chair and a waterproof tub that held his paperbacks, a parasol, and a pile of cassette singles. He sat on the roof through most of the year, sat there for hours, even in winter, when he sat until he could no longer bear it. His perch had revealed who was having affairs with the UPS man, who was eating too much when they thought nobody was watching, who was stealing checks from mailboxes. Jake was not a private detective, but he had a private-detective outfit. He also had several piles of polyester leisure suits and a complete set of motorcycle leathers.<br> <br>Jake listened only to Madonna when he was on the roof. He listened to Madonna and watched the sky instead of the dirty loop of trailer houses; it was too painful to regard his tiny universe, the town seemed so foreshortened and filthy. His Walkman had a voracious appetite, and Jake had lost many cassettes, had tried to repair the ribbon when it stretched and wound until it broke. He fixed most of them with a cunning little piece of Scotch tape, and it usually worked, only a little blip and squeal before the gospel choir kicked in during &#x201c;Like a Prayer.&#x201d;<br> <br>He had found rosary beads at the thrift store, and he wore these as he listened to Madonna, even though he was not religious. He wore three necklaces at a time: glass, baby-blue stones, and wood. He knew he was supposed to say a prayer and finger every bead, but instead he named his enemies. It seemed impossible that he had fifty-nine enemies, but the football team took up thirty-two, and there were twenty-seven other bullies and assholes in town. According to Jake&#x2019;s math, he disliked one-sixteenth of the town. Frank was not one of them.<br> <br>The cats came around despite the freezing weather. Some nights, Frank built a tiny fire in a washtub. He played his harmonica, surrounded by piles of empty cans of cat food, and the flames shone on the tins and cast the snowy yard in waves of reflected light.<br> <br>When Frank wasn&#x2019;t playing music, he recited facts and observations to Jake: the harmonica was the Special 20, model number 560 manufactured by Hohner, plastic comb instead of wooden. Frank told Jake that feral cats woke at four in the afternoon, that their hunting parties went out at six, and then they went back to sleep after he fed them. The cats woke again at three in the morning, foraged for the next three hours, slept all day. Jake thought that they were much like Bert, Krystal&#x2019;s boyfriend.<br> <br>Bert was a human barnacle that had attached itself to Jake and Krystal&#x2019;s trailer house in 1989. He courted them with shopping trips to Spokane, boxes of garage sale books, a new furnace for the trailer. He promised to be a father figure. As soon as Bert moved in, he never moved again, leaving the couch only to go to the bar. He was surly and possessive, drunk and useless, and worst of all, fertile. Krystal was pregnant within a month.<br> <br>Before Bert came, Frank had built a small storage shed for Jake, shoved up against the siding, between the back door and Jake&#x2019;s bedroom window. Frank knew that Jake&#x2019;s thrift store purchases were piled to the ceiling in his bedroom, each article of clothing perfectly folded but sandwiched so tightly that Jake was constantly ironing. Frank worked silently, building the shed out of cedar, so Jake&#x2019;s clothes would smell less like old people and more like expensive people. He added a gambrel roof, sturdy enough to support Jake&#x2019;s weight. Now Jake could climb out of his bedroom window and use the roof of the storage shed to push himself up to the flat metal panels on the top of the trailer house.<br> <br>After Bert moved in, Frank built a privacy fence around his entire property in the summer of 1990. Bert had started trapping Frank&#x2019;s feral cats in the alley, collecting them in metal cages. He drove to the boating launch and threw the cages in the shallows of the river. Bert described this process in detail but was secretive about what he did with the bodies. Frank&#x2019;s fence was six feet high, enough to shield Frank from the sight of Bert drinking in the yard, the sight of Bert entirely.<br> <br>Jake&#x2019;s best friend, Misty, lived with her mother on the left side of Frank&#x2019;s new fence. They had grown up together in the trailer court, walking endlessly around the unpaved loop of twenty-six houses and a Laundromat, throwing rocks at swallows&#x2019; nests. Misty blasted heavy metal at all hours.<br> <br>Bert caused just as much commotion. When he had no one to fight with, Bert fought with himself, and loudly. Bert was the kind of drunk who fell on and off the wagon so many times that he called everybody at the bar by their last names and everybody at AA meetings by their first.<br> <br>Frank was surrounded by this chaos but never called the cops. He was meek, a slight man with a thick dark beard. When he wasn&#x2019;t feeding the cats, he watched the mountains with binoculars. He told Jake that he used to spend his summers in the fire lookouts and that these habits were hard to break. He looked for fire, even in the winter. Frank wore only bright yellow work shirts and dark green pants, and he told Jake that he had retired early from the Forest Service but never explained why.<br> <br>The week before Christmas, Jake combed through the thrift shop, found several suits that looked like they would fit. Frank was silent when Jake brought them to his front porch, wrapped carefully, freshly cleaned by hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;I guessed your sizes,&#x201d; Jake said. Frank said nothing, just accepted the neatly folded pile. &#x201c;I thought you would look best in earth tones,&#x201d; explained Jake. &#x201c;Browns and greens, mostly. You&#x2019;ll love the ties. I even found one with pine trees. There&#x2019;s also a gray-and-red plaid jacket, and I figured you could wear it with blue jeans. Do you own any blue jeans?&#x201d;<br> <br>Frank remained silent.<br> <br>The next night, Jake took his place on the roof, careful not to trip on the wires of Christmas lights Krystal had draped over the gutters. He had finally bought the entire &#x201c;Like a Prayer&#x201d; album, and a different rosary for every track, upping his collection to fourteen. Plastic or pearl, he had a necklace for every song and wore them on the outside of his snowsuit. He wrapped himself in blankets; the lawn chair was covered in new snow, and he sat on a plastic bag so his pants wouldn&#x2019;t get wet. Frank began his concert for the cats, but ended it early after only twenty minutes. He blew into his bare hands, which must have been frozen; Frank could not play harmonica with mittens. The cats ate greedily, and Jake watched a skinny pair fight over a can of pork and beans. Inside the trailer, Jake and Frank could hear Krystal and Bert fighting about getting cable television, and their new baby was crying. Frank walked over to the fence and threw the harmonica up to Jake, and then he turned away and went inside his house, without speaking a word.<br> <br>The ambulance came the next day. Krystal heard the details on the police scanner and told Jake to go to his room. He watched out his window as the volunteer firemen came in their massive vehicles, followed closely by the van of the volunteer ambulance. There were no sirens. Then the cars came to the trailer court&#x2014;the onlookers. It was as if every person who lived in town had heard the dispatch on the police scanner. Jake snuck out of his window and found Misty on the street. Even in the freezing cold, Bert lay drunkenly in the yard, tangled up in a lawn chair, but the crowd paid no attention. Misty and Jake hid in the alley, behind a Dumpster that was missing a wheel, and Misty smoked a cigarette as the volunteer fire department surrounded the stretcher.<br> <br>Jake and Misty watched as they brought out Frank&#x2019;s body.<br> <br>&#x201c;I bet it was suicide,&#x201d; pronounced Misty. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s fucking hard-core.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He never told me he was sad,&#x201d; said Jake.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wonder if he used a gun,&#x201d; said Misty.<br> <br>They watched until they were spotted by Krystal. &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t be seeing this!&#x201d; she yelled at them as they tried to cower behind the Dumpster.<br> <br>The winter grew thicker and darker, and Jake still thought of Frank. He kept the harmonica under his bed. Every morning, Jake shoved open the back door, kicked at the snow that had piled upon the cinder blocks of the back steps, and trudged in his slippers to the storage shed. He thought of Frank as he picked out his clothes for the day. Krystal would not speak of Frank&#x2019;s death, would not declare it a suicide. Bert claimed that the cats had eaten him.<br> <br>For a few weeks, Jake bought cat food and stood in Frank&#x2019;s backyard. The cats came, but Jake could only hum. Jake hung his glass rosary on Frank&#x2019;s doorknob. The last week of January, Bert caught him and gave him a split lip for trespassing.<br> <br>After that, Jake watched from the roof as the cats came around for a few more days, mewling and licking at the empty cans. Eventually, they found somewhere else to go. Jake hoped they were welcomed and sere�naded, hoped they had found a new home.<br> <br>By the time Jake&#x2019;s lip healed, there were no more cats. Bert had trapped them all, Frank was gone, and only the harmonica remained. Frank&#x2019;s yard and trailer stayed untouched, the snow piling in deeper drifts around the front door.</p><h2>Many Thousand Gone: African Americans from Slavery to Freedom</h2><p>Unavailable for several years, Virginia Hamilton&#x2019;s award-winning companion to <i>The People Could Fly</i> traces the history of slavery in America in the voices and stories of those who lived it.

You don&#x2019;t have to be an expert in the subject of online behavior to have observed that something about cyberspace provokes people to be more adventurous.<br><br>The illusion is that the cyber environment is safer than real life&#x2014;�and connecting with other people online somehow carries fewer risks than face-�to-�face contact. But our instincts were trained and honed for the real world, and in the absence of real-�world cues and other subtle pieces of information&#x2014;�facial expressions, body language, physical spaces&#x2014;�we aren&#x2019;t able to make fully informed decisions. And because we aren&#x2019;t face-�to-�face when we are communicating and interacting with others online, we can be anonymous or, more important, we feel we are. As discussed in the prologue to this book, we can feel freed up and emboldened online. People can lose their inhibitions and in a way &#x201c;act drunk&#x201d; because, for some, being in the cyber environment can impair judgment and increase impulsivity, somewhat similar to the way alcohol can. Disinhibition is facilitated by the environmental conditions of cyberspace&#x2014;�by the perceived lack of authority, the anonymity, as well as the sense of distance or physical remove.<br><br>You see this in the changing courtship rituals of self-�curated selfies and sexts, and in flirtatious exchanges on social-�networking sites. Online, we feel more comfortable being bold and explicit. An individual may demonstrate common sense, rationality, and restraint in real life and check these qualities at the door when entering cyberspace. Why?<br><br>In cyberpsychology, the explanation for this emboldened behavior is known as the online disinhibition effect, first introduced by John Suler and now highly cited and accepted by academics in the field. Another powerful factor comes into play, which I have studied and written about, online escalation. It is a construct or concept that I use to describe how problem behaviors become bigger&#x2014;�or amplified&#x2014;�online, as many of us have already witnessed in everything from supernegative exchanges via flaming emails, aggressive texts, and offensive posts to comment threads that are meant to provoke.<br><br>It isn&#x2019;t that technology is bad for us&#x2014;�or inherently negative. Problems occur when we are ignorant of its impact. Most people don&#x2019;t understand the effect that the environment of cyberspace can have on them. They think it&#x2019;s the same as anywhere else. Individuals who behave impulsively, or struggle with a tendency to act rashly, may be especially vulnerable. But due to the effect of online escalation, anyone can move more quickly into new behavior and new norms.<br><br>Later on, in a chapter about cyber romance, I will discuss the new ways people meet, make friends, form communities, and find meaningful personal connections online. In this chapter, though, I&#x2019;ll be exploring the impact of technology on a smaller slice of the population, specifically individuals with a fetish or paraphilia&#x2014;�what is considered atypical sexual behavior. Why bother looking so closely at one specific population online? By studying the extreme effects of technology on fringe or unusual behavior, we begin to see more clearly the implications of the cyber environment for all of us. As a forensic cyberpsychologist, I&#x2019;ve seen this demonstrated time and again: Whenever technology comes in contact with an underlying predisposition, or tendency for a certain behavior, it can result in behavioral amplification or escalation.<br><br>I would argue that tendencies and vulnerabilities that cause the most distress in real life may become even more of a battle online. That goes for any behavior.<br><br>If these tendencies aren&#x2019;t destructive or risky, the impact can be fairly benign. If someone just loves to visit online forums for gardeners, there isn&#x2019;t much that&#x2019;s self-�destructive about that. But there are many incidences of risky behavior becoming much riskier online, especially pathological and criminal behavior. Here&#x2019;s an example of what I mean: A stalker in the real world typically focuses on one victim at any given time, but a cyberstalker can stalk multiple victims simultaneously because technology makes that possible. Cyberstalking is considered an evolution of a real-�world criminal behavior. Cyberspace is a breeding ground for mutations. Real-�world behavior migrates there and escalates or accelerates. This can sometimes have serious implications in the real world.<br><br>A Case of Cranking<br><br>Jordan Haskins had grand dreams of making a difference in sparsely populated Saginaw County, Michigan, his hometown. The pale, clean-�cut twenty-�three-�year-�old man described himself as &#x201c;pro-�life, pro-�family, pro-�freedom, and pro-�faith.&#x201d; In the summer of 2014, while still a student at Maranatha Baptist University, he announced he was running for political office, hoping to serve as a state representative to Michigan&#x2019;s 95th District. He posed for his campaign website photograph with the best smile he could muster, his image superimposed on a background of a billowing American flag, a sepia-�toned Declaration of Independence, and artwork that appeared to be the three crosses of Calvary, synonymous with crucifixion, in dark outline.<br><br>The Republican candidate said his love of history, philosophy, religion, and politics had led him to run for office&#x2014;�and give back to society. He&#x2019;d realized that his gift was for government.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve found my niche,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;my passion.&#x201d;<br><br>He had other passions, as it turns out. Before his campaign was fully under way, he found himself needing to explain his criminal record. He had been charged and pleaded guilty to four violations of trespassing on private and public property and unlawful use of government vehicles during a period of ten months in 2010 and 2011.<br><br>When interrogated by police at the time of his arrest, Haskins admitted that he had twice broken into a government yard where a mosquito-�control pickup truck and sheriff&#x2019;s cruiser were parked in order to pull the spark-�plug wires loose on the vehicles, sit in the front seat of the cars, and masturbate while listening to the engines sparking.<br><br>This behavior is called &#x201c;cranking,&#x201d; he explained to police. He was sentenced to one year and eight months in prison in 2011. Parole was lifted just eleven days prior to the election. &#x201c;I was in a messed-�up state of mind mentally and emotionally when I did what I did,&#x201d; the candidate told the local media when asked in 2014 about his felony convictions. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the only way I can even explain it.&#x201d;<br><br>Cranking? What on earth possessed him to jump the fence into the police department parking lot, break into a car, and the rest . . . <br><br>&#x201c;It was just the fun and the risk and the thrill,&#x201d; Haskins said.<br><br>And how had he discovered this bizarre fetishistic behavior?<br><br>&#x201c;I read about it online.&#x201d;<br><br>Anatomy of a Fetish<br><br>At the back of New Age shops and hippie stores, next to the incense and patchouli oil, you&#x2019;ll find shelves of little carvings for sale. Inspired by the practices of Native American animism and West African religious cults, these small charms in the shape of animals are believed to be imbued with supernatural powers, carrying energy, communications from the spirit world&#x2014;�or simply good luck. Each of these objects is called a &#x201c;fetish.&#x201d;<br><br>The use of the word fetish for an object that causes sexual arousal is attributed to French psychologist Alfred Binet, who is best known for devising the earliest intelligence tests. In common usage, a fetish describes a strong compulsion or desire for a particular condition or activity. A woman might say, lightheartedly, &#x201c;I have a shoe fetish,&#x201d; meaning to suggest that she spends a disproportionate amount of her income on footwear. A man might say that stiletto heels excite him. In fact, feet and objects associated with feet are the most common fetishes. In psychology, fetishistic disorder is a mental health condition centering on the use of inanimate objects as a source of sexual satisfaction. <br><br>What causes one to develop a fetish in the first place? Sigmund Freud argued in his famous 1927 essay on fetishism that sexual fetishes were the result of arrested psychosexual development. Freud wrote: &#x201c;When now I announce that the fetish is a substitute for the penis, I shall certainly create disappointment; so I hasten to add that it is not a substitute for any chance penis, but for a particular and quite special penis that had been extremely important in early childhood but had later been lost. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Interestingly, Freud believed that the predominance of foot and shoe fetishes could be explained by a child&#x2019;s early memories of being on the floor and peering up a woman&#x2019;s skirt.<br><br>Freud&#x2019;s views and theories have many critics. Numerous contemporary psychologists are skeptical of his therapeutic approach, psychoanalysis, and have distanced themselves from it. I happen to value the work of Freud because it often helps to illuminate complex behavioral issues, and these days psychoanalytic theory has also advanced well beyond Freud&#x2019;s ideas. More contemporary psychoanalytic approaches have different explanations for fetishes, and describe how they can become a way for individuals to maintain a cohesive sense of self. But in general, other schools within psychology now hold sway, from Jean Piaget&#x2019;s theory of cognitive development to Erik Erikson&#x2019;s theory of psychosocial development. Currently there&#x2019;s enormous interest in biopsychology, and how the brain and neurotransmitters influence our behavior.<br><br>I suspect if he were alive today, Freud would be keenly interested in the impact of technology on humankind. Since he argued that sexual impulses were at the root of most behavior, I&#x2019;m sure he would identify sexual impulses as a contributor to some cyberbehavior.<br><br>Is sex behind all obscure behavior? Even Freud himself supposedly once said, &#x201c;Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.&#x201d;<br><br>Childhood experiences, though, do seem to explain some fetishes. As psychologist Robert Crooks and sex therapist Karla Baur write in their academic textbook, Our Sexuality, a boy may associate arousal with objects that belong to an emotionally significant person. The process of this association is sometimes referred to as symbolic transformation, when the object of the fetish becomes imaginatively endowed with the power or essence of its owner. In contemporary psychoanalysis the fetish is a self object, or an object that represents a significant other&#x2014;�usually a parent.<br><br>Some experts argue that fetishistic behavior has similarities with obsessive-�compulsive disorder. And like OCD, once ingrained, a fetish is an urge that is difficult to deny&#x2014;�a behavior that is very hard to resist. The conditioning process is commonly thought by modern psychologists to reinforce the fetish. Like Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov&#x2019;s famous dogs that salivated whenever they saw Pavlov&#x2019;s lab assistant, because they anticipated being fed, there is an anticipation of a reward when seeing the fetish object or thinking about the fetish behavior. In Haskins&#x2019;s cranking case, he had prior arrests as a juvenile for breaking into cars and joyriding, and perhaps these were thrilling adventures that he continually wanted to relive. Each time he broke into a car, his behavior was rewarded&#x2014;�reinforcing and strengthening the fetish. The more he took risks to do a little cranking, the more ingrained the behavior became. This is how conditioning works.<br><br>The growing number of websites catering to sexual fetishes involving cars (including pedalsupreme.com, which offers &#x201c;pedal pumping, engine cranking, leg and foot videos and pictures&#x201d;) is a sign that this is an escalating trend. There is also a YouTube channel, pumpthatpedaldotcom, which offers a new installment every week. According to sexologist Dr. Susan Block, one possible psychological explanation for this behavior is that the &#x201c; &#x2018;vroom&#x2019; of the engine reminds them of their own libidos being revved up.&#x201d;<br><br>A fetish can be created in a lab. In one classical conditioning experiment a group of male subjects in a laboratory were repeatedly shown erotic slides of nude women. Occasionally, an image of women&#x2019;s boots would appear in the slideshow. Soon the men had a sexual response to the photograph of boots alone, and over time they responded to images of other types of women&#x2019;s shoes. If a photograph of a pair of women&#x2019;s boots could be used so easily to condition desire, imagine how the Internet with its infinite supply of images could inspire, instill, and sustain a fetish.<br><br>That brings us back to Jordan Haskins, who lost the election for the 95th District after he&#x2019;d become a viral story&#x2014;�and the subject of unkind scrutiny and fascination. &#x201c;You may not respect my policies, you may not respect my ideas, but you at least have to respect me as a person,&#x201d; Haskins said. But I don&#x2019;t think too many people did.<br><br>Politicians + Paraphilia<br><br>Unusual sexual behaviors were once labeled &#x201c;deviant&#x201d; or &#x201c;perverted,&#x201d; even in clinical references. More recently, a less charged, less judgmental umbrella term, paraphilia, was adopted to describe a range of atypical behaviors that include fetishes. Paraphilia means &#x201c;beyond usual or typical love.&#x201d; This alludes to the fact that these behaviors are not commonly associated with a traditional romantic relationship. Given the apparent rise in the number of websites catering to paraphilia, atypical sexual behavior may be becoming more common.<br><br>You don&#x2019;t have to look too far for examples in public life of individuals who, like Jordan Haskins, had everything to lose&#x2014;�and lost it&#x2014;�when unusual or bizarre sexual behavior was exposed. I&#x2019;m thinking of U.S. congressman Anthony Weiner and the explicit photographs of himself that he sent to unsuspecting women he&#x2019;d met online. I&#x2019;m thinking of U.S. senator David Vitter and his urge to be diapered, which required the services of prostitutes. And I&#x2019;m thinking of New York governor Eliot Spitzer, who insisted on keeping on his calf-�length black socks when he had sex with a call girl. Remarkably enough, the marriages of these politicians survived after their unusual sexual habits came to light. The actor David Carradine, who was found dead and hanging inside a hotel room closet, wasn&#x2019;t so fortunate. According to an ex-�wife, he was into an extremely dangerous autoerotic asphyxiation paraphilia called hypoxyphilia, consisting of practices that restrict the flow of oxygen to the brain for sexual arousal. <br><br>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, or DSM-�5, the most recent version of the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental health professionals worldwide, breaks down paraphilia into eight main types of disorders: exhibitionistic disorder, fetishistic disorder, frotteuristic disorder, pedophilic disorder, sexual masochism disorder, sexual sadism disorder, transvestic disorder, and voyeuristic disorder. The behavior being described in most of these terms is probably not too difficult to figure out, since the clinical words have entered common speech, with the exception of frotteurism, a disorder in which a person derives sexual pleasure or gratification by rubbing himself, or his genitalia, against another person&#x2014;�usually in a crowd (a good reason to avoid overly crowded subway cars at rush hour).</p><h2>Hacking Exposed 7: Network Security Secrets and Solutions</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>The latest tactics for thwarting digital attacks</b></p><p>&#x201c;Our new reality is zero-day, APT, and state-sponsored attacks.

All our unknown potentialities come alive before our eyes. Most importantly, we appreciate how these untapped possibilities within us relate to our daily life, how they can transform it from the inside, as it were, and how, ultimately, Sri Aurobindo's experience leads to a "divine rehabilitation of Matter."<br>"We have denied the Divinity in Matter, to confine it instead in our holy places, but now Matter is taking its revenge. We call Matter crude, and crude it is. As long as we tolerate this imbalance between Matter and Spirit, there is no hope for the earth.

Atile&#x2019;i&#x2019;s Last Night</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>The people of Wayo Wayo thought the whole world was but a single island.<br>&nbsp;<br>The island was situated in the midst of an immense ocean, far from any continent. As far as island memory reached, the white man had once visited the island, but nobody had ever left and brought back news of another land. In the beginning, people believed, there was nothing but a shoreless sea, until Kabang (the word for &#x201c;God&#x201d; in the Wayo Wayoan language) created the island for them to live on, as if placing a small, hollow clamshell in a tub of water. The island followed the tides, floating around in the ocean, which was a source of sustenance for the people. But some of the ocean&#x2019;s spawn were the avatars of Kabang. The <i>asamu,</i> for instance, was a black-and-white fish sent to spy on people, and to test them. For this reason, it was counted among the creatures that could not be eaten.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;If you are so careless as to eat an <i>asamu,</i> you will grow a ring of scales around your navel, a ring of scales that you could never finish peeling off your whole life long.&#x201d; Leaning on a whalerib staff, the Sea Sage hobbled over and sat under a tree every day at dusk to tell the little ones all the stories of the sea. He talked until the sun dipped below the waves. He talked until the boys became youths, and until the youths endured the rite of passage and became men. His speech carried the smell of the sea, and there was salt on his every breath.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So what if we grow scales?&#x201d; one boy asked. The children here all had enormous eyes, like the eyes of a nocturnal animal.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh my child, people can&#x2019;t grow scales, just like a sea turtle can&#x2019;t sleep with its belly to the sky.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Another day, the Earth Sage took the children to the field in the hollow, to the place where the <i>akaba</i> grew. One of the only starchy plants on the island, the luxuriant <i>akaba, </i>a word that meant &#x201c;shaped like the palm of a hand,&#x201d; seemed to raise innumerable hands in supplication to the sky. The island was small and the people lacked farming tools, so pebbles were piled around the plots, to keep the soil moist and to serve as a windbreak. &#x201c;You must love the land, my children, and ring it in with your love. For the land is the most precious thing on this island. It is like rain, like the heart of a woman.&#x201d; The Earth Sage showed the children how to arrange the rocks. His skin was dry like cracked mud, and his back was arched like an earthen mound. &#x201c;In all the world, the only things worth trusting in are the land, the sea and Kabang, my children.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>At the southeast corner of the island was a coral lagoon, a good place to catch fish with thrownets or to collect clams. To the northeast, at a distance of ten husks (ten throws of a coconut husk) there was a cay, a&nbsp;coral reef that was fully exposed at ebb tide. This was where the seabirds flocked. The Wayo Wayoans hunted the birds with <i>gawana</i>. To make a <i>gawana,</i> they tied branches into a tool that had the virtues of club and spear, with one end blunt and the other end sharpened to a point; then they passed a rope of saltgrass through a hole in the blunt end and tied one end into a noose. Armed with a <i>gawana, </i>a fisherman would row his <i>talawaka</i> near the cay and let the ocean current carry him along, pretending to ignore the birds as he prayed to Kabang. When he drifted within range he would hurl his <i>gawana.</i> Blessed by Kabang, the noose would slip, just so, over a seabird&#x2019;s neck, and a deft flick of the wrist would impale the bird on the pointy end. Blood would trickle down from the point, as if the <i>gawana</i> itself had suffered a mortal wound. The only resistance the albatross, the booby, the pelican, the petrel and the seagull could put up was prolifer-ation. When the birds stopped in spring to build nests, people would feast on eggs, wearing cruel and satisfied smiles on their faces.<br>&nbsp;<br>As on any island, there was never enough fresh water on Wayo Wayo. The only sources were rain and a lake at the center of the island. Consisting mainly of fish and fowl, the diet was salty, giving the people a thin and dark appearance and often leaving them constipated. At dawn they would squat over pit latrines, facing away from the sea, often getting teary-eyed from the strain.<br>&nbsp;<br>The island was so small that most people could set out after breakfast, walk all the way around and return not long after lunch. For the same reason, people were accustomed to a rough parlance of &#x201c;facing the sea&#x201d; or &#x201c;facing away&#x201d; to orient themselves, and the only way to face away was to face the hillock at the center of the island. People talked facing the sea and ate facing away. They conducted rituals facing the sea, and made love facing away, so as not to offend Kabang. There were no chiefs among the people, only &#x201c;elders,&#x201d; the wisest of whom were called &#x201c;old men of the sea.&#x201d; The front door of the home of a family in which an old man of the sea had lived faced the shore. Adorned with shells and carvings, Wayo Wayoan houses looked like capsized canoes. They stuck fish skin to the walls, and the whole community would gather round and build a coral fence out in front to block the wind. The islanders could neither walk to a place where the sea could not be heard nor have a conversation in which the sea was not mentioned. In the morning, they greeted each other, &#x201c;Are you going to sea?&#x201d; At noon they asked, &#x201c;Shall we test our luck at sea?&#x201d; And at night, even if the weather had been too rough to go fishing today, they exhorted one another, &#x201c;You must remember me a story of the sea.&#x201d; As a rule, the Wayo Wayo went fishing every day. Fishermen who met on shore would yell, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let the <i>mona&#x2019;e</i> steal your name!&#x201d; <i>Mona&#x2019;e</i> meant wave. When people bumped into one another, one would ask, &#x201c;So how&#x2019;s the weather at sea?&#x201d; Even if a gale was blowing, the other had to reply, &#x201c;Very fair.&#x201d; The tonality of the Wayo Wayoan language was sharp and sonorous, like birdsong, with each utterance ending in a light trill and a plop, like a hungry seabird that swiftly dives and breaks the waves in search of prey.<br>&nbsp;<br>Occasionally, the people went hungry, the weather was too rough, or two of the villages would come into conflict; but no matter how he spent his days, everyone was skilled at telling diverse stories of the sea. People told tales at meals, when they met, at rituals, and when making love. They even told them in their sleep. A complete record had never been made, but many years later anthropologists might know that the islanders had the greatest number of sea sagas of any people on Earth. &#x201c;Let me tell you a story of the sea&#x201d; was on the tip of everyone&#x2019;s tongue. They did not ask how old people were, but simply grew tall like trees and stuck out their organs of increase like flowers. Like the obstinate clam they just passed the time. Like a sea turtle each islander died with the curl of a smile at the corner of his mouth. They were all old souls, older than they appeared, and because they spent their lives staring at the sea they all had melancholy miens and tended to get cataracts and go blind in old age. When they were ready to go, old folks would ask the youngsters by the bed, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the weather out at sea like now?&#x201d; People believed that dying while gazing at the sea was the grace of Kabang. Their lifelong dream was to arrive at the moment of death with an image of the ocean in the ocean of the mind.<br>&nbsp;<br>When a boy was born, his father would select a tree for him and carve a notch for each resurrection of the moon. When there were a hundred and eighty notches, the boy had to build a <i>talawaka</i> of his very own. Years before, the anthropologist S. Percy Smith had described the <i>talawaka</i> as a &#x201c;canoe.&#x201d; Actually, it was more like a grass boat. The island was too small to have enough trees with trunks thick enough to be made into canoes. Students of anthropological history smile at Smith&#x2019;s mistake, but nobody would laugh at him, as anyone who saw a<i> talawaka</i> would assume it was a dugout canoe. A <i>talawaka </i>was made by weaving sticks, rattan stems and three or four different kinds of silver grass together to form a frame and applying three coatings of plant pulp. Peat from the bog was used to plug any remaining cracks, and the craft was waterproofed with sap. A finished <i>talawaka</i> really did look like a finely finished canoe made by hollowing out the trunk of a sturdy tree.<br>&nbsp;<br>The finest and sturdiest<i> talawaka</i> on the island was made by a youth named Atile&#x2019;i. Atile&#x2019;i&#x2019;s face had the typical traits of his people: a flat nose, profound eyes, shining skin, a sad, slouching spine and arrow-like limbs.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Atile&#x2019;i, don&#x2019;t sit there, the sea fiends will see you!&#x201d; hollered a passing elder upon seeing Atile&#x2019;i sitting by the shore.<br>&nbsp;<br>###<br>&nbsp;<br>Once, like everyone else, Atile&#x2019;i thought that the whole world was but a single island drifting on the sea like a hollow clamshell in a tub of water.<br>&nbsp;<br>Having learned the art of <i>talawaka </i>construction from his father, Atile&#x2019;i was praised as the most skilled <i>talawaka</i>-maker among the island youth, even more skilled than his elder brother Nale&#x2019;ida. Though young, Atile&#x2019;i had the physique of a fish and could catch three ghostheads on a single breath. Every girl on the island pined for Atile&#x2019;i and hoped that one day he would waylay her, throw her over his shoulder and carry her off into a clump of grass. Three full moons later, she would discreetly inform Atile&#x2019;i that she was with child. Then she would go home, act normal, and wait for Atile&#x2019;i to arrive with a whalebone knife and a marriage proposal. Maybe that&#x2019;s what the most beautiful girl on the island, Rasula, was hoping for, too.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Atile&#x2019;i has the fate of a second son. What good is a second son who can dive? Atile&#x2019;i is destined for the Sea God, not for Wayo Wayo.&#x201d; Atile&#x2019;i&#x2019;s mother often complained in this vein, and people would nod knowingly, understanding that raising an outstanding second son was the most painful thing in the world for any parent. Atile&#x2019;i&#x2019;s mother grumbled day and night, her thick lips trembling, as if the more she bemoaned her son&#x2019;s fate the greater his chance of avoiding it might be.<br>&nbsp;<br>Unless an eldest son died young, the second son seldom married and went on to become an &#x201c;old man of the sea.&#x201d; Upon reaching his one hundred and eightieth full moon, he would be sent out to sea on a mission of no return. He could take no more than ten days&#x2019; worth of water and was not allowed to look back. Hence the saying, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just wait until your second son returns,&#x201d; which simply meant, &#x201c;Perish the thought.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>With flashing eyelashes and sparkling skin, covered in crystals of salt, Atile&#x2019;i looked like the son of the Sea God. Tomorrow he would brave the waves in his <i>talawaka</i>. He climbed the highest reef-rock on the island and gazed down at the distant swells, at the white creases in the fabric of the sea. The seabirds flying along the shore reminded him of Rasula, who was as nimble as the shadow of a bird in flight. And like a shore pounded by the waves for many eons, his heart, he felt, was about to break.<br>&nbsp;<br>According to custom, Atile&#x2019;i&#x2019;s admirers laid ambush at dusk. Atile&#x2019;i had only to wander past a clump of grass and some young maiden would accost him. Every time he hoped the girl in the grass would be Rasula, but Rasula never appeared. Atile&#x2019;i made love over and over again to the girls in the grass, for this was the last chance he had to father a child and leave some small part of himself behind on the island. In fact, as a matter of propriety and morality, he could not refuse their propositions: the girls of Wayo Wayo could ambush a second son on the night before he went to sea. Atile&#x2019;i broke his back making love to the girls in the thickets, taking no pleasure, intent only on nearing Rasula&#x2019;s place before dawn. He had a feeling he would meet her there. Each girl along the way sensed that once inside her Atile&#x2019;i was in a rush to leave. Hurt, they all asked, &#x201c;Atile&#x2019;i, why don&#x2019;t you love me?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You know that people can&#x2019;t pit their hearts against the sea.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Atile&#x2019;i finally made it with pale fishbelly dawn on the horizon. A pair of hands appeared from inside the grass and lightly drew him in. Shivering like a seabird ducking beside a boulder to dodge a flash of lightning, Atile&#x2019;i could barely get an erection, not because he was exhausted but because the look in Rasula&#x2019;s eyes was like a jellyfish&#x2019;s sting.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Atile&#x2019;i, why don&#x2019;t you love me?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Who says I don&#x2019;t love you? But you know no man can pit his heart against the sea.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>They cuddled for a long while. Eyes closed, Atile&#x2019;i felt like he was hanging in thin air, gazing down upon the open ocean. He gradually became aroused, tried to force himself to forget that soon he would go to sea, wanting only to feel the warmth inside Rasula&#x2019;s body. At dawn, the villagers would all go down to the shore to see Atile&#x2019;i off. Except for the Sea Sage and the Earth Sage, nobody would have noticed that all through the night departed spirits of second sons had been coming home. They all wanted to ride with the youth whose skin sparkled like the son of the Sea as he piloted the <i>talawaka</i> he had fashioned himself, carrying a &#x201c;speaking flute,&#x201d; a final gift from Rasula, as he rowed away to the fate he shared with them, each one, the fate of every Wayo Wayoan second son.</p></p><h2>The Trivium in College Composition and Reading</h2><p>2014 Reprint of 1948 Third Edition. Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. The &#34;Trivium&#34; is a systematic method of critical thinking for deriving certainty from any information coming into the mind via the five senses. In medieval universities, the Trivium comprised the three subjects that were taught first, specifically in this order: grammar, logic and rhetoric. While most textbooks are lucky to enjoy a shelf life of three or four years, &#34;The Trivium&#34; followed a different path. In 1947, when Columbia University Press published her celebrated dissertation, &#34;Shakespeare&#39;s Use of the Arts of Language,&#34; Sister Miriam Joseph&#39;s previously published textbook gained wider notice. And since then, The &#34;Trivium&#34; continues to be rediscovered by new generations of writers and teachers. This dense, authoritative textbook takes all of Aristotle&#39;s teachings on logic, grammar, and rhetoric, and some of his teachings of poetics, adds some of the insights gained in the subsequent centuries, and presents it in a well-organized flow.</p><p></p><h2>The Open Conspiracy: What Are We To Do With Our Lives?</h2><p><p>This is a guidebook on world control and management, a program that Wells believed should be orchestrated (and would be successful) through what he called the "Open Conspiracy".

Rob Marshall, a successful insurance broker, was the big breadwinner, king of the country club set. Maria Marshall was his stunningly beautiful wife and the perfect mom to their three great kids.&nbsp;<br><br> Then one night while the couple drove home from Atlantic City, Rob, his head bloodied, reported Maria had been brutally slain. Sympathy poured in&#x2014;until disquieting facts began to surface...and the true story of adultery, gambling, drugs and murder tore the mask off Rob Marshall and the blinders off the town that thought he could do no wrong.</p><p><b>Joe McGinniss </b>is the author of eleven other non-fiction works and one novel.Rob Marshall, member of the country-club set of Toms River, N.J., led a freewheeling life of casino gambling, parties and astronomical debt. But Rob was also a civic leader and family man, so his three teenaged sons couldn't believe it when their father was put on trial for having their mother, Maria, murdered in order to collect $1.5 million in insurance and pursue a sexual affair with a neighbor's wife. This true-crime book is about the three boys' crumbling faith in their smooth-talking, high-flying father; on that level, it is often moving and heart-wrenching. It also concerns a suburban coterie's faith in a you-can-have-anything-you-want philosophy and the social and class tensions within one community. Rob's mistress was a friend of a high-ranking New Jersey political figure; drug dealing, loansharking and conspiracy were elements in the unfolding courtroom drama that McGinniss skillfully re-creates. While the story lacks the inherent sizzle of his Fatal Vision , it is absorbing nonetheless. The case took some bizarre twists, as when the wife of the accused hit-man went to live in the bereaved sons' house.

That was how it would have looked, a vessel dropping out of hyperspace, to those in the arrival zone, had there been any witnesses: nothing there, then something, an instantaneous transition.<br><br>In the bridge sat the ancient yacht&#x2019;s sole occupant, a teenage girl wearing a battered combat vac suit. She looked from sensor to sensor, uncertain and slow because of her unfamiliarity with this model of spacecraft. Too, there was something like shock in her eyes.<br><br>Finally satisfied that no other ship had dropped out of hyperspace nearby, or was likely to creep up on her in this remote location, she sat back in her pilot&#x2019;s seat and tried to get her thoughts in order.<br><br>Her name was Vestara Khai, and she was a Sith of the Lost Tribe. She was a proud Sith, not one to hide under false identities and concealing robes until some decades-long grandiose plan neared completion, and now she had even more reason than usual to swell with pride. Mere hours before, she and her Sith Master, Lady Rhea, had confronted Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker. Lady Rhea and Vestara had fought the galaxy&#x2019;s most experienced, most famous Jedi to a standstill. Vestara had even cut him, a graze to the cheek and chin that had spattered her with blood&#x2014;blood she had later tasted, blood she wished she could take a sample of and keep forever as a souvenir.<br><br>But then Skywalker had shown why he carried that reputation. A moment&#x2019;s distraction, and suddenly Lady Rhea was in four pieces, each drifting in a separate direction, and Vestara was hopelessly outmatched. She had saluted and fled.<br><br>Now, having taken a space yacht that had doubtless been old when her great-great-great-grandsires were newborn, but which, to her everlasting gratitude, held in its still-functional computer the navigational secrets of the mass of black holes that was the Maw, she was free. And the impossible weights of her reality and her responsibility were settling upon her.<br><br>Lady Rhea was dead. Vestara was alone, and her pride at Lady Rhea&#x2019;s accomplishment, at her own near success in the duel with the Jedi, was not enough to wash away the sense of loss.<br><br>Then there was the question of what to do next, of where to go. She needed to be able to communicate with her people, to report on the incidents in the Maw. But this creaking, slowly deteriorating SoroSuub StarTracker space yacht did not carry a hypercomm unit. She&#x2019;d have to put in to some civilized planet to make contact. That meant arriving unseen, or arriving and departing so swiftly that the Jedi could not detect her in time to catch her. It also meant acquiring sufficient credits to fund a secret, no-way-to-trace-it hypercomm message. All of these plans would take time to bring to reality.<br><br>Vestara knew, deep in her heart, and within the warning currents of the Force, that Luke Skywalker intended to track her to her homeworld of Kesh. How he planned to do it, she didn&#x2019;t know, but her sense of paranoia, trained at the hands of Lady Rhea, burned within her as though her blood itself were acid. She had to find some way to outwit a Force-user several times her age, renowned for his skills.<br><br>She needed to go someplace where Force-users were relatively commonplace. Otherwise, any Force use on her part would stand out like signal beacons to experienced Jedi in the vicinity. There weren&#x2019;t many such places. Coruscant was the logical answer. But if her trail began to lead toward the government seat of the Galactic Alliance, Skywalker could warn the Jedi there, and Vestara would face a nearly impossible-to-bypass network of Force-users between her and her destination.<br><br>The current location of the Jedi school was not known. Hapes was ruled by an ex-Jedi and was rumored to harbor more Force-sensitives, but it was such a security-conscious civilization that Vestara doubted she could accomplish her mission there in secrecy.<br><br>Then the answer came to her, so obvious and so perfect that she laughed out loud.<br><br>She doubted the destination she&#x2019;d thought of would be on a galactic map as old as the one in the antique yacht she commanded. She&#x2019;d have to go somewhere and get a map update. She nodded, her pride, sense of loss, and paranoia all fading as she focused on her new task.<br><br>Transitory Mists<br><br>Jedi Knight Leia Organa Solo sat at the Millennium Falcon&#x2019;s communications console. She frowned, her lips pursed, as though she were solving an elaborate mathematical equation, while she read and re-read the text message the Falcon had just received via hypercomm.<br><br>The silence that had settled around her eventually drew her husband, Han Solo, to her side; his boyish, often insensitive persona was in part a fabrication, and he well knew and could sense his wife&#x2019;s moods. The chill and silence of her complete concentration usually meant trouble. He waved a hand between her eyes and the console monitor. &#x201c;Hey.&#x201d;<br><br>She barely reacted to his presence. &#x201c;Hm.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;New message?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;From Ben.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Another letter filled with teenage talk, I assume. Girls, speeders, allowance woes&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Leia ignored his joking. &#x201c;Sith,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;And Sith, of course.&#x201d; Han sat in the chair next to hers but did not assume his customary slouch; the news kept his spine rigid. &#x201c;They found a new Sith Lord?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Worse, I think.&#x201d; Finally some animation returned to Leia&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve found an ancient installation at the Maw and were attacked by a gang of Sith. A whole strike team. With the possibility of more out there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought Sith ran in packs of two. Vape both of &#x2019;em and their menace is ended for all time, at least for a few years, until two more show up.&#x201d; Han tried to keep his voice calm, but the last Sith to bring trouble to the galaxy had been Jacen Solo, his and Leia&#x2019;s eldest son. Though Jacen had been dead for close to three years, the ripples of the evil he had done were still causing damage and heartache throughout the settled galaxy. And both his acts and his death had torn a hole in Han&#x2019;s heart that felt like it would last forever.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, well, no. Apparently not anymore. Ben also says&#x2014;and we&#x2019;re not to let Luke know that he did&#x2014;that Luke is exhausted. Really exhausted, like he&#x2019;s had the life squeezed out of him. Ben would like us to sort of drift near and lend Luke some support.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; But then Han grimaced. &#x201c;Back to the Maw. The only place gloomy enough to make its next door neighbor, Kessel, seem like a garden spot.&#x201d;<br><br>Leia shook her head. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re tracking a Sith girl who&#x2019;s on the run. So it probably won&#x2019;t be the Maw.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, good.&#x201d; Han rubbed his hands together as if anticipating a fine meal or a fight. &#x201c;Why not? After taking off with all those barvy Jedi that Daala wanted to deep-freeze, we probably have an arrest warrant waiting back on Coruscant anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>Finally Leia smiled and looked at Han. &#x201c;One good thing about the Solos and Skywalkers. We never run out of things to do.&#x201d;<br><br>Jedi Temple, Coruscant<br><br>Master Cilghal, Mon Calamari and most proficient medical doctor among the current generation of Jedi, paused before hitting the console button that would erase the message she had just spent some time decrypting. It had been a video transmission from Ben Skywalker, a message carefully rerouted through several hypercomm nodes and carefully staged so as not to mention that it was for Cilghal&#x2019;s tympanic membranes or, in fact, for anyone on Coruscant.<br><br>But its main content was meant for the Jedi, and Cilghal repeated it as a one-word summation, making the word sound like a vicious curse: &#x201c;Sith.&#x201d;<br><br>The message had to be communicated throughout the Jedi Order. And on review, there was nothing in it that suggested she couldn&#x2019;t preserve the recording, couldn&#x2019;t claim that it had been forwarded to her by a civilian friend of the Skywalkers. Luke Skywalker was not supposed to be in contact with the Jedi Temple, but this recording was manifestly free of any proof that the exiled Grand Master exerted any influence over the Order. She could distribute it.<br><br>And she would do so, right now.<br><br>Deep Space Near Kessel<br><br>Jade Shadow, onetime vehicle of Mara Jade Skywalker, now full-time transport and home to her widower and son, dropped from hyperspace into the empty blackness well outside the Kessel system. She hung suspended there for several minutes, long enough for one of her occupants to gather from the Force a sense of his own life&#x2019;s blood that had been in the vicinity; then she turned on a course toward Kessel and vanished again into hyperspace.<br><br>Jade Shadow, In Orbit Above Kessel<br><br>Ben Skywalker shouldered his way through the narrow hatch that gave access to his father&#x2019;s cabin. The auburn-haired teen was a little shorter than average height, but he was well muscled in a way that his anonymous tunic and pants could not conceal.<br><br>On the cabin&#x2019;s bed, under a brown blanket, lay Luke Skywalker. Similar in build to his son, he wore the evidence of many more years of hard living, including old, faded scars on his face and the exposed portions of his arms. Not obvious was the fact that his right hand, so ordinary in appearance, was a prosthetic.<br><br>Luke&#x2019;s eyes were closed, but he stirred. &#x201c;What did you find out?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I reached Nien Nunb.&#x201d; Nunb, the Sullustan co-owner and manager of one of Kessel&#x2019;s most prominent mineworks, had been a friend of the Solos and Skywalkers for decades. &#x201c;That yacht did make planetfall. The pilot gave her name as Captain Khai. She somehow scammed a port worker into thinking she&#x2019;d paid for a complete refueling when she hadn&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Luke smiled. &#x201c;&#x2018;The Force can have a&#x2014;&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, so can a good-looking girl. Anyway, what&#x2019;s interesting is that she got a galactic map update. Nunb looked at the transmission time and determined that the download was pretty comprehensive. In other words, she didn&#x2019;t concentrate on any one specific area or route. No help there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But it suggests that she did need some of the newer information. New hyperspace routes or planetary listings.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And she&#x2019;s gone?&#x201d; Luke asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Headed out as soon as her yacht was refueled. By the way, its name is She&#x2019;s a Chancer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Somehow appropriate.&#x201d; Finally, Luke did open his eyes, and Ben was once again struck by how tired his father looked, tired to the bone and to the spirit. &#x201c;I can still feel her path. I&#x2019;ll be up in a minute to lay in a course.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right. Don&#x2019;t push yourself.&#x201d; Ben backed out of the cabin, and its door slid shut.</p><h2>The Devil in Silver: A Novel</h2><p><b><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY</b><br> <b><i>The New York Times Book Review � The Washington Post � Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>New Hyde Hospital&#x2019;s psychiatric ward has a new resident. It also has a very, <i>very</i> old one.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Pepper is a rambunctious big man, minor-league troublemaker, working-class hero (in his own mind), and, suddenly, the surprised inmate of a budget-strapped mental institution in Queens, New York. He&#x2019;s not mentally ill, but that doesn&#x2019;t seem to matter. He is accused of a crime he can&#x2019;t quite square with his memory. In the darkness of his room on his first night, he&#x2019;s visited by a terrifying creature with the body of an old man and the head of a bison who nearly kills him before being hustled away by the hospital staff. It&#x2019;s no delusion: The other patients confirm that a hungry devil roams the hallways when the sun goes down. Pepper rallies three other inmates in a plot to fight back: Dorry, an octogenarian schizophrenic who&#x2019;s been on the ward for decades and knows all its secrets; Coffee, an African immigrant with severe OCD, who tries desperately to send alarms to the outside world; and Loochie, a bipolar teenage girl who acts as the group&#x2019;s enforcer. Battling the pill-pushing staff, one another, and their own minds, they try to kill the monster that&#x2019;s stalking them. But can the Devil die?<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Devil in Silver</i> brilliantly brings together the compelling themes that spark all of Victor LaValle&#x2019;s radiant fiction: faith, race, class, madness, and our relationship with the unseen and the uncanny. More than that, it&#x2019;s a thrillingly suspenseful work of literary horror about friendship, love, and the courage to slay our own demons.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Devil in Silver</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A <b>fearless</b> exploration of America&#x2019;s heart of darkness . . . a dizzying high-wire act.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;LaValle never writes the same book and his recent is <b>a stunner</b>. . . .

A <b>striking</b> and <b>original</b> American novelist.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New Republic</i></p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Victor LaValle</b></p> <p><strong>Q. <em>The Devil in Silver </em>is a haunting novel about a man named Pepper who is mistakenly committed to a mental hospital in Queens, and the saga of his attempts to escape. What inspired such an idea?</strong></p> <p>A. This book began with a personal incident. Ten years ago someone close to me was committed to a mental hospital in New York. (I'm keeping things vague to protect his anonymity.) On my first visit I found him tied to his bed with restraints. The staff assured me he'd be released soon. On my second visit he was in restraints again. On my third visit, when we were alone, I asked when they took him out of those restraints. He looked exhausted. He said, "They don't."</p> <p>The plot lines and characters didn't come to me until 2010 but the seed of this novel was planted that day.</p> <p><strong>Q. Gary Shteyngart has called you the "new master" of "literary horror." What is literary horror</strong>?</p> <p>A. It's a genre full of scares but one where the characters are more important than the gore. The Devil of my title is vitally important, but the people you meet inside the hospital are the novel's true concern. Shirley Jackson has been a real inspiration in this vein because she balanced external horrors and psychological depth with perfection.</p> <p>I happen to be a lifelong fan of horror movies. In certain kinds of horror films the cast is really just meat meant to be chopped up by the monster. In those flicks, fun as they are, the characters are interchangeable and their deaths rarely mean much. But in another kind of horror film the trials characters face, their deaths, do mean something. We care about them and this makes their fates more frightening. <em>The Devil in Silver</em> is a story like that.</p> <p><strong>Q. Are you thinking of any movies, in particular, that might have the same tone?</strong></p> <p>A. For sure. Roman Polanski's <em>Rosemary's Baby</em> is a classic film and seems like "literary horror" to me. That movie is about a woman who is tricked into bearing a baby for the Devil, but really it's a series of frightening portraits: Of New York City in the late-sixties; of the state of being newly married to someone you can't trust; of the wild New York characters living in one building; and even of the spooky building itself, the vast and haunting Dakota. Trapped within all these circles of strangeness is one sane character, Rosemary. That movie isn't chilling because of the scene where an actor wearing furry gloves climbs on top of Mia Farrow. Instead, it's a great work of horror because we care about Rosemary and want her to be safe despite all the forces allied against her. It's the same for Pepper, and for all the other characters in <em>The Devil in Silver</em>. We want them to be safe. We want them to survive. The horror seeps in as we recognize that not all of them will.</p>"The novel<b>,&nbsp;EXPERTLY WRITTEN,</b>&nbsp;will leave you wondering about its many memorable characters and lingering over questions about fear, horror, madness, suffering, friendship, and love." -<i>Publishers Weekly, <b>PW's TOP TEN FICTION FOR THE FALL 2012.</b></i></p><h2>Return of the Buffaloes, The: A Plains Indian Story about Famine and Renewal of the Earth</h2><p>The Return of the Buffaloes celebrates the close, mystical relationship between the Lakota people and the buffalo.</p><p><b>Paul Goble</b> (1933&#x2013;2017) was an English author and illustrator of more than 30 children&#x2019;s books. Inspired by Plains Indian culture, he was best known for writing stories about Native Americans, including <i>The Legend of the White Buffalo Woman</i>,<i> The Return of the Buffaloes</i>, and the Caldecott Medal&#x2013;winning<i> The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses</i>.Ages 5^-8. Goble, whose picture books include <i>Buffalo Woman</i> (1984), retells another tale about the mysterious woman whose people are the buffalo. In this Lakota myth, spring arrives, but the buffalo do not return. The hunters come back empty-handed from each search, until two young brothers go out and find Buffalo Woman, who promises to send her people to the plains again. The buffalo herds soon thunder around the tepees of the hungry people, who give thanks to the mysterious woman. Goble's artwork shows his delight in color, pattern, silhouette, and Native American motifs. Besides the large paintings on the double-page spreads, he includes small geometric designs copied from traditional parfleches (rawhide pouches) of the Lakota, the Arapaho, and the Cheyenne. Two introductory pages concern parfleches (which appear in the story), including a page to photocopy, paint, cut, and fold into a model parfleche, a project that children and teachers may find worthwhile. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>Ephesians</h2><p>A compelling commentary that presents the depth and clarity of Paul&#39;s letter to the Ephesians.</p><p>According to James Montgomery Boice, Paul's great letter to the Ephesians is "a mini-course in theology, centered on the church." Writing to the church in a city much like modern-day New York, Paul laid out his mature vision of the Christian faith's central elements. The apostle set these fundamental doctrines in the context of the church as the body of Christ.<br><br>In this compelling commentary, Boice presents the message of Paul with great depth and clarity. The author proclaims the profound yet simple gospel once delivered to the church in Ephesus and effectively applies it to the modern church. <br><br>Writes Boice: "There is no denying that Ephesians is deeply appealing, perhaps precisely because . . . it presents the basic doctrines of Christianity comprehensively, clearly, practically, and winsomely."

He always had trouble tying a jeweled belt, but his fingers seemed more trembly this morning. Was he nervous too?</p><p>I set aside my mirror and crossed the bedchamber, nudging his hands aside. &#x201c;Let me do it.&#x201d; Though both his hands and mine were spotted with age and lined with bulging blue veins, at least mine were still nimble.</p><p>He cradled my head and placed a kiss on my forehead. &#x201c;Thank you, love. What would I do without you?&#x201d;</p><p>I finished the knot and gazed into his rheumy eyes, as smitten as I&#x2019;d been sixty-six years ago. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hope you never find out.&#x201d; I laced my arm through his. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go downstairs. The children are waiting.&#x201d;</p><p>He opened our chamber door, and lively family sounds floated up from the courtyard below. We descended the stairs slowly since Daniel&#x2019;s feet pained him. Waiting in our lush green courtyard were three generations of our descendants seated around four long rectangular tables. Four daughters with their husbands. Twenty-one grandchildren. And thirty-two greats.</p><p>Two conscientious grandsons met their <i>saba </i>Daniel at the bottom of the steps, one supporting each elbow. I was left to follow&#x2014;alone. The snubbing had begun.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; he protested. &#x201c;Tend to your <i>savta</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But <i>Ima </i>said your feet have been paining you, Saba.&#x201d; Our oldest daughter&#x2019;s firstborn offered an obligatory nod at me. &#x201c;<i>Shalom</i>, Savta.&#x201d;</p><p>I returned the nod with a half smile but remained silent, refusing to mock the peace such a greeting offered. One glance at our oldest daughter, Kezia, assured me there would be no shalom today. She stole sullen glimpses at me while standing beside her husband, Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah&#x2019;s exiles in Babylon. Our other three daughters stood arm in arm with their husbands, eyes trained on the abba they all adored.</p><p>&#x201c;Abba and Ima!&#x201d; Sheshbazzar, whom we lovingly called Shesh, shouted over the dull roar of chattering children and our fountain&#x2019;s happy splashing. &#x201c;Take your place at the head of the table.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d already arranged two brightly colored cushions at the end nearest the stairs and rushed over to support Daniel&#x2019;s arm while he lowered himself. I mouthed a silent thank-you and sat quietly beside my husband.</p><p>Shesh took his place at Daniel&#x2019;s right. Kezia sat beside her husband with several of her children and grandchildren filling spaces at the large table around us. She avoided my gaze.</p><p>&#x201c;You look lovely today, Kezia.&#x201d; I spoke across Daniel. &#x201c;Is that a new robe, dear?&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes sparked. &#x201c;Are you implying I spend too much money at the market, Ima?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, dear. I...&#x201d; Nothing I said to Kezia would be safe. &#x201c;You are beautiful, Daughter. That&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;</p><p>Her cheeks pinked, and she looked quickly away, beginning a conversation with one of her daughters about the toddler on her lap. A great-grandson I&#x2019;d met only a few times. Kezia&#x2019;s eyes crinkled with a smile that lit her features. She was a good ima, at her best when her children surrounded her. Had she learned anything from me&#x2014;before her hatred sprouted and grew?</p><p>The servants began a triumphant march with pitchers of juice and wine and platters laden with various meats, fruits, and vegetables. This was a day our dear Egyptian servant, Mert, anticipated all year long, a day when her best recipes from both Babylon and Jerusalem found their way to our table.</p><p>My husband hoisted his silver chalice in the air, repeating his annual vow. &#x201c;If I forget you, Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill. May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if I do not consider Jerusalem my highest joy.&#x201d; Adults lifted goblets of wine and children their cups of juice. Our children had seen Jerusalem only in their minds through the stories Daniel told of his childhood in the palace. The rugged beauty of Zion. The grandeur of Yahweh&#x2019;s Temple.</p><p>With our first sip came the rattle of the courtyard gate, and I caught the glint of morning sun off a soldier&#x2019;s shield. Ten of King Belshazzar&#x2019;s guards charged into our celebration.</p><p>One, wearing a captain&#x2019;s gold breastplate, marched straight toward my husband. &#x201c;King Belshazzar commands the presence of Daniel, exile of Judah, chief of King Nebuchadnezzar&#x2019;s counselors.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am Daniel.&#x201d; He stood, and the captain gripped his arm and fairly dragged him toward the gate.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; I lunged for my husband, but the other soldiers blocked my way.</p><p>My Daniel looked over his shoulder, offering a weak smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back, love. Save some roast lamb for me.&#x201d;</p><p>Panic clawed at my throat while ten strong soldiers led away the beating of my heart. I turned to the fruit of my womb, who moments ago had shunned me. Now everyone stared at me, pleading silently for direction. Angst filled my belly. Who needed food when my Daniel had been taken to the banquet of a madman? &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going upstairs to pray. No one eats a bite until Daniel returns.&#x201d;</p><p>***</p><p>The captain&#x2019;s fingers bit into Daniel&#x2019;s arm, pulling him into the narrow street. Daniel tried to hurry his pace, but his feet were too tender. Perhaps conversation would slow the man down. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t visited the palace since Nebuchadnezzar released me from service twenty-four years ago. Did King Belshazzar mention his reason for summoning me?&#x201d;</p><p>The only sound came from rippling water in the canal alongside the street. Silence was typical of a loyal eunuch. The captain&#x2019;s wide gold collar proclaimed his vow to serve the king unto death and the king&#x2019;s reciprocal commitment to lifelong provision.</p><p>Daniel stumbled, landing hard on his right foot. He braced his hands against his knees, wincing in pain.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you well?&#x201d; The captain&#x2019;s concern was rather surprising.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, thank you. Could we slow our pace a bit?&#x201d; Before the eunuch could answer, his stomach growled, and Daniel chuckled. &#x201c;You and your men should have joined us for this morning&#x2019;s meal. Mert is a fine cook.&#x201d;</p><p>The captain&#x2019;s features remained grim. &#x201c;The king needs you now, Lord Daniel. Please.&#x201d; He extended his hand in the direction of the palace, and Daniel felt the prickly flesh of urgency.</p><p>Continuing in silence, they left the walled city of Babylon&#x2019;s wealth and noblility and ascended the marble stairs to the Processional Way. While crossing the wide avenue splitting Babylon&#x2019;s municipality, they passed the three-storied Ishtar Gate, the military complex, and finally entered palace grounds through its southern gate.</p><p>The pounding of drums and trill of a flute floated on a chill autumn breeze, and a sudden presence pressed Daniel to his knees. With both hands over his ears, he blocked out distraction and held in the silent whisper:</p><p>&#x201c;<i>MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN</i>.</p><p><i>Mene</i>: I have numbered the days of Belshazzar&#x2019;s reign and brought it to an end.</p><p><i>Tekel</i>: He has been weighed on My scales and found wanting.</p><p><i>Parsin</i>: I have divided his kingdom and given it to the Medes and Persians.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My lord!&#x201d; A huge hand lifted Daniel to his feet. &#x201c;My lord, are you well?&#x201d;</p><p>Shadows cleared from the prophet&#x2019;s eyes, and he gazed into ten pale faces. &#x201c;Yes, yes. Thank you. We must hurry to the king.&#x201d;</p><p>The captain placed a giant arm around Daniel&#x2019;s waist and fairly carried him toward the grand stairway. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard you are a seer. Did you have a vision, my lord?&#x201d;</p><p>Daniel sensed something genuine in this man but knew a eunuch&#x2019;s loyalty was first and always to his king. &#x201c;If you have any family in Babylon, Captain, they should leave the city tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>His brows shot up, but a slight nod communicated understanding. Any Babylonian with a measure of sense knew King Cyrus of Persia had built an army that would someday overtake Babylon&#x2014;the empire King Belshazzar had weakened by overspending, poor council choices, and constant revelry during the past fourteen years.</p><p>The captain hoisted Daniel up the grand stairway and into the main entrance. They hurried through what had once been pristine hallways, now covered in dust and frayed tapestries. Music grew louder as they neared the throne hall but with no accompanying sounds of laughter or merriment.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought the king was hosting a banquet,&#x201d; Daniel said.</p><p>&#x201c;He was.&#x201d; Was it fear or loyalty that kept him from saying more? Guards at the throne room opened the double doors, revealing the colossal space filled with tables, terrified noblemen, and musicians whose timid notes tested the eerie silence.</p><p>A man wearing a gold crown rushed toward Daniel. He&#x2019;d seen the young king only once, on the day of his coronation, when Belshazzar entered Babylon in a chariot on the Processional Way. He was much shorter up close and much older tonight.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you Daniel, one of the exiles my great-grandfather brought from Judah?&#x201d;</p><p>Daniel barely had time for a nod before the king aimed a shaking finger at a side wall. &#x201c;The inscription. See it? None of my wise men could interpret it.&#x201d;</p><p>Daniel followed his gesture and stared at the exact words from his vision blazing with an unnatural fire on the plastered wall. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard the spirit of the gods lives in you,&#x201d; the king said, his panic-stricken features but a handbreadth away. &#x201c;Interpret the message, and I swear by my father&#x2019;s life I&#x2019;ll dress you in purple, place a gold chain around your neck, and make you the third highest ruler in our kingdom.&#x201d;</p><p>Sickened by the king&#x2019;s stale sweat and fetid breath, Daniel was grateful he hadn&#x2019;t eaten. How many promises had this regent broken? Many believed Belshazzar had killed his father to take Babylon&#x2019;s throne. Shrugging off Belshazzar&#x2019;s hands, Daniel stepped back and bowed with forced habit.</p><p>&#x201c;You may keep your gifts and reward someone else. The Most High God gives glory and splendor to whomever He pleases&#x2014;as He did to your forefather King Nebuchadnezzar. But when the king became proud, he was stripped of his glory, driven away from people, and given the mind of an animal. He lived with wild donkeys and ate grass like the ox until he acknowledged that the Most High God is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and sets over them anyone He wishes. But you, Belshazzar, though you knew all this, have not humbled yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>Shocked whispers rolled like a tide over the noblemen in the hall, confirming that King Nebuchadnezzar&#x2019;s transformation had not been widely known. Daniel scanned the crowd, noticing for the first time the glint of gold set before each guest.</p><p>Righteous indignation loosed his tongue again. &#x201c;You set yourself against the Lord of heaven by allowing your nobles, wives, and concubines to drink wine from the goblets taken from Yahweh&#x2019;s Temple. You have not honored the God who holds your life in His hands, so His hand wrote your doom on the wall.&#x201d;</p><p>Daniel pointed to the blazing words and read aloud:</p><p><i>&#x201c;MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN. The Lord has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end. You have been weighed on scales and found wanting. Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.&#x201d;</i></p><p>He bowed once more and turned to go.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; Belshazzar grabbed his arm and then lowered himself to one knee, inclining his head. &#x201c;Please. I believe everything you&#x2019;ve said, but please have mercy.&#x201d; He stood and lifted his voice to the gathering. &#x201c;Daniel will wear a purple robe from my chamber, and only my commands and those of my father carry more authority than Daniel&#x2019;s in the whole empire.&#x201d;</p><p>Belshazzar removed the gold chain from his neck and lifted it over Daniel&#x2019;s head, letting the chiseled granite seal rest on the prophet&#x2019;s chest. Lingering near, he spoke in a voice meant for only the prophet. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re now a son of Babylon. Surely your god won&#x2019;t destroy an empire governed by one of his own.&#x201d;</p><p>Daniel answered in an equally quiet voice. &#x201c;My God will destroy many empires to bless His own.&#x201d;</p><p>King Belshazzar recoiled, stiffened, and studied him. &#x201c;You will remain at my side until I&#x2019;m convinced you haven&#x2019;t somehow conspired against me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As you wish.&#x201d; Daniel followed him to the elevated table, eating food prepared by palace cooks instead of the meal made by Mert&#x2019;s loving hands.</p><p><i>Yahweh, protect my family when You bring Cyrus into Babylon.</i></p></p><h2>Better Buses, Better Cities: How to Plan, Run, and Win the Fight for Effective Transit</h2><p><b>"<i>Better Buses, Better Cities</i>&nbsp;is likely the best book ever written on improving bus service in the United States."&nbsp;&#x2014; Randy Shaw,&nbsp;<i>Beyond Chron</i><br> "The ultimate roadmap for how to make the bus great again in your city."<i> &#x2014; Spacing</i></b><br><br> Imagine a bus system that is fast, frequent, and reliable&#x2014;what would that change about your city?<br><br> Buses can and should be the cornerstone of urban transportation.

With a compelling narrative and actionable steps, <i>Better Buses, Better Cities</i> inspires us to fix the bus.<br><br> Transit expert Steven Higashide shows us what a successful bus system looks like with real-world stories of reform&#x2014;such as Houston redrawing its bus network overnight, Boston making room on its streets to put buses first, and Indianapolis winning better bus service on Election Day. Higashide shows how to marshal the public in support of better buses and how new technologies can keep buses on time and make complex transit systems understandable.<br><br> Higashide argues that better bus systems will create better cities for all citizens. The consequences of subpar transit service fall most heavily on vulnerable members of society. Transit systems should be planned to be inclusive and provide better service for all. These are difficult tasks that require institutional culture shifts; doing all of them requires resilient organizations and transformational leadership.<br><br> Better bus service is key to making our cities better for all citizens. <i>Better Buses, Better Cities</i> describes how decision-makers, philanthropists, activists, and public agency leaders can work together to make the bus a win in any city.</p><p><p>Imagine a bus system that is fast, frequent, and reliable&#x2014;what would that change about your city?</p>Steven Higashide is one of America&#x2019;s leading experts on public transportation and the people who use it.

It is packed with plenty of NEW, useful and easy-to- understand information about Lyme, its coinfections and various co-conditions. For this book, Connie interviewed ten leading Lyme specialists, including one from Germany, one from Canada and eight from the USA &#x2013;all of which have an integrative approach to treatment. The experts all agree that certain treatment steps are essential for recovery, but all have a unique treatment approach and provide their own pearls of wisdom. I congratulate Connie for a job VERY well done!" W. Lee Cowden, MD, MD(H) Chairman, Scientific Advisory Board Academy of Comprehensive Integrative Medicine Recent years have brought dramatic changes in how top doctors are treating Lyme disease. New paradigms in Lyme disease treatment have emerged and are helping people to recover, even those that have failed years of treatments. This book is based on interviews with ten leading Lyme doctors, and takes you deep into their treatment programs, so you can see for yourself what is new and different about modern Lyme treatment. No matter how many Lyme disease books you've already read, you don't want to miss the new treatment strategies presented in this book. Writer Connie Strasheim is no stranger to interviewing Lyme disease doctors. This is the second doctor interview book she has written on the topic of treating Lyme disease. Her first, entitled Insights Into Lyme Disease Treatment, has sold more than 15,000 copies and was based on interviews with over a dozen Lyme-treating physicians. Connie's experience in health care journalism (with a specific focus on Lyme disease) has allowed her to become an expert in extracting only the most important information from busy doctors who have a treasure vault of Lyme treatment wisdom stored in their brains. In her interviews with the doctors, Connie asks a broad array of questions designed to bring you the most cutting-edge, practical, and useful information possible. The Internet age has ushered in a near-infinite number of ways to research Lyme disease. But wisdom on the best way to successfully overcome Lyme disease isn't found in a Google search, but instead, is contained within the minds of doctors who treat this disease day-in and day-out, and who have experience treating thousands of patients. Traveling to have appointments with each of the doctors interviewed in this book would take weeks, and cost thousands of dollars.

I simply could not put it down. If only I had had this book 20 years ago, it would have saved me so much time and money. The collection of interviews is like finding a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. The book provides very specific and powerful treatment approaches to Lyme and is a comprehensive collection of the latest and greatest integrative treatment options from several of my heroes in the treatment of Lyme disease. One of the things that I really like about the book is that it goes beyond what we normally think of as &#34;Lyme disease&#34; treatments and looks at the many factors that have to be considered to regain optimal health. These include mold illness, environmental toxicity, electromagnetic pollution, parasites, emotional healing, dental issues, methylation, SIBO, hormones, and much more. The comprehensive list of treatment options includes things such as coffee enemas, ozone therapies, low-dose immunotherapy; vasoactive intestinal peptide, bio-magnetic and herbal treatments; antibiotics, low-dose naltrexone, pulsed electromagnetic field therapy, ionic foot baths, and much more. It opens your eyes to the many powerful tools that we have available to regain our health. It is a comprehensive resource that will change the way that you think about recovering from Lyme disease and make you feel more empowered to obtain wellness.

Join Charlie and Mouse as they talk to lumps, take the neighborhood to a party, sell some rocks, and invent the bedtime banana. With imagination and humor, Laurel Snyder and Emily Hughes paint a lively picture of brotherhood that children will relish in a beginning chapter book format; making this a perfect book for young readers graduating from picture books.</p><p>Laurel Snyder is the author of many books for children. She lives and writes in a small yellow house in Atlanta, Georgia, which she shares with her husband and two sons.<br><br>Emily Hughes is an illustrator (and sometimes writer) who lives in windy Brighton, England.K-Gr 2&#x2014;This early reader series opener offers likable characters but an underdeveloped story. Charlie and Mouse are brothers with loving parents and a diverse group of friends and neighbors. They take part in simple childhood pastimes: a neighborhood party, a money-making plan, a bedtime snack. They do everything together, from the moment they wake up in the morning until they go to sleep in the same bed at night. Snyder infuses each tale with humor, and young readers will enjoy illustrator Hughes's depictions of each character, especially the facial expressions. Repetitive language supports emergent readers looking to try chapter books. However, the first two chapters fly by without giving readers the opportunity to get to know the characters better. Early events don't always make sense; for example, there's no clear reason why the characters have a neighborhood party, and it seems anticlimactic. Charlie and Mouse appear to get along exceptionally well for two young siblings, which doesn't feel particularly realistic. The last two chapters are much more fleshed out, and readers who have taken to Charlie and Mouse will most certainly look forward to the next book in the series. VERDICT Early reader collections will benefit from this new series, especially if future volumes incorporate stronger storytelling.&#x2014;Casey O'Leary, Mooresville Public Library, IN</p><h2>Martha Stewart&#39;s Cupcakes: 175 Inspired Ideas for Everyone&#39;s Favorite Treat: A Baking Book</h2><p>They are the star attraction for special days, such as birthdays and holidays, as well as perfect everyday goodies.

The fruit, which is actually a lemon-orange hybrid, is generally available at specialty stores in winter and early spring. If you can&#x2019;t find Meyer lemons, use regular lemons instead. The recipe yields a lot of cupcakes, so you may want to consider these for a bake sale or large gathering, such as a shower or special birthday celebration. <br> <p><b>Cupcake Ingredients</b></p> <ul> <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted</li> <li>2 tablespoons finely grated Meyer lemon zest, plus 2 tablespoons fresh Meyer lemon juice (from 1 to 2 Meyer lemons)</li> <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li> <li>1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt</li> <li>1 3/4 cups (3 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature</li> <li>3 cups granulated sugar</li> <li>8 ounces cream cheese, room temperature</li> <li>7 large eggs, room temperature</li> <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li> <li>Confectioners&#x2019; sugar, for dusting</li> <li>Lemon Curd (made with Meyer lemons; ingredients and directions below)</li> </ul> <p>(Makes 42)</p> <p><b>Directions</b></p> 1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line standard muffin tins with paper liners. Whisk together flour, zest, baking powder, and salt.<p></p> <p>2. With an electric mixer on medium-high speed, cream butter and granulated sugar until pale and fluffy. Beat in cream cheese. Reduce speed to low. Add eggs, one at a time, beating until each is incorporated, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Beat in lemon juice and vanilla. Add flour mixture in three batches, beating until just combined after each. </p> <p>3. Divide batter evenly among lined cups, filling each three-quarters full. Bake, rotating tins halfway through, until a cake tester inserted in centers comes out clean, about 28 minutes. Transfer tins to wire racks to cool completely before removing cupcakes. Cupcakes can be stored overnight at room temperature, or frozen up to 2 months, in airtight containers.</p> <p>4. To finish, dust cupcakes with confectioners&#x2019; sugar. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a coupler and a medium round tip (#8) with curd. Insert tip into top of each cupcake, and squeeze some curd below top to fill the inside, then lift the tip and squeeze more curd in a pool on top. Filled cupcakes can be kept at room temperature up to 1 hour (or refrigerated a few hours more) before serving.</p> <p><b>Lemon Curd</b><br> A high proportion of lemon juice gives curd its intense flavor. As an acid, the juice also prevents the yolks from curdling when heated (unlike when making pastry cream, which requires the extra step of tempering). You can substitute an equal amount of juice from other citrus, such as lime, grapefruit, or blood orange.</p><p> </p><p><b>Lemon Curd Ingredients</b></p> <ul> <li>2 whole eggs plus 8 egg yolks</li> <li>1 cup sugar</li> <li>2/3 cup fresh lemon juice (about 6 lemons)</li> <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, room temperature</li> </ul> <p>(Makes about 2 cups)</p> <p><b>Directions</b></p> 1. Combine whole eggs and yolks, sugar, and lemon juice in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Cook, whisking constantly, until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from heat. Add butter, a few pieces at a time, whisking until smooth after each addition. Strain through a fine sieve into another bowl, and cover with parchment paper or plastic wrap, pressing it directly on surface to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until chilled and firm, at least 2 hours (or up to 2 days).</i>MARTHA STEWART LIVING magazine was first published in 1990.

Secular values beckon us to adopt the world's way of thinking linked to most everything we do, and often we conform to cultural norms without even knowing it. There is the continual push for higher and greater results. When we idolize results that we think please Him, we actually fail to exhibit the obedience He asks of us. </p><p> </p><p>So what should ministry look like? Jesus instructs us to follow Him. When we do we find ten characteristics from Christ�s earthly ministry that are also evident in the early church. We call this the kingdom path. This book points the way and invites each and every reader to make the choice to take it. </p><p> </p><p>If this sounds oversimplified to you, candidly, we think we are the ones who have complicated things. Remember, Jesus recruited ordinary, mostly uneducated people and gave them basic instructions. He used words like "follow," "trust," and "obey." Are we following His clear instructions? When we pursue the kingdom path, then fruitfulness, or kingdom outcomes, are the by-product. The kingdom path is the only path that leads to kingdom outcomes. </p><p> </p><p>For bulk orders, please call ECFA at 540-535-0103.</p><p></p></p><p><p><b>Gary G. Hoag </b></p><p> </p><p>Gary G.

The book starts strong, with excellent observations that distinguish between the world's view of success and what the Bible and the life of Christ have to say. Then, it gets stronger with so many profound questions and practical ways to move toward the viewpoint of Scripture. Honestly, this book describes the way I know I should lead and the way that I want to lead, but too often don t lead. However, I didn't feel like the book was beating me up, I felt like it was lifting me up and encouraging me to press on, seek true success and lead well. I so concur with the book s viewpoint that unexamined presuppositions drive everything we, as leaders do. The myriad of voices in our culture drive us to almost instinctively measure success by more instead of by flourishing biblically. The ten marks of Christ-centered ministry are clear, practical and convicting. This isn't a book that I will just read; it is a book that I can use to help me be a more Christ-centered leader.</i> --David Wills, President, National Christian Foundation<br><br><i>The Choice belongs on the reading list of every Christian leader.

The RMN has withdrawn from the Silesian Confederacy in an effort to focus on its war with the People's Republic of Haven and the shipping cartels have been losing vessels: cargo, crews and all. Klaus Hauptmann sees a glorious opportunity: invite Honor to command the Q-ships which will draw pirate and privateer fire. If she dies, great; if she succeeds, even better. <p> Honor and her companion Nimitz find unexpected friends (and enemies) along the way, and fans of this series' space battles will not be disappointed. In addition to a better glimpse of the Silesian systems, we finally get to meet a few of the Andermani. </p><p> Want to read more about Honor? Read about Honor's early career in On Basilisk Station, her first encounter with the Graysons in The Honor of the Queen, the beginning of the war with the Peeps in The Short, Victorious War, the continuing story of treachery at home in Field of Dishonor, and her ignominous exile (or training to be an Admiral?) in Flag in Exile.</p>HEADS WE WIN TAILS YOU DIE<p>For Captain Honor Harrington, it's sometimes hard to know who the enemy really is. Despite political foes, professional jealousies, and the scandal which drove her into exile, she's been offered a chance to reclaim her career as an officer of the Royal Manticoran Navy. But there's a catch. She must assume command of a "squadron" of jury-rigged armed merchantmen with crew drawn from the dregs of her service and somehow stop the pirates who have taken advantage of the Havenite War to plunder the Star Kingdom's commerce.</p><p>That would be hard enough, but some of the "pirates" aren't exactly what they seem...and neither are some of her "friends". For Honor has been carefully chosen for her mission -- by two implacable and powerful enemies.</p><p>The way they see it, either she stops the raiders or the raiders kill her...and either way, they win.</p></p><h2>Victorian Wooden and Brick Houses with Details (Dover Architecture)</h2><p>This vintage volume offers a treasure trove of floor plans, elevations, and details of residences and public buildings.

These American poems are both elegy and jive, joke and declaration, songs of congregation and self-conception. They connect themes of loneliness, displacement, grief, ancestral trauma, and objectification, while exploring and troubling tropes and stereotypes of Black Americans. Focused primarily on depictions of black womanhood alongside personal narratives, the collection tackles interior and exterior politics&#x2015;of both the body and society, of both the individual and the collective experience. In <em>Magical Negro</em>, Parker creates a space of witness, of airing grievances, of pointing out patterns.

It is wry and atmospheric, an epic work of aural pleasures and personifications that demands to be read&#x2015;both as an account of a private life and as searing political protest.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Glory Edim, <em>TIME</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;2019 justly belongs to Morgan Parker. Her poems shred me with their intelligence, dark humor and black-hearted vision. Parker is one of this generation&#x2019;s best minds, able to hold herself and her world, which includes all of us, up to impossible lights, revealing every last bit of our hopes, failings, possibilities and raptures.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Danez Smith, <em>T Magazine</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This collection further evidences Morgan Parker&#x2019;s considerable consequence in American poetry.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The New York Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Morgan Parker continues to fearlessly explore what it means to be a black woman in the United States today. . . . Bold and edgy, the writing spotlights the strength and tenacity that enable the speaker to survive grief and inequity.&nbsp;It&nbsp;also gives voice to her disappointments and delights as she claims&#x2015;and proclaims&#x2015;agency over her body and her life.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;From dating white boys to imagining what Diana Ross was thinking in that famous photo where she licks her fingers after eating a pair of ribs, Parker&#x2019;s second poetry collection runs the gamut. But each poem is written with her signature wry humor and caustic honesty.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>BuzzFeed</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Morgan Parker&#x2019;s poetry is vital, in both senses of the word. Her most recent collection,&nbsp;<em>There Are Things More Beautiful Than Beyonc�</em>,&nbsp;was an absolute knockout&#x2015;a breathtaking exploration of black womanhood, culture both pop and past, bodies, minds. Poetry&#x2019;s defenders need not answer those who would sing its dirges, but if they did, Parker&#x2019;s work could serve as an indisputable response.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Literary Hub</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Told with Parker&#x2019;s signature lyricism and humor; her poems have the ability to soothe and to incite, she nimbly creates spaces for you to rest while reading, and let the power of her words and message sink into you like a heavy stone into water, or a hot knife through butter. It&#x2019;s nothing short of triumphant.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>NYLON</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Parker&#x2019;s voice is surprising, ranging from elegiac to conspiratorial to ecstatic; she interrogates both blackness and femininity like ports in a long personal journey, as places to land but also as points of departure.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Vogue</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Fierce, playful and political, Parker&#x2019;s poems celebrate the everyday just as they face off ancestral hurt. . . .&nbsp;Holding history and the contemporary to account,&nbsp;<em>Magical Negro</em>&nbsp;meets prejudice with an unwavering eye.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Guardian</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Parker&#x2019;s poetry seamlessly intertwines moments of intimate introspection, euphoria, desire, and sorrow with reflections on the psychological and spiritual legacy of Black America.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Broadly</em></strong></p><h2>The Masters and Their Retreats (Climb the Highest Mountain Series)</h2><p>The great lights that have come out of the world's spiritual traditions and graduated from earth's schoolroom are known as ascended masters. They demonstrate to us that in the world of Spirit, there is no division of race, religion or philosophy. What is not widely known about these great masters is that they have retreats&#x2015;temples and cities of light in the heaven world that can be visited during spiritual meditation and while our bodies sleep at night. In this comprehensive work, the authors speak about these masters, the stories of their lives and their incredible retreats. More than 200 illustrations.</p><p>Mark L. Prophet (1918-1973) and Elizabeth Clare Prophet (19392009), were visionary pioneers of modern spirituality and internationally renowned authors. Their books are published in more than 30 languages, and millions of copies have been sold online and in bookstores worldwide. Together, they built a worldwide spiritual organization that is helping thousands to find their way out of human problems and reconnect to their inner divinity. They walked the path of spiritual adeptship, advancing through the universal initiations common to mystics of both East and West. They taught about this path and described their own experiences for the benefit of all who desire to make spiritual progress. Mark and Elizabeth left an extensive library of spiritual teachings from the ascended masters and a thriving, worldwide community of people who study and practice these teachings.</p><h2>Rejoicing in Lament: Wrestling with Incurable Cancer and Life in Christ</h2><p>At the age of thirty-nine, Christian theologian Todd Billings was diagnosed with a rare form of incurable cancer. In the wake of that diagnosis, he began grappling with the hard theological questions we face in the midst of crisis: Why me? Why now? Where is God in all of this? This eloquently written book shares Billings&#39;s journey, struggle, and reflections on providence, lament, and life in Christ in light of his illness, moving beyond pat answers toward hope in God&#39;s promises. Theologically robust yet eminently practical, it engages the open questions, areas of mystery, and times of disorientation in the Christian life. Billings offers concrete examples through autobiography, cultural commentary, and stories from others, showing how our human stories of joy and grief can be incorporated into the larger biblical story of God&#39;s saving work in Christ.</p><p>"<i>Rejoicing in Lament</i> is a profound witness to the gospel.

A prominent adviser&nbsp;to the Ken Burns&nbsp;Emmy Award-winning documentary, "The National Parks: America's Best Idea,"&nbsp;Alfred Runte is renowned as the nation's leading historian on the meaning and management of these treasured lands.&nbsp; Lavishly illustrated with period photographs, including eight pages of color paintings, National Parks: The American Experience has never been more beautiful or profound.&nbsp; This&nbsp;remains a stirring look into the lands that define America, from Yosemite and Yellowstone to wilderness Alaska.&nbsp; This is how we got our parks, and yes, how we have occasionally failed them, and when doing so how we have failed ourselves.&nbsp; "Civilization is the problem parks solve," Runte writes.&nbsp; At times, the national parks may seem as imperfect as they are exceptional; the point is that they are all we will ever have.&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing that earlier America, and planning for the new America, still demands&nbsp;our humility to advance the best of both.</p><p>An internationally recognized expert on America's national parks, Alfred Runte is based in Seattle, Washington. He was recently an adviser to the Ken Burns PBS documentary <i>The National Parks: America's Best Idea</i> and appeared in all six episodes of the Emmy Award-winning series. Runte has also been a guest on <i>Nightline</i>, <i>The Today Show</i>, <i>48</i> <i>Hours</i>, the History and Travel channels, and speaks frequently in public forums on the need to protect our parks. His other books include <i>Allies of the Earth: Railroads and the</i> <i>Soul of Preservation</i>, <i>Yosemite: The Embattled Wilderness</i>, and <i>Trains of Discovery: Railroads and the Legacy of Our National Parks</i>, now in its fifth edition. In April 2011, Runte was elected to membership in the College of Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame at Illinois State University (his master's degree institution) "in recognition of exemplary achievement" as a teacher and public scholar. He also holds a B.A. from the State University of New York at Binghamton and a Ph.D. from the University of California, Santa Barbara.Like John Muir, Al Runte has felt the siren call of our saved&#x2014;and sacred&#x2014;places, and, like John Muir, he has found a way to share their glories with power and poetry. This is a sensitive, well-written history of our land and the complicated people who call it home. (Ken Burns )<br><br>Alfred Runte brilliantly demonstrates why he is considered one of America's preeminent environmental historians. Not only does National Parks sing with inspiration, but it is the most trustworthy synthesis scholars have on the American preservation movement. Everybody should read this marvelous study. Highly recommended! (Douglas Brinkley )<br><br>Congratulations to Al Runte on the fourth edition of National Parks: The American Experience. Al understands and captures not only the history of our national parks but also their importance to the United States and the world. From Al's childhood experiences in national parks to all the research he has done on their history and value, his fourth edition captures why our national parks are America's best idea. (Fran P. Mainella )<br><br>Having had a role in the beginnings of this important book, it is an honor to celebrate its fourth edition. Al Runte reminds us how dramatically the valuation of national parks has changed in little more than a century. Read it and you will learn why national parks can be considered a distinctively American idea, indeed a contribution of our nation to world civilization. (Professor Emeritus Roderick Frazier Nash )<br><br>Alfred Runte gives a comprehensive discussion of America's parks. National Parks is a choice and solidly recommended addition to natural history collections. (<i>Midwest Book Review</i> )</p><h2>A Sense of the World: How a Blind Man Became History&#39;s Greatest Traveler</h2><p><p> He was known simply as the Blind Traveler. A solitary, sightless adventurer, James Holman (1786-1857) fought the slave trade in Africa, survived a frozen captivity in Siberia, hunted rogue elephants in Ceylon, helped chart the Australian outback&#x2014;and, astonishingly, circumnavigated the globe, becoming one of the greatest wonders of the world he so sagaciously explored. <i>A Sense of the World</i> is a spellbinding and moving rediscovery of one of history's most epic lives&#x2014;a story to awaken our own senses of awe and wonder. </p></p><p><p>Jason Roberts is the inaugural winner of the Van Zorn Prize for emerging writers (sponsored by Michael Chabon) and a contributor to the <em>Village Voice, McSweeney's, The Believer,</em> and other publications. He lives in Northern California.</p>Before there were cars, long-distance buses, high-speed trains and jet airplanes, there was a man who traveled a quarter of a million miles. He did it by cart, by carriage, by sledge, by ship and by foot. And he did it "intermittently crippled" and "permanently blind." His name was James Holman, and for a time he was the most famous of the many intrepid English travelers who set out for faraway places at the end of the Napoleonic Wars.<p> Holman and his heroic achievements are all but forgotten today. Long before his death in 1857, he had faded into lonely obscurity, a relic of a romantic, pre-mechanized age. Jason Roberts first saw mention of him in a slim book called Eccentric Travelers. But Holman's only eccentricity was his urgent need "to cling to the road like a lifeline," writes Roberts in A Sense of the World, an eloquent and sympathetic biography of the long-gone voyager.</p><p> Holman's afflictions were somewhat mysterious. Born in Essex in 1786, he'd gone to sea in the Royal Navy at the age of 12. After three years spent on the damp, frigid deck of the HMS Cambrian, a frigate based out of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Holman developed what seemed to be rheumatism, an old man's illness that afflicted many young sailors. When he sought a cure in Bath, his rheumatic symptoms eased, but he lost his sight mysteriously and completely. </p><p> Roberts is gruesomely thorough in depicting the perils -- mostly from the medical profession -- that threatened the blind in the early 19th century. "In 1811," writes Roberts, "even the most enlightened medical professional knew no more about the eye than might a curious butcher." Cures for blindness included leeches, couching (poking a thick needle into the pupil) and setons (threads sewn vertically between the shoulder blades "to draw down the head's malignant humors"; they invariably became septic). If none of those methods worked (and it was pure luck if they did), the blind could expect a life of reliance on charity: "Almost no one wanted to hire the blind . . . . Most sighted people were unsettled by [their] presence," writes Roberts. </p><p>But Holman rejected every curb on his independence. He refused to wear the customary rag over his eyes, and he developed a surefire way of moving around on his own: a metal walking stick that produced "an authoritative series of taps" allowing him to navigate by sound. And to avoid outright charity, he finagled a lifetime appointment as a Naval Knight of Windsor, which provided him with lodging and a stipend as long as he attended daily service in the castle's chapel.</p><p> Holman did not attend chapel for long. His health began to fail, and his doctors conveniently prescribed convalescence in sunny France. It was Holman's first solo journey in a foreign country, and he found it exhilarating. Likely, his doctors did not envision the sort of footloose travel cure that he came to favor. Granted a one-year leave from the Naval Knights, he was away for two, traveling through much of Europe, never staying in one place very long. Travel, he quickly realized, was "the only thing keeping him alive." </p><p>When he returned, he wrote a bestselling book of his journeys that earned him the sobriquet the "Blind Traveler." And he began making ambitious (and surreptitious) plans to circumnavigate the globe. His poverty dictated his itinerary -- and his wish to circumvent officious friends dictated the secretiveness. He decided to go by land through Russia, traveling like the "impoverished peasantry . . . in simple horse-drawn carts and wheel-less sledges" and saving money "by engaging no guide or translator, trusting himself to pick up the notoriously difficult Russian language in transit." His friends would have been right to interfere. "Reaching the Pacific this way," writes Roberts, "meant crossing some of the world's coldest, harshest, and least-charted terrain, lands so bleak that even the more hospitable parts had been serving as a much-dreaded penal colony for almost two centuries."</p><p>But nothing could have pleased Holman more, as he later wrote: "I was engaged under circumstances of unusual occurrence, in a solitary journey of several thousand miles,through a country, perhaps the wildest on the face of the earth, and whose inhabitants were scarcely yet accounted within the pale of civilization; with no other attendant than a rude Tartar postillion, to whose language my ear was wholly unaccustomed. And yet I was supported by a feeling of happy confidence." </p><p>And he almost pulled it off, making it as far as Irkutsk, "the world's most isolated city," when the czar got wind of the traveling Englishman. Fearing that Holman would discover the extent of Russia's forays into North America, Czar Alexander had the blind man unceremoniously kidnapped and dumped on the Polish border.</p><p> Holman's Russian troubles weren't over when he returned to England. There, he discovered that a treacherous fellow traveler had leveled charges that would dog Holman for rest of his life. John Dundas Cochrane, known as the "Pedestrian Traveler," had made it almost as far across Russia as Holman had, on foot. But in his account of his journey, he made Holman into "a sort of harbinger marking the end of risk," asking "Who will then say that Siberia is a wild, inhospitable, or impassible country, when even the blind can traverse it with safety?" </p><p> While that charge -- that if the blind Holman could make the journey, it was no great traveling feat -- became a theme of later reviews of Holman's books, it hardly dampened his wanderlust. Into his sixth decade, he was "an intrepid invalid (at times simultaneously incapable of standing up and standing still)." He embarked on what was for the Royal Navy "the deadliest expedition of all time" to the miasmic African island of Fernando Po, an outpost for attacks on the slave trade. From there, he went on to Buenos Aires, South Africa, Madagascar, India, China, Australia and beyond. "Somewhere in the Atlantic, approaching England, Holman at last completed his circuit of the world," writes Roberts.</p><p> Holman died alone in London, a week after finishing the autobiography that he hoped would be his claim to long-lasting fame. That book was never published; his heir lost the manuscript. But at last Holman has an enthusiastic champion. Perhaps too enthusiastic: Roberts is rather quick to defend some of Holman's more egregious errors, including his tendency to pad his books with unreliable accounts of places to which he'd never traveled. And yet his obvious admiration for Holman is right and proper: The man "could claim a thorough acquaintance with every inhabited continent, and direct contact with at least two hundred distinctly separate cultures," and he did so by willing himself forward, past every obstacle. Roberts's vibrant prose and meticulous recreation of Holman's world offer modern readers a chance to see what Holman saw as he tapped his way around the globe. </p><p>Reviewed by Rachel Hartigan Shea <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

For a group of apprentice architects, artists, and designers, led by a visionary, the dire situation of their country was not an obstacle but an inspiration to plan and think... although they were very different characters, the architects worked closely together to realize their dreams, staunchly supported by a super-creative bureaucracy and an activist state... after 15 years of incubation, they surprised the world with a new architecture&#x2015;Metabolism&#x2015;that proposed a radical makeover of the entire land... Then newspapers, magazines, and TV turned the architects into heroes: thinkers and doers, thoroughly modern men... Through sheer hard work, discipline, and the integration of all forms of creativity, their country, Japan, became a shining example... when the oil crisis initiated the end of the West, the architects of Japan spread out over the world to define the contours of a post-Western aesthetic....&#x201d; &#x2015;Rem Koolhaas / Hans Ulrich Obrist</p><p>Between 2005 and 2011, architect Rem Koolhaas and curator Hans Ulrich Obrist interviewed the surviving members of Metabolism&#x2015;the first non-Western avant-garde, launched in Tokyo in 1960, in the midst of Japan&#x2019;s postwar miracle.

English, German, Dutch, Icelandic, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish peoples are all directly descended from this ancient Germanic cultural stock. According to author Edred Thorsson, if you are interested in living a holistic life with unity of body-mind-spirit, a key to knowing your spiritual heritage is found in the heritage of your body-in the natural features which you have inherited from your distant ancestors. Most readers of this book already "speak the language" of the Teutonic tradition.</p> <p><em>Northern Magic</em> contains material that has never before been discussed in a practical way. This book outlines the ways of Northern magic and the character of the Northern magician. It explores the theories of traditional Northern psychology (or the lore of the soul) in some depth, as well as the religious tradition of the Troth and the whole Germanic theology. The remaining chapters make up a series of "mini-grimoires" on four basic magical techniques in the Northern Way: Younger Futhark rune magic, Icelandic galdor staves, Pennsylvania hex signs, and "seith" (or shamanism). This is an excellent overview of the Teutonic tradition that will interest neophytes as well as long-time travelers along the Northern Way.</p> <ul> <li>Contains four complete handbooks of magical practice in one</li> <li>Gives practical instructions on how to carve runes and make hex-signs</li> <li>Provides the history of the Northern Renaissance</li> <li>Outlines the Germanic Gods and Goddesses</li> </ul></p><p>Since 1972, Edred Thorsson has been dedicated to the esoteric and esoteric study of the Indo-European, Celtic and Teutonic traditions.

Mr. Farley went on to write thirty-three other enormously popular books about the Black Stallion and other horses which were published in more than twenty countries. He died in 1989, shortly before the publication of his last novel,&nbsp;<i>The Young Black Stallion</i>, written with his son Steven.<p>Although the early June morning was unusually cool and the sky overcast, the boy's body perspired freely beneath his thin sweater. For this morning, as on every&nbsp;Saturday morning, he had walked the five miles from his home to the training track just outside the town limits of Coronet, Pennsylvania. And now he stood beneath a tall elm tree, his eyes upon the drab gray sheds before him. Grim-faced, he walked toward&nbsp;them, his gaze never leaving the sheds--not even for the horses, who trotted about the half-mile track to his left. He heard neither the rhythmic beat of hoofs over hard-packed clay nor the clucking of the drivers to their colts as they sat in their two-wheeled training carts. And this was very unusual for Tom Messenger.<br> He walked down the road until he came to the last shed in the row, and there he hesitated, his long, thin face grave with concern, his arms hanging loosely&nbsp;beside his big-boned but gaunt frame. It was many moments before he moved to the closed door of the shed, his steps noticeably shorter and slower.<br> Looking through the window, he saw the two old men working over Symbol. Jimmy Creech stood before the horse's big black head. As always, Jimmy's muffler was wrapped snugly about his scrawny neck, and his cap was pulled far down over his ears. The tip of Jimmy's prominent nose held the only color in his pale face. George Snedecker stooped to the other side of the&nbsp;horse, his hands feeling about Symbol's hoofs.<br> Slowly the boy slid the door open, and he heard George Snedecker say, "Pains in my legs again this morning, Jimmy. Makes a man wish he were dead, that's what it does."<br> "We ain't so young any more," Jimmy Creech grumbled; then he saw the boy standing in the doorway. He nodded to him but said nothing, and turned back to Symbol.<br> With great effort George rose to a standing position. " 'Morning, Tom," he said. The chaw of tobacco in his mouth was passed from one&nbsp;side to the other as his gaze shifted uneasily between the boy and Jimmy Creech; then he took a cloth from the pocket of his overalls and brushed it over Symbol's neck. He said with attempted lightness, "No need to work over Symbol, heh, Jimmy? He'll stir&nbsp;up enough wind to wipe him clean."<br> Jimmy Creech looked sullenly into George's grinning, tobacco-stained mouth. "Sure" he said. "Let's get the stuff on him now."<br> The boy stood there while they slid the light racing harness on Symbol and tightened the leather about the shafts of the training cart. Jimmy Creech had taken hold of the long reins when the boy said, "You're really going to sell her, Jimmy? You haven't changed your mind since last Saturday?" His voice was low and heavy with concern.<br> Jimmy Creech turned to George, motioning him to open the shed doors. "I'm selling her," he said quickly, without looking at the boy. "This morning . . . the guy's coming this morning, just as I told you last Saturday."<br> "But Jimmy--" The boy was close beside Jimmy Creech now, his hands on the man's arm, his words coming fast. "Her colt may be everything you ever hoped to own. You figured it that way. You said--"<br> Jimmy Creech had slid into the cart seat. "I know what I said, what I figured," he interrupted, turning away. "You don't have to tell me, Tom."<br> "Then why do you want to sell the Queen at this late stage of the game?" the boy asked with sudden anger. "She'll have her foal in another three weeks. Why don't you do as we planned?"<br> Jimmy Creech drew his muffler tighter about his neck, and his eyes were upon Symbol's black haunches as he said bitterly, "I figured out one night that it was a pretty late stage in the game for me, too. I figured up how old I was and I got sixty-two. I figured that it's no time for me&nbsp;to be looking ahead a couple of years, and I'd have to wait that long before I could race this colt of the Queen's. So I figured two years is much too long for me to wait. That's the score, Tom. I'm sorry."<br> "But, Jimmy. You're being silly. You're not old.&nbsp;You're--"<br> But Jimmy Creech was taking Symbol from the shed.<br> The boy watched Jimmy until he had driven Symbol around the corner of the shed; then he turned to George, now seated heavily in his chair beside the door. "What's gotten into Jimmy?" the boy asked. "Why's he talking like that?"<br> "He ain't been feeling good again," George said. "And sixty-two's not so young any more, like Jimmy says. Age is like that, Tom. For years you go along&nbsp;thinking you're a young bunny, then one morning you wake up and it's hit you right smack in every bone and muscle in your body. Like it did with me some years ago. And like it's doing to Jimmy now. And when that happens you find you don't start figuring too far ahead any longer." George leaned back in his chair. "Yep, I know what Jimmy means when he says he don't want to wait two years for the Queen's colt to come along."<br> Shaking his head, the boy said, "But all winter long Jimmy felt good. I know he did.&nbsp;He'd talk about this foal of the Queen's for hours at a time, telling me the colt was going to be the one he'd always wanted. You heard him, George. And you know our plans. He was going to send the Queen up to my uncle's farm, where she was going to have&nbsp;her foal. And I was going to take care of them both this summer while you and Jimmy were at the fair tracks racing Symbol. It was just the setup he wanted for them. Uncle Wilmer has plenty of pasture; everything the Queen and her foal could want during the&nbsp;summer. I don't understand why--"<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>Planets in Youth: Patterns of Early Development (The Planet Series)</h2><p>To Robert Hand, children are adults in the process of becoming. Parents will welcome this book and use it to help their children learn to cope with the complexities of modern life. Readers of all ages will use it to understand their own patterns of early development. The first four chapters define the roles of mother and father, explain the effects of various planetary energy systems and discuss the meaning of elements and crosses in a child&#39;s chart. Hand analyzes the charts of three children, including Judy Garland and Shirley Temple, to illustrate the astrological principles and psychological insights set forth in his intriguing study of personality development. The major part of the book consists of delineations of horoscope factors, written with young people in mind. Every planet in every sign, house and major aspect, as well as every rising sign, is interpreted in about three hundred words that stress possibilities rather than certainties.</p><p></p><h2>Happiness: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;Throughout <i>Happiness</i>, Forna stops in our tracks . . .

The distraction causes two pedestrians to collide&#x2015;Jean, an American studying the habits of urban foxes, and Attila, a Ghanaian psychiatrist there to deliver a keynote speech. From this chance encounter, Aminatta Forna&#x2019;s unerring powers of observation show how in the midst of the rush of a great city lie numerous moments of connection. </p> <p>Attila has arrived in London with two tasks: to deliver a keynote speech on trauma, as he has done many times before; and to contact the daughter of friends, his &#x201c;niece&#x201d; who hasn&#x2019;t called home in a while. Ama has been swept up in an immigration crackdown, and now her young son Tano is missing.</p> <p>When, by chance, Attila runs into Jean again, she mobilizes the network of rubbish men she uses as volunteer fox spotters. Security guards, hotel doormen, traffic wardens&#x2015;mainly West African immigrants who work the myriad streets of London&#x2015;come together to help. As the search for Tano continues, a deepening friendship between Attila and Jean unfolds. </p> <p>Meanwhile a consulting case causes Attila to question the impact of his own ideas on trauma, the values of the society he finds himself in, and a grief of his own. In this delicate tale of love and loss, of cruelty and kindness, Forna asks us to consider the interconnectedness of lives, our co-existence with one another and all living creatures, and the true nature of happiness.</p></p><p><b>Aminatta Forna</b> is the author of the novels <i>Ancestor Stones</i>, <i>The Memory of Love</i>, and <i>The Hired Man</i>, as well as the memoir <i>The Devil That Danced on the Water</i>.

Seen as a refreshing alternative to the techniques and limitations of modern psychology, such practices offer new insights for pastoral care. But many remain unclear on what spiritual direction is and whether its methods are applicable to their own clients and parishioners. Spiritual direction is a practice of Christian soul care that is found most notably in the Catholic, Orthodox and Episcopal traditions but is also present in Wesleyan/Holiness, Pentecostal/charismatic, social justice and Reformed communities. Predating modern counseling and psychotherapy movements but sharing key principles and insights for spiritual formation, spiritual direction offers significant resources for today?s pastors, counselors, therapists, chaplains and other caregivers attuned to the work of God in people?s lives. In this landmark volume, editors Gary W. Moon and David G. Benner, along with a team of expert contributors, provide a comprehensive survey of spiritual direction in its myriad Christian forms. Specific chapters offer careful historical perspective and contemporary analysis of how Christians from various backgrounds have practiced spiritual direction, with particular attention to each tradition?s definition of spiritual direction, the process of authentic transformation, the role of the spiritual director, indicators of mature spirituality and other aspects of the spiritual direction process. Chapters also provide psychological and clinical insight into how spiritual direction is similar to, different from and can be integrated with psychotherapy and pastoral counseling to help others experience spiritual transformation and union with God.</p><p>"The variety of insightful authors brought together by the editors of this book offer the reader a unique and valuable perspective on the ways eight different Christian traditions understand and practice spiritual companionship, as well as elucidating the relation of this historic spiritual practice to modern pastoral counseling and psychotherapy. The book offers a distinctive contribution to the growing literature on this vital subject." The Rev. Dr. Tilden Edwards, Founder and Senior Fellow, Shalem Institute for Spiritual Formation, Bethesda, Maryland <p>"There is a tradition of wisdom about human life and the nature of change that has been lost to many of us in the evangelical community. Spiritual Direction and the Care of Souls recaptures that wisdom from multiple perspectives and makes it available to us all. This is a rich resource for pastors, counselors, small group leaders and everyone interested in change." John Ortberg, Teaching Pastor, Menlo Park Presbyterian Church </p><p>"Gary W. Moon and David G. Benner are respected and visionary leaders in contemporary Christian soul care. Spiritual Direction and the Care of Souls is an excellent resource for those seeking to understand major traditions of spiritual direction and distinguish among psychotherapy, spiritual direction and pastoral counseling. History, wisdom, faith and compassion meet in the pages of this book." Mark R. McMinn, Rech Professor of Psychology, Wheaton College, Author of Why Sin Matters </p><p>"Is anything more needed in our present culture than spiritual direction and soul care? I think not. So I'm elated with this comprehensive guide to spiritual direction. It is both theoretical and practical. I welcome it especially for pastors, professors and persons training for ministry. Only able advocates and practitioners of spiritual direction--Dr. Benner and Dr. Moon--could have put together this remarkable resource. I commend it." Maxie D.

Khiara M. Bridges investigates how race&#x2015;commonly seen as biological in the medical world&#x2015;is socially constructed among women dependent on the public healthcare system for prenatal care and childbirth. Bridges argues that race carries powerful material consequences for these women even when it is not explicitly named, showing how they are marginalized by the practices and assumptions of the clinic staff. Deftly weaving ethnographic evidence into broader discussions of Medicaid and racial disparities in infant and maternal mortality, Bridges shines new light on the politics of healthcare for the poor, demonstrating how the &#x201c;medicalization&#x201d; of social problems reproduces racial stereotypes and governs the bodies of poor women of color.</p><p>&#x201c;Bridges radically and actively demonstrates the truth of her claims through outstanding ethnography and analysis.

Every practitioner and student who works or plans to work with individuals with addiction will benefit from the fifth edition's wealth of up-to-date knowledge. I am impressed by the attention to current research influencing the field, as well as the illustrative case examples that ground the reader in the experience of addicted individuals. This text does not shy away from the important questions and controversies about disease models, causes of addiction, and types of public health and treatment approaches. If you and your students want diverse, multidimensional perspectives on addiction, presented synergistically, this is the text you should choose."--Carlo C. DiClemente, PhD, ABPP, Department of Psychology (Emeritus), University of Maryland, Baltimore County<br><br> "This book is useful to a wide range of clinicians working in substance abuse treatment. It introduces students and entry-level practitioners to addictive behaviors on multiple levels--theoretical models, research findings, and practical clinical interventions. More experienced practitioners will find it an excellent update and review. By providing multiple perspectives, the book gives a good foundation for individualizing treatment."--Joan E. Zweben, PhD, Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco; staff psychologist, San Francisco VA Medical Center<br><br> "This is one of the best books I have read that integrates theory, research, and practice in addictions. The highly accessible fifth edition includes outstanding coverage of the genetics of addictive behaviors, as well as other updates. What I love about this book is that Thombs and Osborn offer the reader a wide variety of strategies for addressing substance use problems, providing the flexibility needed to meet the needs of different groups of clients. I will use this text in my master&#x2019;s-level social work courses; it is a great resource for students as they develop as clinicians and begin to practice in diverse settings."--Mary Marden Velasquez, PhD, Director, Health Behavior Research and Training Institute, School of Social Work, The University of Texas at Austin<br><br> "I have used successive editions of this text in my advanced undergraduate seminar on addictions for almost 20 years. The fifth edition does an excellent job of covering new findings and treatment methods while still preserving much of the classic literature. Without question, this text offers the most comprehensive and objective coverage of this very complex subject. In an age of misinformation and 'alternative facts,' Thombs and Osborn remain committed to rigorous science and how it can be translated into effective treatment and prevention. They provide balanced, unbiased coverage of many different ways of understanding addiction, giving a fair hearing to every point of view."--Richard Siegel, PhD, Department of Psychology (Emeritus), University of Massachusetts Lowell<br><br> "I have used prior editions of this book as the main text in my undergraduate Research on Addictive Behaviors class for years. The authors provide a readable and comprehensive review of theories of addiction and current issues in the field. The fifth edition includes a fully revised chapter on social and cultural foundations of addiction, with approachable discussions of the opioid crisis, stigma, and the evolving addiction treatment industry."--Kathleen M. Palm Reed, PhD, Department of Psychology, Clark University<br><br>"Thombs and Osborn, both accomplished researchers and clinicians in addictions studies, found the right blend to appeal to all levels in this intellectual marketplace. With their systematic prose and pedagogical aids for enhancing readability--end-of-chapter summaries and review questions for each chapter--the authors help students master the addictions literature.

To make matters worse, the Paladin, renowned champion of the Kings of Landover, seems to be merely a legend.<br><br> Ben&#x2019;s only allies are a bumbling court magician, a talking dog turned court scribe, and the beautiful Willow, who is part girl, part tree.

The question is: Can he survive?</p><p><b>Terry Brooks</b>&nbsp;has thrilled readers for decades with his powers of imagination and storytelling. He is the author of more than thirty books, most of which have been&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers. He lives with his wife, Judine, in the Pacific Northwest.<i>Ben<br></i><br><br>&nbsp;The catalogue was from Rosen&#x2019;s, Ltd. It was the department store&#x2019;s annual&nbsp;Christmas Wishbook.&nbsp;<br><br>It was addressed to Annie.&nbsp;<br><br>Ben Holiday stood frozen before the open cubicle of his mailbox, eyes slipping&nbsp;across the gaily decorated cover of the catalogue to the white address&nbsp;label and the name of his dead wife. The lobby of the Chicago high rise seemed&nbsp;oddly still in the graying dusk of the late afternoon rush hour, empty of everyone&nbsp;but the security guard and himself. Outside, past the line of floor- toceiling&nbsp;windows that fronted the building entry, the autumn wind blew in&nbsp;chill gusts down the canyon of Michigan Avenue and whispered of winter&#x2019;s&nbsp;coming.&nbsp;<br><br>He ran his thumb over the smooth surface of the Wishbook. Annie had&nbsp;loved to shop, even when the shopping had only been through the mail- order&nbsp;catalogues. Rosen&#x2019;s had been one of her favorite stores.&nbsp;<br><br>Sudden tears filled his eyes. He hadn&#x2019;t gotten over losing her, even after&nbsp;two years. Sometimes it seemed to him that losing her was nothing more than&nbsp;a trick of his imagination&#x2014;that when he came home she would still be there&nbsp;waiting for him.&nbsp;<br><br>He took a deep breath, fighting back against the emotions that were&nbsp;aroused in him simply by seeing her name on that catalogue cover. It was silly&nbsp;to feel like this. Nothing could bring her back to him. Nothing could change&nbsp;what had happened.&nbsp;<br><br>His eyes lifted to stare into the dark square of the now- empty mailbox. He&nbsp;remembered what it had been like when he had first learned that she had been&nbsp;killed. He had just returned from court, a pre- trial on the Microlab case with&nbsp;old Wilson Frink and his sons. Ben was in his office, thinking of ways to persuade&nbsp;his opposition, a lawyer named Bates, that his latest offer of settlement&nbsp;would serve everyone&#x2019;s best interests, when the call had come in. Annie had&nbsp;been in an accident on the Kennedy. She was at St. Jude&#x2019;s in critical condition.&nbsp;Could he come right over . . . ?<br><br>&nbsp;He shook his head. He could still hear the voice of the doctor telling him&nbsp;what had happened. The voice had sounded so calm and rational. He had&nbsp;known at once that Annie was dying. He had known instantly. By the time he&nbsp;had gotten to the hospital, she was dead. The baby was dead, too. Annie had&nbsp;been only three months pregnant.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Holiday?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>He looked about sharply, startled by the voice. George, the security&nbsp;guard, was looking over at him from behind the lobby desk.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Everything all right, sir?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>He nodded and forced a quick smile. &#x201c;Yes&#x2014;just thinking about something.&#x201d;&nbsp;He closed the mailbox door, shoved everything he had taken from it save&nbsp;the catalogue into one coat pocket and, still gripping the Wishbook in both&nbsp;hands, moved to the ground- floor elevators. He didn&#x2019;t care for being caught&nbsp;off balance like that. Maybe it was the lawyer in him.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Cold day out there,&#x201d; George offered, glancing out into the gray. &#x201c;Going to&nbsp;be a tough winter. Lot of snow, they say. Like it was a couple of years ago.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Looks that way.&#x201d; Ben barely heard him as he glanced down again at the&nbsp;catalogue. Annie always enjoyed the Christmas Wishbook. She used to read&nbsp;him promos from some of its more bizarre items. She used to make up stories&nbsp;about the kind of people who might purchase such things.&nbsp;<br><br>He pushed the elevator call button and the doors opened immediately.&nbsp;&#x201c;Have a nice evening, sir,&#x201d; George called after him.&nbsp;<br><br>He rode the elevator to his penthouse suite, shucked off his topcoat, and&nbsp;walked into the front room, still clutching the catalogue. Shadows draped the&nbsp;furnishings and dappled the carpeting and walls, but he left the lights off and&nbsp;stood motionless before the bank of windows that looked out over the sunroof&nbsp;and the buildings of the city beyond. Lights glimmered through the&nbsp;evening gray, distant and solitary, each a source of life separate and apart from&nbsp;the thousands of others.&nbsp;<br><br>We are so much of the time alone, he thought. Wasn&#x2019;t it strange?&nbsp;<br><br>He looked down again at the catalogue. Why do you suppose they had sent&nbsp;it to Annie? Why were companies always sending mailers and flyers and free&nbsp;samples and God- knew- what- all to people long after they were dead and&nbsp;buried? It was an intrusion on their privacy. It was an affront. Didn&#x2019;t these&nbsp;companies update their mailing lists? Or was it simply that they refused ever&nbsp;to give up on a customer?&nbsp;<br><br>He checked his anger and, instead, smiled, bitter, ironic. Maybe he should&nbsp;phone it all in to Andy Rooney. Let him write about it.&nbsp;<br><br>He turned on the lights then and walked over to the wall bar to make himself a scotch, Glenlivet on the rocks with a splash of water; he measured it out&nbsp;and sipped at it experimentally. There was a bar meeting in a little less than&nbsp;two hours, and he had promised Miles that he would make this one. Miles&nbsp;Bennett was not only his partner, but he was probably his only real friend&nbsp;since Annie&#x2019;s death. All of the others had drifted away somehow, lost in the&nbsp;shufflings and rearrangings of life&#x2019;s social order. Couples and singles made a&nbsp;poor mix, and most of their friends had been couples. He hadn&#x2019;t done much&nbsp;to foster continuing friendships in any case, spending most of his time involved&nbsp;with his work and with his private, inviolate grief. He was not such&nbsp;good company anymore, and only Miles had had the patience and the perseverance&nbsp;to stay with him.&nbsp;<br><br>He drank some more of the scotch and wandered back again to the open&nbsp;windows. The lights of the city winked back at him. Being alone wasn&#x2019;t so bad,&nbsp;he reasoned. That was just the way of things. He frowned. Well, that was his&nbsp;way, in any case. It was his choice to be alone. He could have found companionship&nbsp;again from any one of a number of sources; he could have reintegrated&nbsp;himself into almost any of the city&#x2019;s myriad social circles. He had the necessary&nbsp;attributes. He was young still and successful; he was even wealthy, if&nbsp;money counted for anything&#x2014;and in this world it almost always did. No, he&nbsp;didn&#x2019;t have to be alone.&nbsp;<br><br>And yet he did, because the problemwas that he really didn&#x2019;t belong anyway.&nbsp;He thought about that for a moment&#x2014;forced himself to think about it. It&nbsp;wasn&#x2019;t simply his choosing to be alone that kept him that way; it was almost a&nbsp;condition of his existence. The feeling that he was an outsider had always been&nbsp;there. Becoming a lawyer had helped him deal with that feeling, giving him a&nbsp;place in life, giving him a ground upon which he might firmly stand. But the&nbsp;sense of not belonging had persisted, however diminished its intensity&#x2014;a&nbsp;nagging certainty. Losing Annie had simply given it new life, emphasizing the&nbsp;transiency of any ties that bound him to whom and what he had let himself become.&nbsp;He often wondered if others felt as he did. He supposed they must; he&nbsp;supposed that to some extent everyone felt something of the same displacement.&nbsp;But not as strongly as he, he suspected. Never that strongly.&nbsp;<br><br>He knew Miles understood something of it&#x2014;or at least something of&nbsp;Ben&#x2019;s sense of it. Miles didn&#x2019;t feel about it as Ben did, of course. Miles was the&nbsp;quintessential people person, always at home with others, always comfortable&nbsp;with his surroundings. He wanted Ben to be that way; he wanted to bring him&nbsp;out of that self- imposed shell and back into the mainstream of life. He viewed&nbsp;his friend as some sort of challenge in that regard. That was why Miles was so&nbsp;persistent about these damn bar meetings. That was why he kept after Ben to&nbsp;forget about Annie and get on with his life.&nbsp;<br><br>He finished the scotch and made himself another. He was drinking a lot&nbsp;lately, he knew&#x2014;maybe more than was good for him. He glanced down at his&nbsp;watch. Forty- five minutes had gone by. Another forty- five and Miles would be<i>&nbsp;</i>there, his chaperone for the evening. He shook his head distastefully. Miles&nbsp;didn&#x2019;t understand nearly as much as he thought he did about some things.&nbsp;Carrying his drink, he walked back across the room to the windows,&nbsp;stared out a moment, and turned away, closing the drapes against the night.&nbsp;He moved back to the couch, debating on whether to check the answerphone,&nbsp;and saw the catalogue again. He must have put it down without realizing&nbsp;it. It was lying with the other mail on the coffee table in front of the&nbsp;sectional sofa, its glossy cover reflecting sharply in the lamplight.&nbsp;<br><br>Rosen&#x2019;s, Ltd.&#x2014;Christmas Wishbook.&nbsp;<br><br>He sat down slowly in front of it and picked it up. A Christmas catalogue&nbsp;of wishes and dreams&#x2014;he had seen the kind before. An annual release from a&nbsp;department store that ostensibly offered something for everyone, this particular&nbsp;catalogue was for the select few only&#x2014;the wealthy few.&nbsp;<br><br>Annie had always liked it, though.&nbsp;<br><br>Slowly, he began to page through it. The offerings jumped out at him, a&nbsp;collection of gifts for the hard- to- please, an assortment of oddities that were&nbsp;essentially one- of- a- kind and could be found nowhere but in the Wishbook.&nbsp;Dinner for two in the private California home of a famous movie star, transportation&nbsp;included. A ten- day cruise for sixty on a yacht, fully crewed and&nbsp;catered to order. A week on a privately owned Caribbean island, including the&nbsp;use of wine cellar and fully stocked larder. A bottle of one- hundred- and- fiftyyear-&nbsp;old wine. Hand- blown glass and diamond creations, designed per request.&nbsp;<br><br>A gold toothpick. Sable coats for little girls&#x2019; dolls. A collector&#x2019;s chess&nbsp;set of science fiction film characters carved from ebony. A hand- woven tapestry&nbsp;of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.&nbsp;<br><br>The list of offerings went on, item after item, each more exotic and&nbsp;strange than the one before. Ben took a strong pull on his scotch, almost repulsed&nbsp;by the extravagance of it all, but fascinated nevertheless. Then he&nbsp;thumbed ahead into the center of the catalogue. There was a transparent bathtub&nbsp;with live goldfish encased in the framework. There was a silver shaving kit&nbsp;with your initials inlaid in gold. Why in God&#x2019;s name would anyone . . . ?&nbsp;He caught himself midway through the thought, his eyes drawn instantly&nbsp;to an artist&#x2019;s rendering of the item being offered on the pages that lay open before&nbsp;him.&nbsp;<br><br>The promo of the item read as follows:&nbsp;<b><br><br>MAGIC KINGDOM FOR SALE&nbsp;</b><br><br>Landover&#x2014;island of enchantment and adventure rescued from the mists&nbsp;of time, home of knights and knaves, of dragons and damsels, of wizards&nbsp;and warlocks. Magic mixes with iron, and chivalry is the code of life for the true hero. All of your fantasies become real in this kingdom from another&nbsp;world. Only one thread to this whole cloth is lacking&#x2014;you, to&nbsp;rule over all as King and High Lord. Escape into your dreams, and be&nbsp;born again.&nbsp;<br><br>Price: $1,000,000.&nbsp;<br><br>Personal interview and financial disclosure.&nbsp;<br><br>Inquire of Meeks, home office.&nbsp;<br><br>That was all it read. The artist&#x2019;s colorful rendering depicted a knight on&nbsp;horseback engaged in battle with a fire- breathing dragon, a beautiful and&nbsp;rather thinly clad damsel shrinking from the conflict before a tower wall, and&nbsp;a dark- robed wizard lifting his hands as if to cast an awesome and life- stealing&nbsp;spell. Some creatures that might have been Elves or Gnomes or some such&nbsp;scampered about in the background, and the towers and parapets of great castles&nbsp;loomed against a gathering of hills and mists.&nbsp;<br><br>It had the look of something out of King Arthur and the Knights of the&nbsp;Round Table.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;This is nuts!&#x201d; he muttered almost without thinking.&nbsp;<br><br>He stared at the item in disbelief, certain that he must be mistaken. Then&nbsp;he read it again. He read it a third time. It read the same. He finished his&nbsp;scotch in a single gulp and chewed on the ice, irritated with the nonsensicality&nbsp;of the offering. A million dollars for a fairy- tale kingdom? It was ridiculous.&nbsp;It had to be some kind of joke.&nbsp;<br><br>He threw down the catalogue, jumped to his feet, and crossed to the bar&nbsp;to mix himself a fresh drink. He stared momentarily at his reflection in the&nbsp;mirrored cabinet&#x2014;a man of medium height, lean, trim, and athletic- looking,&nbsp;his face rather drawn, with high cheekbones and forehead, slightly receding&nbsp;hairline, hawk nose and piercing blue eyes. He was a man of thirty- nine going&nbsp;on fifty, a man on the verge of passing into middle age too young.&nbsp;<br><br>Escape into your dreams . . .&nbsp;<br><br>He crossed back to the couch, placed the drink on the coffee table and&nbsp;picked up the Wishbook once more. Again he read the item on Landover. He&nbsp;shook his head. No such place could possibly exist. The promo was a tease, a&nbsp;hype&#x2014;what the car business called puffing. The truth was masked in the&nbsp;rhetoric. He chewed gingerly at the inside of his lip. Still, there wasn&#x2019;t all that&nbsp;much rhetoric being used to promote the item. And Rosen&#x2019;s was a highly respected&nbsp;department store; they were not likely to offer anything that they&nbsp;could not deliver, should a buyer appear.&nbsp;<br><br>He grinned. What was he thinking? What buyer? Who in his right mind&nbsp;would even consider . . . ? But of course he was questioning himself now. He&nbsp;was the one considering. He had been standing there, drinking his drink and&nbsp;thinking about how he didn&#x2019;t belong; and when he had picked up the Wishbook,<i>&nbsp;</i>the item on Landover had caught his attention right away. He was the&nbsp;one who felt himself the outsider in his own world, who had always felt himself&nbsp;the outsider, who was seeking always a way to escape what he was.&nbsp;<br><br>And now here was his chance.&nbsp;<br><br>His grin broadened. This was crazy! He was actually contemplating doing&nbsp;something that no sane man would even think twice about!&nbsp;<br><br>The scotch was working its way to his head now, and he got up again to&nbsp;walk it off. He looked at his watch, thinking of Miles, and suddenly he didn&#x2019;t&nbsp;want to go to that bar meeting. He didn&#x2019;t want to go anywhere.&nbsp;<br><br>He walked to the phone and dialed his friend.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Bennett,&#x201d; the familiar voice answered.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Miles, I&#x2019;ve decided not to go tonight. Hope you don&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>There was a pause. &#x201c;Doc, is that you?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, it&#x2019;s me.&#x201d; Miles loved to call him Doc, ever since the early days when&nbsp;they went up against Wells- Fargo on that corporate buy- out. Doc Holiday,&nbsp;courtroom gunfighter. It drove Ben nuts. &#x201c;Look, you go on without me.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going.&#x201d; Miles was unflappable. &#x201c;You said you were going and you&#x2019;re&nbsp;going.

Charley Castillo, the retired U.S. army colonel and Secret Service agent attached to the president&#x2014;although his relationship with the new Oval Office occupant is decidedly more contentious than with the previous president&#x2014;learns about the kidnapping and immediately suspects that it could have been deliberately staged to get his attention. Could the abduction be part of a plot by Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin to capture and erase Charley once and for all? And, if it is, can Charley count on any of his former government colleagues to help him out? The father-and-son writing team of Griffin and Butterworth keeps the Castillo series interesting by throwing their hero into new situations, e.g., taking him from being a highly respected government agent to something approaching a full-on outlaw, operating in an environment in which key players in the government would like nothing more than to see him eliminated permanently.

His works have rung true with seekers for more than eight hundred years."Even though the Roman Catholic Church tried hard to suppress its German Dominican priest, Meister Eckhart, by excommunication and condemnation, his writings have remained influential. Eckhart has been especially important among those seeking ways to connect Eastern religious traditions to Christian ones. The problem is that Eckhart's writing is difficult reading, losing much in translation not only from German to English but also from the 13th to the 20th century. O'Neal has produced an exceptional introductory edition that makes Eckhart more accessible.

Rather, for the past fifty-five years, I have been a different kind of physician. I have counseled patients, striving to guide and uplift them by building their health and teaching them that there is a right way and a wrong way to live.</p><p>This does not mean I have not taken care of sick people. Hundreds of thousands of patients have entered my sanitariums&#x2014;many with serious chronic disease&#x2014;some in wheelchairs, several on stretchers. I have had the privilege of seeing the great majority of them leave free of the symptoms and conditions that brought them into my care.</p><p>I have treated these patients using a combination of proper nutrition, exercise, positive thinking exercises, water treatment, and other natural methods. Though I believe in the scientific merit of certain therapeutic drugs, I do not advise their use nor do I use them myself. Though I believe surgery has its place in the treatment of certain life-threatening diseases and extreme conditions, I advocate the use of less invasive, more natural methods in most cases.</p><p>I do not regard the healing art lightly. On the contrary, taking care of people has been both my life&#x2019;s ideal and its privilege. I sincerely feel that each person I treat is a living soul and a member of the family of man and, as such, is entitled to love and respect. As a physician, I feel a humanitarian responsibility to respond to suffering and its needs.</p><p>The story of how I developed my philosophy begins in 1926 when I was a young man of 18. It was then that I entered the West Coast Chiropractic College, supporting myself by working at a local dairy. Long hours of study, followed by long hours of work, combined with poor nutritional habits, posed a triple threat to my health. Shortly after my graduation from college I collapsed.</p><p>Physicians diagnosed my condition as bronchiectasis, an incurable lung disease, often fatal in those days before antibiotic treatment. I had inherited weak lungs from my mother, who died of tuberculosis at the age of 29. Lung weakness ran in my family, and now it had run into me.</p><p>It was about this time that I was introduced to a Seventh-Day Adventist physician who enlightened me on the differences between a poor food regimen and a healthy one. Sadly, his name escaped me over the years. I certainly owe him a debt of gratitude because of the path he set me upon. This doctor declared that a root of my problem was my nutritional deficiencies. I was, he said, starving myself with a &#x201c;junk food&#x201d; diet. In its place he prescribed a diet full of healthy foods. Combined with breathing exercises given by Thomas Gaines who once worked for the New York Police Department, my condition improved. I began to gain weight, put several inches of flesh back on my chest, and found renewed energy. I was back on the road to health.</p><p>Though I began my career in the health arts as a chiropractor, my remarkable experience with the regenerative abilities of proper nutrition and exercise spurred me to incorporate these healing methods in my growing practice. In addition, I continued my postgraduate education to keep abreast of new developments in natural health care. I worked alongside Dr. Ralph Benner of the Bircher-Benner Clinic in Zurich, Switzerland. I studied bowel management with Dr. John Harvey Kellogg of Battle Creek, Michigan; iridology with Dr. R. M. McClain of Oakland, California and Dr. F. W. Collins of Orange, New Jersey; homeopathy with Dr. Charles Gesser of Tampa, Florida; and water cure treatment at Bad W�rishofen, West Germany, home of nineteenth-century water therapy pioneer Fr. Sebastian Kneipp.</p><p>Now, at the age of 80, I often reflect on what it was in my life that allowed me to live this long&#x2014;to come this far. For though I had cured bronchiectasis with nutrition and exercise, I continued the frantic pace of work and study that, combined with my bad habits, had made me so ill so long ago. Looking back, I have concluded that wellness is as much a satisfying relationship with life as it is a consequence of dietary and lifestyle changes.</p><p>I believe the secret of my good health is that I am always good to myself mentally. I am convinced my longevity is due to my mental philosophy, my joyous contentment with life. I have always loved people. I have always loved seeing people who came to me for help return home healed. And these people loved me in return. I uplifted them to the best of my ability, and it always came back to me.</p><p>Perhaps it was the warmth of this kind of gratitude that provided the incentive and energy for me to do so much more than I had to do. When the people you take care of want to take care of you, life becomes a blessing. I feel I had blessings that uplifted me constantly.</p><p>For this reason I have come to believe that loving your work is one of the great secrets of health and high-level well-being. On most of my twelve-to-fourteen-hour-long days at sanitariums, including my ranch in California, I have never felt overworked or &#x201c;burned out&#x201d; at the end of the day. And each morning I awake eager to get going again because I love my work.</p><p>I have received many honors and awards during my lifetime, but the greatest gift I have ever been given is the gratitude, love, and respect of the thousands of patients whose lives have been changed by what I have been able to share with them. It is through serving them that I have found the greatest portion of my own life&#x2019;s happiness.</p><p>Introduction</p><p><b>F</b>rom the time of Hippocrates, it has been known that certain foods have disease-preventing and disease-healing benefits. Yet, for some reason this knowledge has remained one of history&#x2019;s best-kept secrets&#x2014;until its resurgence in very recent years.</p><p>Despite the growing body of documented medical evidence that diet both causes and cures disease, nutritional awareness remains far from a twentieth century world ideal. According to Stuart M. Berger, M.D., in <i>What Your Doctor Didn&#x2019;t Learn in Medical School,</i> currently a mere 24 of this country&#x2019;s 130 medical schools require future doctors to take courses in nutrition. By omitting the subject of nutrition, 80 percent of America&#x2019;s medical schools are not only perpetuating a nutritional &#x201c;knowledge vacuum,&#x201d; they are sending out a negative message about the importance of nutrition in health, as well.</p><p>With our doctors ill-educated on nutrition, it&#x2019;s no wonder the public continues to lag in its own nutritional awareness. For instance, a recent survey of 12,000 Americans by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) revealed a majority continues to practice poor eating habits, despite strong evidence that diet can reverse the course of some forms of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and learning disorders&#x2014;to name a few. Asked by NCI what they had eaten in the last 24 hours, more than 40 percent of the respondents said they had not had even one piece of fruit, and about 20 percent said they had not eaten even one vegetable. Just as discouraging, some 55 percent of the NCI survey group said they had eaten red meat, and more than 40 percent had at least one serving of luncheon meat or bacon that day.</p><p>Results like these lead me to believe that the message of good nutrition is not getting out there. Because of this, it is my hope that this book becomes a nutritional guidebook for the common man&#x2019;s journey toward disease-free living through proper nutrition.</p><p>Far from a &#x201c;bandage&#x201d; approach like medicine applied to a wound, proper nutrition changes the course of disease at its source: tissue structure. No therapy or drug known to modern medical science can rebuild tissue that has been damaged by disease or trauma. Food alone can accomplish this feat. It is for this reason that nutrition is an indispensable weapon against disease.</p><p>But the story of nutrition is not simply one of cure. It is also a story of life-enrichment and well-being. Sadly, many people are living at only 50 percent of their full health potential, not really sick, but not truly well either. These people need to understand that the same foods that heal by rebuilding damaged tissue will enhance wellness by increasing the efficiency and energy level of underactive endocrine glands, and all other organs, glands, and tissues&#x2014;including the skin, the muscles, the nerves, the joints, the veins, and the arteries. The message is clear: You can feel wonderful&#x2014;if you will simply eat healthful foods and avoid harmful foods.</p><p>For 55 of my 80 years, my life has centered on the application of foods to healing and wellness. In this book, I discuss all I&#x2019;ve learned about nutrition, healing, and wellness so that you will have an opportunity to enjoy your own life and health as I am enjoying mine.</p><p>Chapter One of this book is dedicated to a discussion of the great physician Hippocrates&#x2019; influence on modern health care from a nutritional standpoint. Before Hippocrates&#x2019; lifetime during Greece&#x2019;s Golden Age, health care was still a hodgepodge of superstitious rituals. Indeed, after his time, much of the medical knowledge he gave Western civilization sank back into obscurity for centuries. (Some claim the nutritional knowledge he pioneered remains there still.) Hippocrates was probably the first physician to employ observation, analysis, and practical procedures such as diet change to promote healing in his patients. In addition, this greatest of physicians was committed to ethics in the physician-patient relationship. I use many of Hippocrates&#x2019; practices and principles in my own work.</p><p>Though less well-known than Hippocrates, Dr. Victor G. Rocine was equally influential in my work. Rocine emigrated from Norway to the United States after studying the work of pioneer European food chemists&#x2014;work that had not yet been introduced to this country. To Rocine, all illness and disease could be traced to either nutrient deficiencies or excesses in the human body. Rocine &#x201c;rediscovered&#x201d; the preventive approach to disease first advocated by Hippocrates more than 2,000 years before. For this reason, I have dedicated Chapter Two to the work of Rocine.</p><p>Much of Chapters One and Two comes from the original works of Hippocrates and Dr. Rocine.</p><p>The impact of these two great teachers on my own work is discussed in detail in Chapter Three, a discussion of my work in the health arts. A brief concluding chapter suggests how to get started making changes.</p><p>Following Part One&#x2019;s narrative chapters, which deal with the basis of my work, I have included Part Two, entitled <i>A Guide to Fruits and Vegetables.</i> This section will provide you with a handy home reference guide to the actions and importance of scores of foods. I am sure you will find it a valuable tool to gain better understanding about the way foods can help us and heal us. Combined with the knowledge in Part One, it is my hope that this book as a whole will serve as a nutritional source book to guide you and your family towards better health.</p><p>Part One</p><p>Three Pathways to Health</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;Let food be thy medicine.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p><i>&#x2013;Hippocrates circa 431 B.C.</i></p><p></p><p>1.</p><p>Hippocrates and His Work</p><p><b>I</b>t is because Hippocrates laid the cornerstone for modern medical and nutritional science that I discuss his work here first. I have been fascinated with the teaching of Hippocrates for as long as I can remember. The reason is not only that he believed in foods and natural cure, but also that he was committed to serving his fellow man, and that he applied wisdom and integrity to his art. In other words, I like his philosophy as well as his methods.</p><p>Hippocrates believed in the power of positive thinking. &#x201c;Some patients, though conscious that their condition is perilous, recover their health simply through their contentment with the goodness of the physician,&#x201d; he wrote.</p><p>Over the years I have found, as Hippocrates taught, that my relationship with patients is just as important as the attention I give to their health. This is because when people trust you, they seem to get well more consistently. But the physician&#x2019;s concern must be genuine, Hippocrates wisely observed. For the patient will only trust the physician fully when he or she feels the physician is giving his very best.</p><p>Hippocrates taught that the physician must be full of personal integrity. &#x201c;Sometimes give your services for nothing,&#x201d; Hippocrates advised his students. &#x201c;Unless the doctor values doing what is right more than he values money, the ideal of service to humanity is corrupted and the high purpose of the health art is compromised.&#x201d;</p><p>Called the Father of Medicine by historians, Hippocrates is believed to have been born on the Greek island of Cos around 460 B.C. One biographer suggests he was practicing medicine by 431 B.C., at the age of 29. Historians believe that Hippocrates continued practicing his art well into his eighties, to about 377 B.C., traveling to various parts of the Greek world.</p><p>The real greatness of Hippocrates was not only in turning the healing arts away from magic and superstition to a more scientific approach, but in recognizing that therapy must be consistent with nature and the design of the human body. He knew that effective health care could not be separated from nutrition as part of the therapy. Because he has been widely respected through the ages, some of his writings, such as the <i>Aphorisms,</i> were used in medical schools throughout the world until as recently as the 1800s. Curiously, however, Hippocr...</p></p><h2>Games and Decisions: Introduction and Critical Survey (Dover Books on Mathematics)</h2><p>Superb non-technical introduction to game theory, primarily applied to social sciences.

On this journey stretching from the southern tip of Japan to the bottom of Grand Canyon, and into the ugliest aspects of human behavior, Pure Land offers proof of the healing power of nature and of the resiliency of the human spirit.<br>Tomomi Hanamure, a Japanese citizen who loved exploring the rugged wilderness of the American West, was killed on her birthday May 8, 2006. She was stabbed 29 times as she hiked to Havasu Falls on the Havasupai Indian Reservation at the bottom of Grand Canyon. Her killer was an 18-year old Havasupai youth named Randy Redtail Wescogame who had a history of robbing tourists and was addicted to meth. It was the most brutal murder ever recorded in Grand Canyon's history. Annette McGivney covered the tragedy for Backpacker magazine where she is Southwest Editor and she wrote an award-winning article that received more reader mail than any story in the last decade.<br> <br> While the assignment ended when the article was published, McGivney could not let go of the story. As a woman who also enjoys wilderness hiking, McGivney felt a bond with Hanamure and embarked on a years-long pursuit to learn more about her. McGivney traveled to Japan and across the American West following the trail Hanamure left in her journals. Yet, McGivney also had a connection to Wescogame, Hanamure's killer, and her reporting unexpectedly triggered long-buried memories about violent abuse McGivney experienced as a child.<br>Pure Land is a story of this inner and outer journey, how two women in search of their true nature found transcendence in the West's most spectacular landscapes. It is also a tale of how child abuse leads to violence and destroys lives. And it is, ultimately, a story of healing. While chronicling Hanamure's life landed McGivney in the crime scene of her own childhood, it was her connection to Hanamure---a woman she did not know until after Hanamure died--that helped McGivney find a way out of her own horror.</p><p>When I took an assignment covering a murder in Grand Canyon, I thought it would be challenging but nothing I couldn't handle after dozens of previous assignments for <i>Backpacker</i> magazine. I was wrong. The assignment pulled me down a frightening tunnel where I not only explored the reasons behind the murder of a hiker but also unexpectedly stumbled upon the darkest secrets I had been keeping from myself most of my life. What was supposed to be a few months of reporting turned into a decade-long quest. I came out on the other end completely transformed, humbled and a more content and joyful person. <i>Pure Land </i>is my story of this journey. I am sharing my experience in the hope that it will help others who have been impacted by family violence.Annette McGivney is an award-winning journalist and the longtime Southwest Editor for <i>Backpacker</i> magazine.

Also in this volume: Lucy creates an educational slideshow of Charlie Brown&#x2019;s faults (it&#x2019;s so long there&#x2019;s an intermission!) and Snoopy&#x2019;s doghouse begins its conceptual expansion (the ceiling is so huge that Linus can paint a vast &#x201c;history of civilization&#x201d; mural on it). Introduction by Bill Melendez, animator of A Charlie Brown Christmas.</p><p><strong>Charles M. Schulz</strong> was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip <em>Barney Google</em>).<br><br> In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 <em>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</em> installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>&#x2015;as well as, to the local <em>St. Paul Pioneer Press</em>, a weekly comic feature called <em>Li'l Folks</em>. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.<br><br> He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, <em>Li'l Folks</em>. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become <em>Peanuts</em>&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first <em>Peanuts</em> daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.<br><br> Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from <em>Peanuts</em> at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.&#x201c;I am genuinely thrilled that this series has reached the 1990s, which I consider one of Charles Schulz's artistic peaks, with his poignantly shaky line and boldly irreverent storylines invigorating the timeless strip.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jake Austen, <em>Chicago Tribune</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Schulz&#x2019;s cartooning is still excellent here, the facial expressions telling, the choreography of his characters elegant. ... In this latest collection it&#x2019;s pure pleasure to savor a true master writing and drawing a few years before his death. Schulz&#x2019;s work didn&#x2019;t decline &#x2015; the culture simply sped up and forgot to look back.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dana Jennings, <em>The New York Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;These timeless strips are sure to bring a smile to your face....If you could use a relaxing, funny way to end the day,&nbsp;<em>The Complete Peanuts 1993 to 1994</em>&nbsp;makes for good bedtime reading!&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Glenn Perrett, <em>Metroland Media</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The volume covering 1993 and 1994 still has plenty of good ideas and great gags. Schulz is at his best when doing stories about baseball. It's Charlie Brown at his purest, as an idealist and optimist who never stops trying, no matter how many times he's failed. ... The strips set at camp are always strong, but the series where Snoopy's in the hospital were unusually touching.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Rob Clough, <em>High-Low</em></strong></p><h2>Learn to Study the Bible</h2><p>Pastor Andy Deane&#39;s new book teaches you forty different step-by-step Bible study methods to help you discover, apply and enjoy God&#39;s Word. Each practical method has a handwritten example to demonstrate it and make it easy for you to follow the steps. Learn how to study the Bible with so much variety that you&#39;ll never get into the rut that routine brings ever again. Learn to Study the Bible has more Bible study methods than any other book out there!</p><p><b>More Bible Study Methods Than Any Other Book!</b><br> No other resource provides the large variety of Bible study methods, how-to illustrations, and study aids that are available in this one book. The hundreds of hours spent researching and proving these forty methods will enable you to find one that will fit your goals and begin enhancing your understanding of God's Word, today. Whether you are a teenager or a mature Bible student, a Sunday school teacher or a pastor, a stay at home mom or a busy executive: you will find in the pages of this book, a number of Bible study methods that will add excitement and enjoyment to your study of God's Word. In addition, you will have resources at your fingertips that will help you to train and encourage others who want to learn how to dig into the Scriptures as well. <br><br><b>Why Use a Method to Study the Bible?</b><br> Why do we need a method to study the Bible; isn't it enough to have a desire to know God's Word as we simply read the Scriptures? While a desire to know God's Word is an absolutely, necessary motivation, unless we have a plan to act upon, we are bound to fail. A Bible study method is a plan. So, each of the forty methods in this book provides a different plan that will help you to think through the passages you are reading. They will allow you to slow down and patiently and prayerfully reflect upon the Scripture you are studying. Each method provides questions to answer, charts to fill out, and a variety of other ideas on how to draw the most from your time in God's Word. <br><br>Each chapter in this book contains step-by-step instructions for a study method that you can immediately begin applying to your Bible reading. I would encourage you to try each of the forty methods at least once. They will teach you new ways to approach both difficult and familiar passages and help you to absorb more of their meaning.<b>Why Pastor Andy Deane Wrote This Book</b><br> This project came about after what I thought was going to be a fairly simple task of teaching a group of junior high students a few basic inductive Bible study principles that would help them to dig into the Word on a daily basis. The class wasn't forced upon them; they wanted to learn how to study the Bible for themselves. So, I agreed to share some of what I have learned about studying the Scriptures with them. I even threw in some clever (or at least I thought so) illustrations and examples that teenage minds could relate to, in an attempt to make the class fun and memorable. But to my surprise, after forty minutes they were actually worse off then when we began; all I had to show for my effort was a room full of frustrated and confused teenagers. <br><br>The collective look of bewilderment on their faces was one of the scariest moments I've ever had as a youth pastor. However, the worst part of all was that I accomplished the exact opposite of what I had set out to do: instead of getting them excited about studying the Bible, they left feeling as though it was totally out of their reach. <br><br>What a disaster! I quickly realized that the biggest mistakes I made were:<br> 1) Trying to teach them a method of Bible study that was too complicated for them to grasp.<br> 2) Presenting it to them as if it was the only way to study Scripture. <p>I was determined to right this wrong, but first I needed to do a little research. So, I began to look for the perfect Bible study method - one that would open their young minds to the greatness of the Bible. <br><br>A personal quest began to grow out of my utter failure. Every day I searched for new study methods that would unlock God's Word. I read over thirty books (many out of print) and visited countless websites looking for the best Bible study methods. None of the ones I found were perfect, but many of them had interesting points of view and seemed like they would be fun to try. So I did. That is when I began to realize that I was onto something more than I anticipated at the start. My search resulted in not one, but numerous inspiring and challenging Bible study methods suitable for any Christian, young or old, who desires to draw nearer to the Lord through studying His Word. <br><br>In the end, I had compiled a list of forty different step-by-step Bible study methods. I tested each of them myself, improving upon some in order to make them a little more efficient and to the point. As I was doing the work, a desire to share my discoveries with others began growing in my heart.

Meanwhile he has taken on the murder investigation of a young black girl found dead in the Bayou swamp - a case no one seems keen for him to investigate. But Robicheaux persists and uncovers a web of corruption that some would kill to protect, leading him to a terrifying confrontation with the one horror he fears most of all.</p><p>James Lee Burke is the author of many previous novels, many featuring Detective Dave Robicheaux.

The anti-capital-punishment crowd -- priests, nuns in lay clothes, kids from LSU with burning candles cupped in their hands -- were praying outside the fence. But another group was there too -- a strange combination of frat boys and rednecks -- drinking beer from Styrofoam coolers filled with cracked ice; they were singing "Glow, Little Glow Worm," and holding signs that read THIS BUD IS FOR YOU, MASSINA AND JOHNNY, START YOUR OWN SIZZLER FRANCHISE TODAY. </p><p> "I'm Lieutenant Dave Robicheaux, New Orleans police department," I said to one of the guards on the gate. I opened my badge for him. </p><p> "Oh yeah, Lieutenant. I got your name on my clipboard. I'll ride with you up to the Block," he said, and got in my car. His khaki sleeves were rolled over his sunburned arms, and he had the flat green eyes and heavy facial bones of north Louisiana hill people. He smelled faintly of dried sweat, Red Man, and talcum powder. "I don't know which bunch bothers me worse. Those religious people act like we're frying somebody for a traffic citation, and those boys with the signs must not be getting much pussy over at the university. You staying for the whole thing?" </p><p> "Nope." </p><p> "Did you nail this guy or something?" </p><p> "He was just a low-level button man I used to run in once in a while. I never got him on anything. In fact, I think he screwed up more jobs than he pulled off. Maybe he got into the mob through Affirmative Action." </p><p> The guard didn't laugh. He looked out the window at the huge, flat expanse of the prison farm, his eyes narrowing whenever we passed a trusty convict walking along the dirt road. The main living area of the prison, a series of two-story, maximum-security dormitories contained within a wire fence and connected by breezeways and exercise yards and collectively called the Block, was as brilliantly lit as cobalt in the rain, and in the distance I could see the surgically perfect fields of sugar cane and sweet potatoes, the crumbling ruins of the nineteenth-century camps silhouetted against the sun's red afterglow, the willows bent in the breeze along the Mississippi levee, under which many a murdered convict lay buried. </p><p> "They still keep the chair in the Red Hat House?" I said. </p><p> "You got it. That's where they knock the fire out their ass. You know how the place come by that name?" </p><p> "Yes," I said, but he wasn't listening. </p><p> "Back before they started putting the mean ones in lockdown in the Block, they worked them down by the river and made them wear striped jumpers and these red-painted straw hats. Then at night they stripped them down, body-searched them, then run them into the Red Hat House and threw their clothes in after them. There wasn't no screens on the windows, and them mosquitoes would make a Christian out of a man when a baseball bat couldn't." </p><p> I parked the car and we entered the Block, passed through the first lockdown area, where both the snitches and the dangerous ones stayed, walked down the long, brilliantly lit breezeway between the recreation yards into the next dormitory, passed through another set of hydraulic locks and a dead space where two hacks sat at a table playing cards and where a sign overhead read no guns beyond this point, into the rec and dining halls where the black trustees were running electric waxers on the gleaming floors, and finally walked up the spiral iron steps to a small maximum-security corner where Johnny Massina was spending the last three hours of his life. </p><p> The guard from the gate left me, and another one pulled the single lever that slid back the cell door. Johnny wore a white shirt, a pair of black slacks, and black Air Force shoes with white socks. His wiry gray and black hair was dripping with sweat, and his face was the color and texture of old paper. He looked up at me from where he was seated on his bunk, and his eyes were hot and bright and moisture was beaded across his upper lip. He held a Camel cigarette between his yellowed fingers, and the floor around his feet was covered with cigarette butts. </p><p> "Streak, I'm glad you come. I didn't know if you were going to make it," he said. </p><p> "How you doing, Johnny?" </p><p> His hands clutched his thighs and he looked at the floor, then back at me. I saw him swallow. </p><p> "How scared you ever been?" he said. </p><p> "In Vietnam I had some moments." </p><p> "That's right. You were over there, weren't you?" </p><p> "Way back in '64, before it got real hot." </p><p> "I bet you were a good soldier." </p><p> "I was just a live one, that's all." </p><p> I felt instantly stupid at my remark. He saw the regret in my face. </p><p> "Don't worry about it," he said. "I got a whole bunch of shit to tell you. Look, you remember when you took me to a couple of those AA meets, that step you guys take when you want to confess something, what'd you call it?" </p><p> "Step Five, admitting to yourself, God, and somebody else the exact nature of your faults." </p><p> "That's it. Well, I done it. To a colored preacher, yesterday morning. I told him every bad thing I ever done." </p><p> "That's good, Johnny." </p><p> "No, you listen. I told him the truth and I come clean with some really heavy shit, sexual things I always been ashamed of and I never understood. You know what I mean? I didn't keep nothing back. I also told him about the two guys I whacked in my life. I dumped one guy over the rail of a passenger liner on the way to Havana, and in 1958 I took out Bugsy Siegel's cousin with a shotgun. You know what it means to ice a relative of Bugsy Siegel? After I confessed it to the preacher, I told the guard and the assistant warden about it. You know these dumb cocksuckers couldn't care less? </p><p> "Wait a minute, let me finish. I told all this stuff because somebody's got to believe I didn't snuff that broad. I wouldn't throw no young girl out a hotel window, Streak. I got no kick coming about being fried. I figure it all comes out even in the end, but I want these bastards to know I only pushed the button on guys that played by the same rules I did. Can you relate to that?" </p><p> "I think so. I'm glad you did a fifth step, too, Johnny." </p><p> He smiled for the first time. His face glistened in the light. "Hey, tell me something. Is it true Jimmie the Gent is your brother?" </p><p> "You hear a lot of bullshit in the street." </p><p> "You both got that black Cajun hair with a white patch in it, like you got skunk blood in you." He laughed. His mind was now moving away from the ride he would take in three hours, manacled in a waist chain, to the Red Hat House. "Once he contracted us for some poker machines for his places. After we put them in we told him he gets all his machines from us -- cigarettes, Pac-Man, and rubbers. So he says no rubbers, he's got class clubs and he don't put rubber machines in them. So we tell him he don't have a choice, he either buys the whole line or he don't get linen service, the Teamsters put a picket up on his sidewalk, and the parish health office finds out his dishwashers got leprosy. So what's he do? He invites Didoni Giacano -- Didi Gee himself -- and his whole family for lasagna at his restaurant, and they arrive on Sunday afternoon like a bunch of <i>cafoni</i> that just got off the boat from Palermo, because Didi thinks Jimmie has got respectable connections and is going to get him into the Knights of Columbus or something. Didi Gee probably weighs three hundred pounds and he's covered with hair like an animal and he scares the crap out of everybody in downtown New Orleans, but his mama is this little dried-up Sicilian lady that looks like a mummy wrapped in black rags and she still hits Didi on the hands with a spoon when he reaches across the table and don't ask. </p><p> "So in the middle of dinner Jimmie starts telling Mama Giacano what a great guy Didi Gee is, how everybody down at the Chamber of Commerce and Better Business Bureau think he's a big plus for the city, and how Didi don't let anybody push his friends around. For example, he says, some scumbags tried to put some machines in Jimmie's restaurants that Jimmie, a Catholic man, don't want. Mama Giacano might look like she's made out of dried-up pasta, but her hot little black eyes tell everybody she knows what he's talking about. Then Jimmie says Didi tore them machines out, smashed them up with hammers, and run a truck up and down on them behind the restaurant. </p><p> "Didi Gee's got a mouthful of beer and raw oysters and almost chokes to death. He's spitting glop all over his plate, his kids are beating him on the back, and he coughs up an oyster that could plug a sewer main. Mama Giacano waits till his face ain't purple anymore, then tells him she didn't raise her son to eat like a herd of pigs and says he should go wash </p><p> out his mouth in the bathroom because everybody else at the table is getting sick looking at him, and when he don't get up right away she busts him across the knuckles with her spoon. Then Jimmie says he wants to take the whole family out on his sailboat and maybe Didi Gee ought to join the Yacht Club, too, because all these millionaires think he's a swell guy, and besides, Mama Giacano would really love the Italian-American celebrations they have on the Fourth of July and Columbus Day. And even if Didi don't join, which everybody knows he won't because he hates water and pukes his guts out just crossing the Mississippi ferry, Jimmie is going to drive out and get Mama Giacano whenever she wants and sail her all around Lake Pontchartrain." </p><p> He laughed again and ran his hand through his wet hair. He licked his lips and shook his head, and I saw the fear come back into his eyes. </p><p> "I bet he already told you that story, didn't he?" he said. </p><p> "They didn't give me too long, Johnny. Is there something else you wanted to tell me?" </p><p> "Yeah, there is. You always treated me decent and I thought maybe I could repay you a little bit." He wiped the sweat out of his eyes with the flat of his fingers. "I think maybe I got some heavy dues to pay on the other side, too. It don't hurt to try to square what you can now, does it?" </p><p> "You don't owe me." </p><p> "A guy with my track record owes the whole fucking earth. Anyway, here's the deal. Yesterday this punk by the name of L. J. Potts from Magazine Street is pushing a broom out in the corridor, clacking it against my bars and making all kinds of noise so I can't sleep. So I say I ain't working on the Good Housekeeping Award and would this punk take his broom somewhere else before I get my hands on it and shove it up his hole. So the punk, who's got a brother named Wesley Potts, tries to impress me. He asks if I know a New Orleans homicide roach named Robicheaux, and he's smirking, see, because he thinks you're one of the cops that nailed me. I tell him maybe, and he keeps smirking and says, well, here's some good news because his brother Wesley has it that this particular homicide roach has stuck his nose in the wrong place and if he don't stop it he's going to get whacked." </p><p> "He sounds like a gasbag, Johnny." </p><p> "Yeah, he probably is, except the difference with him and his brother is I think they're connected up with the greasers." </p><p> "The Colombians?" </p><p> "Fucking A. They're spreading around the country faster than AIDS. They'll take out anybody, too -- whole families, the children, the old people, it don't matter to them. You remember that bar on Basin that got torched? The greaser that did it stood in the doorway in broad daylight with a fucking flamethrower on his back and because he was in a good mood he gave everybody one minute to get out of the place before he melted it into a big pile of bubbling plastic. You watch out for those cocksuckers, Streak." </p><p> He lit a fresh Camel from the butt in his hand. He was sweating heavily now, and he wiped his face on his sleeve and smelled himself simultaneously. Then his face got gray and still and he stared straight ahead with his palms gripped on his thighs. </p><p> "You better leave now. I think I'm going to get sick again," he said. </p><p> "I think you're a stand-up guy, Johnny." </p><p> "Not on this one." </p><p> We shook hands. His hand was slick and light in mine.<br> </p><p> They electrocuted Johnny Massina at midnight. Back in my houseboat on Lake Pontchartrain, with the rain beating on the roof and dancing on the water outside, I remembered the lines I had heard sung once by a black inmate in Angola:<br> </p><p> <i>I ax my bossman, Bossman, tell me what's right.<br> He whupped my left, said, Boy, now you know what's right.<br> I wonder why they burn a man twelve o'clock hour at night.<br> The current much stronger; the peoples turn out all the light.</i><br> </p><p> My partner was Cletus Purcel. Our desks faced each other in a small room in the old converted fire station on Basin Street. Before the building was a fire station it had been a cotton warehouse, and before the Civil War slaves had been kept in the basement and led up the stairs into a dirt ring that served both as an auction arena and a cockfighting pit. </p><p> Cletus's face looked like it was made from boiled pigskin, except there were stitch scars across the bridge of his nose and through one eyebrow, where he'd been bashed by a pipe when he was a kid in the Irish Channel. He was a big man, with sandy hair and intelligent green eyes, and he fought to keep his weight down, unsuccessfully, by pumping iron four nights a week in his garage. </p><p> "Do you know a character named Wesley Potts?" I asked. </p><p> "Christ, yes. I went to school with him and his brothers. What a family. It was like having bread mold as your next-door neighbor." </p><p> "Johnny Massina said this guy's talking about pulling my plug." </p><p> "Sounds like bullshit to me. Potts is a gutless lowlife. He runs a dirty movie house on Bourbon. I'll introduce you to him this afternoon. You'll really enjoy this guy." </p><p> "I've got his file right here. Two narcotics, six obscenity busts, no convictions. Evidently one serious beef with the IRS." </p><p> "He fronts points for the greasers." </p><p> "That's what Massina said." </p><p> "All right, we'll go talk to him after lunch. You notice I say 'after lunch,' because this guy is your real genuine bucket of shit. By the way, the parish coroner in Cataouatche returned your call and said they didn't do an autopsy on that colored girl." </p><p> "What do you mean, they didn't do one?" I said. </p><p> "He said they didn't do one because the sheriff's office didn't request it. It went down as a drowning. What's all this about, anyway, Dave? Don't you have enough open cases without finding work down in Cataouatche Parish? Those people down there don't follow the same rules we do, anyway. You know that." </p><p> Two weeks before, I had been fishing in a pirogue on Bayou Lafourche, flycasting popping-bugs along the edge of the lily pads that grew out from the banks. The shore was thickly lined with cypress trees, and it was cool and quiet in the green-gold morning light that fell through the c...</p></p><h2>P.S.

"Yes, no!" "Stop, go!" "I never lie, I was just protecting you from the truth!" <i>What does he mean?</i> The King of Hearts and most passive-aggressive men share the maddening characteristic of never saying exactly what they mean.<br><br>He may be a legal wizard, a computer genius, a brilliant analytical scientist or a guy who runs a newsstand, but when it comes to relating to others, the passive-aggressive man has just learned to read. <i>He's</i> as unclear about why he does what he does as you are about his behavior.<br><br>When patients describe his psychological abuse, they often begin the same way: "This guy is <i>impossible."</i> "This guy is <i>difficult."</i> "Every meal, every conversation and everything we decide to do is handled like we' re two warring nations negotiating a pact, not two people who care about each other," one woman told me. She could be talking for other women about their husbands, fathers, bosses, the shoemaker.<br><br>What's the appeal of a guy who says in one breath, "I love you/I hate you," or, "I promise.../Why should I do anything for you?" If you have any emotional investment in a passive-aggressive man, it's because you've probably fallen for his salesmanship. He's brilliantly persuasive at selling himself -- whether it's his brooding stoicism, his understated charm, his boyishness or irresistible seductiveness. You buy into his elusiveness; but you also buy into his <i>neediness.</i> You feel for him and want to be the one who breaks through, who tears the walls down and gets him to shape up. In many cases, it is a thankless mission.<br><br>Problems arise with the passive-aggressive man because of his fatal flaw: an indirect and inappropriate way of expressing hostility hidden under the guise of innocence, generosity or passivity. If what he says or does confuses you, or, more likely, angers you, this is why. You're not the only one to react this way. It's what passive-aggression is all about.<br><br>INSIDE PASSIVE-AGGRESSION<br><br>A seemingly paradoxical term, passive-aggression asks the question, How can a person be passive <i>and</i> aggressive, rather than one way or the other? It's a common misconception about passive-aggression that its perpetrators swing alternately between the two behaviors -- either willfully with premeditation to control others (aggression) or in a self-effacing manner (passivity).<br><br>The truth is that the passive-aggressive man doesn't ride an emotional seesaw (although he may put you on one); he's not passive today and aggressive tomorrow, depending on the circumstances. Rather, the passive-aggressive man is simultaneously passive and aggressive. The paradox reigns because he <i>renounces his aggression as it is happening.</i><br><br>Since passivity and aggression are contradictory by origin and act, you can see that we are dealing with a complex and fundamentally ambivalent creature.<br><br>Passive-aggressive tactics aren't that easily read at first; it takes a while to figure out what this guy is getting at: the blur of meaning lies in his genius for creating discrepancies between how he pretends to be and how he acts, which is a better indicator of his true intentions and feelings. You're always receiving mixed messages because he wants you to guess what he wants almost as much as he wants to fool you or string you along. This is what his double-speak can sound like:<br><br>-- "I can't live without you," a passive-aggressive boyfriend says as he kisses you and leaves the room. Or, when the two of you are alone, he asks "Why are you around all the time?" when he means, <i>I'm terrified that you'll leave me.</i><br><br>-- "Are you interested...?" a passive-aggressive husband may whisper to a wife who makes an affectionate advance toward him, while what he is really thinking is, <i>Why am I asking her when I'm not that turned on?</i> Or he says, contrarily, "Sometimes sex is overrated," when he means, <i>I want you,</i> all the while expecting his wife to know that he wants to be seduced.<br><br>-- "We've noticed your administrative skills and would like to discuss a special project that's coming up," a passive-aggressive boss says flatteringly, hinting at a promotion, but then you never hear from him again. What he really meant was: <i>What makes you think I'd even consider you for that secret project, and how'd you find out about it anyway?</i><br><br>Or, he might try a version of this empty promise:<br><br>-- "Okay, I know I promised to pick up your kitchen stuff at Sue's place, but my car broke down. Maybe tomorrow..." a passive-aggressive brother assures you, but he's thinking, <i>Why do you keep asking me to do anything involving Sue when you know I can't stand the sight of her, and besides, I hate hauling freight in my new car.</i><br><br>-- Or, a passive-aggressive friend says, "I wanted to be the first one to buy you a disk for your new CD player...something <i>really</i> great, something you'll love -- eighteenth-century harpsichord favorites that took me a week to find for you," but what he thinks is, <i>This should let you know how low-brow your taste in music is. Your idea of culture is the Miami Sound Machine.</i><br><br>The man in each of these examples isn't playing diplomat; his baiting behavior isn't <i>inadvertent,</i> though he hopes you'll think it is. This is a man who's driven to appear above suspicion, guiltless and guileless. That's why you find that most passive-aggressive men negotiate the world as "nice guys" denying even the slightest hint of hostility or conflict.<br><br>As with a brother who'll easily break a promise five or ten times rather than just say, "No, sorry, I can't," this man will lie to keep you on a string until the game reaches its limit and he's finally forced -- by you -- to confess that he can't come through. If he's someone who's been in your life a long time, you may find you're always arguing about the same thing, year after year. Most of all, you wonder why you still jump through the same flaming hoops he holds up, how he can still get a rise out of you.<br><br>If you're typical, and at the end of your rope with him, you may fantasize about ending your relationship -- and this includes abandoning relationships with "impossible" relatives, like fathers and brothers. But you don't act on it. Or, if he's a key player sorely affecting your job, you might just give up and quit, but the passive-aggressive colleague you leave behind won't believe he's done anything to obstruct your career. More likely, he expects a huge pat on the back for <i>doing everything</i> to boost your efforts and calls you ungrateful, to boot.<br><br>Whoever he is, your relationship with a passive-aggressive man probably leaves you feeling unsettled and insecure, wondering why you're always at an emotional crossroad. Most of all, you wonder how to make your life with him a better place to be. Before I get to the latter, I'll take you through what makes him tick and keeps him running. The passive-aggressive man's <i>modus operandi</i> has two primary component parts: passivity and aggression. Let's begin there.<br><br>A CLOSE LOOK AT PASSIVITY<br><br>When it's used as a power play against you, <i>passivity</i> can rouse you to anger just as much as an active display of hostility. But why does someone's <i>in</i>action so anger you?<br><br>The answer lies in the qualities that make up "passivity." Traditionally, a passive person shows little initiative in getting what he wants; assertion is a labor and comes about hesitantly, if at all. Male passivity covers a wide range of behavior, from the classic "loser" -- the weak, inept type who has a hard time keeping a job -- to the "conformist" -- the man who rolls with the current, buoyed by approval seeking, not making waves, changing his opinions in order to be liked and rarely stating what he feels and thinks at any moment.<br><br>In certain corporate or bureaucratic circles, he's the yesman. On occasion, his quick-change sentiments delivered to the right person at the right time may serve to get him what he wants. As <i>a guy who just wants to fit in,</i> he may reach some level of success, but he's a poor leader and decision maker; he avoids big responsibilities, and he'll stop short of a top spot. As he sees it, others are better able to make the right decisions.<br><br><i>"This man's a baby.</i> He's sharp, he's charming, but emotionally, he's about four years old!" women say, and they're right. Passive people -- and here I include women, too -- all suffer because they haven't quite grown up. They're childlike and continue to rely on others.<br><br>Larry is a good example of passive dependency. An engineer in the construction business, he can never remember to bring cash, check, or credit card when he goes out to dinner. It isn't that Larry is cheap; rather, he has a compulsion to get others to pay for his meal -- he needs you to feed him. His excuses take the same unrealistic and juvenile line of thinking as, "The dog ate my term paper." You don't believe Larry's story, but it is that boyish, ingratiating look -- that need to be loved and forgiven -- that suckers certain of us who take to babying him.<br><br>That Larry needs to be "nurtured" by someone with money -- that is, an adult with power -- makes him passive; that he has to <i>trick</i> you into doing it makes him <i>passive-aggressive.</i><br><br>You'll find that passive men and the more complicated passive-aggressive men have a trait in common: both are reluctant to assert themselves directly, in a firm but tactful way. They shun and fear <i>self-assertion,</i> mistaking it for unleashed aggression. The consequences of assertion scare them. Their internal line of thinking goes something like this: "If I do this, straight out and simply, I'm telling you what I think, what I'm going to do or what I feel. This leaves me open to a possible challenge, disagreement or loss of support."<br><br>This emotion-packed reasoning haunts them: If asserting themselves brings them into direct confrontation with others, what will happen next? Could they handle an attack? Self-doubt tells them they would not be able to, so they do what they can to avoid confrontation, winding and weaving all over the map. To passive and passive-aggressive personalities, denial and avoidance offer a safe haven. This is one reason why the roads in a passive-aggressive man's life lead to detours, dead ends or clover-leaf turns that circle back to the starting point: going <i>forward</i> puts him on his bumpiest road.<br><br>The passive-aggressive man pretends to be passive, when he's not that way at all. What underlies his apparent passivity -- his fear and dependency -- is aggression, pure and simple. And this is what rouses you to anger, makes you feel tricked. The passive personality is never infuriating because he poses no challenge; the passive-aggressive personality, however, is constantly giving you little tastes of his hostility in doses just large enough to irritate you.<br><br><i>Aggression</i> is the other side of the issue. While passivity brings out restraint, inhibition, and a life without much challenge or "juice," aggression evokes images of force, energy and push. Together they add up to a mixed-up view of his power as a man.<br><br>A CLOSE LOOK AT AGGRESSION<br><br>Aggression, a basic drive older than predawn man, is often thought of as man's failing -- a dubious impulse equated with hostility, tyranny, anger, dominance and bloodshed. Yet aggression exists within a wide range of experience, and everyone is motivated to some degree by aggressive impulses. A masked terrorist aiming an Uzi at a planeload of tourists is one kind of riotous aggressor; a rude shopper pushing his way to the front of a line in a bakery and demanding to be served reveals another kind of unbridled nerve; pitching a set of dishes at the kitchen wall during a fight is anger with impact; and a Jets quarterback whose guts and muscle win a football game describes aggression a fourth way.<br><br>Of the two impulses, it is aggression, not passivity, that commands greater attention by social, psychological, biological, ethical and religious scholars, scientists, researchers and philosophers. Perhaps it is the power and intensity of aggression that fascinates us; it's a force that can build or destroy with equal strokes. Aggression not only makes headlines, it gets things done. Yet, those who study it unanimously view aggression as something to be contained.<br><br>The messages from social theorists, for example, reckon that aggression swims the eternal tides of our primordial gene pools -- a remnant from the days before we were civilized and prowled the earth as animals. Aggression got us dinner, shelter and mates. It still does, but now it has a civilized veneer. However, some social theorists ask, with developed forebrains and space-age technologies, do we really need such impulses? Aggression, being more destructive than constructive, undoes the fabric of society, and results in war, crime and domestic violence. Theorists say we must control aggression, and we have built jails and a criminal justice system to do it.<br><br>Ethical philosophers, concerned only with behavior (action) not thoughts (unacted-upon ideas), inject aggression into a similar vein: to them, it's immoral. Their message is: behave in a hostile manner and you'll be judged harshly and suffer guilt that will follow you through life. Theologians, whose scope reaches to an individual's innermost soul, hold aggression as sinful and goodness as holy. Their message is more damning, full of brimstone and with even less understanding of the nature of man: don't feel anger or you'll go to hell. In quite different ways, each of these theories encourages the development of passive-aggression because they discourage the individual from acknowledging, or acting upon, his anger.<br><br>Psychology offers a contrasting message: everyone has aggressive impulses and it is beneficial for the individual's mental health to express them, but we must do so appropriately. If, for example, someone less talented and less experienced than you receives the promotion at work you want, it's not a good idea to show the anger you feel in any way that would sabotage your future possibilities of getting ahead. If you want to find out why you weren't promoted, you'd have to know your boss's style, how to approach him/her, in what manner to get the information you need and to know how much to say about your disappointment at losing out. You could even use your frustration to make yourself work that much harder.<br><br>But if you're annoyed because someone just recklessly cut in front of you on a highway, then it may be more appropriate to express yourself by word or gesture. Sometimes there are consequences -- maybe the guy tries another move to rear-end you in retaliation but, more likely, he'll respond, too, by word or gesture. This kind of direct and appropriate response is better than quietly seething, doing nothing or taking it out on someone else later on.<br><br>What humanity has in common is that we're all aggressive in some way. We also share the capacity to <i>judge</i> our aggressive acts, weighing them, comparing them, scrutinizing them, containing them. Were we too pushy, too loud, too demanding, too hostile, too prone to tantrums...?<br><br>As long as we're willing to take a look at how we're being aggressive, we can <i>hope</i> to control the impulse before it becomes destructive. What makes some people aggressive personalities is how <i>frequently</i> and <i>pervasively</i> they act on...</p><h2>The Book of Legends/Sefer Ha-Aggadah: Legends from the Talmud and Midrash</h2><p>The first complete English translation of the Hebrew classic Sefer Ha-Aggadah brings to the English-speaking world the greatest and best-loved anthology of classical Rabbinic literature ever compiled. First published in Odessa in 1908-11, it was recognized immediately as a masterwork in its own right, and reprinted numerous times in Israel.<br><br>The Hebrew poet Hayim Nahman Bialik and the renowned editor Yehoshua Hana Ravnitzky, the architects of this masterful compendium, selected hundreds of texts from the Talmud and midrashic literature and arranged them thematically, in order to provide their contemporaries with easy access to the national literary heritage of the Jewish people -- the texts of Rabbinic Judaism that remain at the heart of Jewish literacy today.<br><br>Bialik and Ravnitzky chose Aggadah -- the non-legal portions of the Talmud and Midrash -- for their anthology. Loosely translated as "legends", Aggadah includes the genres of biblical exegesis, stories about biblical characters, the lives of the Talmudic era sages and their contemporary history, parables, proverbs, and folklore. A captivating melange of wisdom and piety, fantasy and satire, Aggadah is the expressive medium of the Jewish creative genius.<br><br>The arrangement of this compendium reflects the theological concerns of the Rabbinic sages: the role of Israel and the nations; God, good and evil; human relations; the world of nature; and the art of healing. Here, the reader who wants to explore traditional Jewish views on a particular subject is treated to a selection of relevant texts at his fingertips but will soon become immersed in a way of thinking, exploring, and questioning that is the hallmark of Jewish inquiry.<br><br>"Whatever the imagination can invent is found in the Aggadah," wrote the historian Leopold Zunz, "its purpose always being to teach man the ways of God." The Book of Legends/Sefer Ha-Aggadah, now available in william Braude's superbly annotated translation, enables modern Jews to experience firsthand the richness and excitement of their cultural inheritance.</p><p>To have Book of Legends/Sefer Ha-Aggadah available in English is to open to the entire English-reading world -- Jew, non-Jew, religionist, secularist -- one of the very great creations of humankind: a rich and intricately woven tapestry of tales, homilies, legends and dreams that come to us from the very roots of the imagination. What a treasure!"<p>-- Chaim Potok</p><p>"Bialik and Ravnitzky's great compendium of Rabbinic legend and homily has been an indispensable resource ever since its publication in Hebrew eight decades ago....English readers are very fortunate to be able at last to avail themselves of this extraordinary compilation."</p><p>-- Robert Alter</p><p>"In translating Bialik and Ravnitzky's incomparable thematic anthology into very readable English, William Braude, master translator of Rabbinic texts, has provided the English reader with a wonderful access to the wealth of Rabbinic interpretation and lore. This book should be a fixture in the library of every serious Jew."</p><p>-- Norman J. Cohen, Dean, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion</p><p>"Sefer Ha-Aggadah has long been one of my favorite volumes of Jewish literature. Bialik and Ravnitzky arranged topically a vast collection of Talmudic and midrashic material. Whatever one is looking for, be it stories about biblical characters or reflections on love, evil, childrearing, or healing; it is there .... A most welcome addition to the growing collection of Jewish classics now available in English translation."</p><p>-- Judith Hauptman, Associate Professor of Talmud, Jewish Theological Seminary</p><p>"Sefer Ha-Aggadah restored the prestige of the non-legal sections of the Talmud and nurtured aesthetic appreciation for one of the world's most creative and colorful literatures. I fully endorse this marvelous translation by William Braude."</p><p>-- David Weiss-Halivni, Columbia University</p><b>HAYIM NAHMAN BIALIK</b> (1873-1934) is the leading Hebrew poet of the twentieth century.

A medi�val fortress, of which various not very interesting records were to be found in the muniment room, now used by Mr Theodore Frant as an office, had previously stood upon the site; and such portions of the ancient building as had survived the passage of time had been incorporated into the Tudor manor which had succeeded the fortress. Later generations had enlarged and beautified the structure much as their fancies dictated, any difficulty of adding to the mansion being overcome by the designing of another court. The Frant who survived friendship with Bluff King Hal scandalized his generation by the lavish use of oak for wainscoting; his grandson, having enjoyed the advantages of travel, built a new wing, and embellished the old with gildings and painted ceilings; a later Frant, succumbing to the prevailing fashion, ran riot in the rococo style, created the Fountain Court, and was prevented only by death from attempting something of a still more grandiose conception; his heir, one of Mr Walpole's more fervid adherents, reverted to the Gothick, and by the time an unlucky fall at a regular stitcher, when out with the Old Club, put a period to his career, nowhere in England could have been found such massive doors of oak, such ponderous iron latches, so many pointed, narrow windows, as at Stanyon.</p> <p>The sixth Earl of St Erth, possibly thinking that his principal seat already sprawled over too much ground, more probably prevented from adding a wing in the Palladian style by the straitened times in which he had the ill-fortune to live, contented himself with rebuilding the stables, papering a great many of the rooms, and installing a closed-stove in the enormous kitchen. This was declared by an embittered valet to be the only sign of modern civilization in the entire pile; but the head-cook, mistrusting modernity, allowed it to be used merely for the boiling of vegetables by one of his underlings, while he himself continued to preside over his furnace, with its antiquated ovens, its huge spits, and its iron cauldrons. Unaccustomed guests, wandering distractedly down ill-lit galleries, discovering stairs that led only to uncharted domestic regions, and arriving, flustered and exhausted, where they had been for long attended, had been known to express astonishment that anyone should choose to live in such a rabbit-warren when he owned two other and more convenient country residences. Neither of these, it was true, could boast of Great Halls, Minstrels' Galleries, Armouries, Towers, or Moats: on the other hand, no draughts whistled down their passages; no creeping chill arose from damp walls; and their chimneys very rarely smoked.</p> <p>Neither the sixth Earl nor his second wife perceived anything amiss with Stanyon: the Earl because it was the home of his childhood, his lady because she had been bred in an even more inconvenient mansion in the bleak north, and would, in any event, have unhesitatingly bartered comfort for pomp, had she been offered a choice in the matter. The Earl's first wife had hated Stanyon. But the Earl's first wife, though admittedly a lady of birth and quite remarkable beauty, had proved herself to have been quite unworthy of the high position she was called upon to fill. Before her son was out of leading-strings, she ran away with a notorious rake. Her lord, cuckolded, betrayed, and turned into a laughing-stock, expunged her name from the family records, permitted no mention of her to be made within his walls, and scarcely thought himself avenged when he learned that she had died, three years after her flight, in conditions of distress and hardship. His steward and his housekeeper, both persons of sentiment, hoped that upon his death-bed he would remember her, and speak of her with a forgiving tongue, for it seemed to them incredible that so gentle and lovely a lady should hold no place in his heart or memory. They even indulged their fancies by supposing that his overt dislike of his elder son was caused by the secret pangs the sight of the fair boy, who was indeed the image of his mother, caused him to feel. But if the Reverend Felix Clowne, my lord's Chaplain, was to be believed, the Earl's last coherent speech, forcibly phrased if feebly uttered, was a complaint that the wine he had commanded his valet to bring to his room was corked. He had earlier bestowed his blessing upon Martin, his younger son; he had had a kind word for Theodore, his nephew; he had taken punctilious leave of his lady; he had sent proper messages to his married daughter; but the names of his first wife and of his heir had not passed his lips. Nor had his heir arrived at Stanyon to attend his death-bed, although it was certain that Mr Theodore Frant had sent a letter express to him in Flanders, warning him that his father's demise was imminent. Captain Viscount Desborough, as he then was styled, was at Mons, with his regiment, and it was conceivable that a high sense of his military duties had prevented him from applying for furlough at a moment when Napoleon was almost hourly expected to cross the frontier. But the seventh Earl, surviving a minor, but rather bloody, engagement at the village of Genappe, and a major engagement at Waterloo, still showed no disposition to return to the home of his ancestors. He sold out, but he remained on the Continent, reposing the fullest confidence in his cousin's ability to administer his estates. Not until twelve calendar months had passed since his father's death did his cousin, and the Dowager Countess, receive tidings from him that he was in England, and about to take possession of his inheritance. He wrote a very civil letter to his mother-in-law, informing her of the proposed date of his arrival at Stanyon, and enquiring in the politest way after her health, and the healths of his half-brother and sister. It was a very pretty letter, the Dowager allowed, but, she added, in unhopeful accents, his mother had had just such caressing ways, and had shown herself to be a Snake in the Bosom.</p> <p>&#x2018;I should perhaps warn you, ma'am, that my cousin will not relish animadversions upon the character of his mother,' said Mr Theodore Frant, a little tight-lipped. &#x2018;In his presence, such remarks should be spared.'</p> <p>&#x2018;My dear Theo,' responded the Dowager, &#x2018;it would be odd indeed if I were to be obliged to consult you on the observances of civility!' He bowed, and, because she cherished no ill-will towards him, she said graciously: &#x2018;Or anyone else, I am sure! In this house, Desborough or, as I must learn to call him, St Erth may be sure of every attention called for by his consequence.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Just so, ma'am,' Mr Frant said, bowing again.</p> <p>&#x2018;Providence has decreed that he should succeed to his dear father's honours,' pronounced the Dowager, thinking poorly of Providence. &#x2018;One might have supposed that military service in the Peninsula a very unhealthy locality, I understand, setting aside the chances of Violent Death in an engagement, which cannot be altogether precluded might have rendered the present occasion unnecessary. But it was not to be! Had my advice been sought, I should have considered myself bound to state that a military career, for one whom I should have had no hesitation in declaring to be far from robust, could be little short of Fatal! That, my dear Theo, I must have said, for, whatever must be my maternal feelings, if there be one thing upon which I pride myself it is my observance of my duty as a Christian! Happily, as it then seemed (though, according to the workings of an inscrutable fate, it now appears to be a circumstance of little moment), my advice was not sought. Since Lady Penistone chose to interest herself so particularly in her grandson, and my dear husband saw nothing objectionable in the connection, it was not for me to raise my voice. On her head, I said at the time, be the outcome! No doubt her ladyship is a good enough sort of a woman in her way: I do her the justice to acknowledge that she did not, as one might have feared she would, from the incurable levity of her behaviour, condone her unhappy daughter's misconduct: but if she petted and indulged Desborough from any other motive than a malicious desire to tease my poor husband I shall own myself astonished! A spiritless boy, I always thought him, with too much reserve to be pleasing. His career at Eton, you know, was quite undistinguished: a very odd sort of a soldier he must have been!'</p> <p>&#x2018;It is some years since you have seen my cousin, ma'am,' Mr Frant interposed, in a measured tone.</p> <p>&#x2018;I hope,' said the Dowager, &#x2018;I am not to be blamed for that! If Lady Penistone chose to invite the boy to stay with her during his school vacations, and my lord to acquiesce in the arrangement, I take heaven to witness that it was by no expressed wish of mine that Desborough ceased to regard Stanyon as his natural home! On every head my conscience is easy: while he was a child I did my duty towards him; and I am determined now that as no word of censure for his conduct in absenting himself from a beloved parent's obsequies shall be permitted to pass my lips, so also no mark of the respect due to the Head of the Family shall be unobserved. I shall receive him in the Hall.'</p> <p>This momentous decision being faithfully adhered to, a chilly afternoon in spring saw five persons assembled in what had once been the Great Hall of the Castle. The artistic energies of several generations had largely obliterated most of its original features, but the hammer-beams in its lofty roof remained, and a vast fireplace, made to accommodate the better part of several tree-trunks. The carved screens, having been discovered to have become worm-eaten, had been removed in a previous age, the apartment being thrown open to the vestibule, or entrance-hall, situated at right-angles to it. From this smaller apartment the Grand Staircase, erected in the latter half of the seventeenth century on a scale designed to allow some dozen persons to walk up it abreast, rose in one imposing flight to a broad half-landing, whence it branched to right and left, thus attaining the main gallery of the Castle. Several massive doors strengthened by applied iron-straps, besides the great front-door opposite to the staircase, opened on to the vestibule, a circumstance which added nothing to the comfort of the Hall, in itself a passage to a series of saloons beyond it. The heat thrown out by the logs burning in the fireplace was considerable, but was unavailing to prevent the draughts sweeping through the room. These seemed to come from all quarters, even the heavy curtains which had been drawn across the windows composing almost the entire long wall opposite the fireplace being continually stirred by them. It was dusk, and candles had been lit in the sconces as well as in the several candelabra which stood on the various tables. The little tongues of flame flickered continually, causing the wax to melt unevenly, and making it impossible for one of the persons assembled in the Hall to set the stitches in her embroidery with any degree of accuracy. Having twice changed her seat to no purpose, she folded the work, and replaced it in a tapestry-bag, drawing forth, in its stead, a prosaic piece of knitting, with which she proceeded to occupy herself, in the manner of one prepared to make the best, without comment, of adverse conditions.</p> <p>The furnishing of the Hall might have been taken as an example of the heterogeneous nature of the whole Castle, few of the pieces which it contained having been chosen with any nicety of judgment. A fine refectory table, pushed under the windows, and several carved oak chairs with wooden seats, were the only objects which bore any particular relation to their surroundings, the rest of the furniture consisting of pieces representative of every age and style, and including a modern and very ugly side-table, with a marble top, supported by brazen gryphons' heads. Two suits of armour of the surcoatless period guarded the entrance, and several shields, pikes, halberds, and gisarmes were arranged upon the wall above the high plaster mantelpiece. These were flanked by a full-length portrait of the late Earl, leaning negligently with one leg crossed over the other, against the shoulder of his horse; and a fine Battle-piece, of which the most noticeable features were the arresting figure of the commanding officer in the foreground, and the smoke issuing in woolly balls from the mouths of innumerable cannons.</p> <p>Only one of the five persons gathered round the fireplace in expectation of the Earl's arrival seemed to be conscious of the discomfort of her situation, and she made no complaint, merely shifting her chair so that the leaping flames should not scorch her face, and pinning her shawl securely across her shoulders to protect them from the cold blast from the vestibule. The Dowager Countess, regally enthroned in a wing-chair, with her feet upon a stool, was indifferent to draughts; neither her son, Martin, moodily standing before the fire, and kicking at a smouldering log, nor Mr Theodore Frant, engaged in snuffing a candle in the branch set in the centre of the refectory table, was aware of any unusual chilliness; and the Chaplain, seated at her ladyship's left hand, had long since become inured to the Spartan conditions prevailing at Stanyon, and had pronounced the gathering to be very snugly placed. This tribute earned him a gracious smile from the Dowager, who said that it had frequently been remarked that few fires gave out so fierce a heat as this one. She then desired Miss Morville, in a voice of mingled civility and condescension, to be so good as to run up to the Crimson Saloon, and to fetch from it a little hand-screen. Miss Morville at once laid aside her knitting, and departed on her errand; and, as though her absence released him from constraint, Martin looked up from his scowling scrutiny of the fire, and exclaimed: &#x2018;This is a curst business! I wish it were well over! Why must we kick our heels here, waiting on his pleasure? The lord knows we don't want him! I have a very good mind to ride over to eat my mutton with Barny!'</p> <p>His cousin looked frowningly at him for a moment, but said nothing. Another candle needed attention, and he dealt with it methodically. He was a powerfully built man, nearing his thirtieth birthday, with a resolute, rather square countenance, and a good deal of reserve in his manner. The cast of his features bore a certain resemblance to that of his young cousin's, but the likeness existed merely in the aquiline trend of the nose, the slightly heavy line of the jaw, and the set of the eyes under brows which overhung them enough to give a forbidding look to the face. The colour of his eyes was a clear, light gray, as cool and as inexpressive as lake-water; his mouth, with its firmly closed lips, betrayed no secrets, but seemed to show that its owner, besides possessing resolution of character, knew how to keep his own counsel. His address was good, and his manner had all the quiet assurance of his breeding.</p> <p>With Martin, it was otherwise. Every change of mood was reflected in his eyes, so dark a brown as to appear almost black, and in the sensitive curves of his full mouth. Six years younger than his cousin, he had not altogether thrown off the boy; and, from having been the idol of his mother and the pet of his father, he was a go...</p></p><h2>The Medium and the Light: Reflections on Religion</h2><p>Say the name Marshall McLuhan and you think of the great discover&#39;s explorations of the media. But throughout his life, McLuhan never stopped reflecting profoundly on the nature of God and worship, and on the traditions of the Church. Often other intellectuals and artists would ask him incredulously, &#34;Are you really a Catholic?&#34; He would answer, &#34;Yes, I am a Catholic, the worst kind -- a convert,&#34; leaving them more baffled than before. Here, like a golden thread lining his public utterances on the media, are McLuhan&#39;s brilliant probes into the nature of conversion, the church&#39;s understanding of media, the shape of tomorrow&#39;s church, religion and youth, and the God-making machines of the modern world. This fascinating collection, gathered from his many and scattered remarks, essays, and other writings, shows the deeply Christian side of a man widely considered the most important thinker of our time, a man whose insights into media and culture have revolutionized the field of media study and the way we see the world.</p><p></p><h2>American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us</h2><p><b><i>American Grace</i> is &#x201c;perhaps the most sweeping look yet at contemporary American religion.

DeMille for a unique promotion of the epic movie <i>The Ten Commandments</i>. In a form of reverse product placement, the Eagles and DeMille donated monuments of the biblical Ten Commandments to communities all around the country. Rather than putting a product in the movie, the primary symbol of the movie was instead placed in prominent locations&#x2014;in public parks, in front of courthouses, and in the case of Texas on the grounds of the state capitol. These monuments reflected the zeitgeist, as the 1950s brought public, even government-sanctioned, expression of religion to the fore in many ways. This was also the decade in which &#x201c;In God We Trust&#x201d; was added to American currency, and the Pledge of Allegiance was amended to include the words &#x201c;under God.&#x201d;<br><br>Those monuments stood for decades without causing a fuss. In recent years, however, they have led to court battles over whether their location on publicly owned land violates the constitutional prohibition on a government establishment of religion. In other words, fifty years ago these displays were so noncontroversial that they could safely be used as a marketing ploy for a big-budget Hollywood movie. Now they are the subject of litigation all the way to the Supreme Court.1<br><br>Something has changed.<br><br>In 1960, presidential candidate John F. Kennedy had to reassure Protestants that they could safely vote for a Catholic. (At the time 30 percent of Americans freely told pollsters that they would not vote for a Catholic as president.) At the same time, Kennedy won overwhelming support from his fellow Catholics, even though he explicitly disagreed with his church on a number of public issues. In 2004, America had another Catholic presidential candidate&#x2014;also a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, also a highly decorated veteran, and also with the initials JFK. Like Kennedy, John (Forbes) Kerry also publicly disagreed with his church on at least one prominent issue&#x2014;in this case, abortion. But unlike Kennedy, Kerry split the Catholic vote with his Republican opponent, and lost handily among Catholics who frequently attend church. Kennedy would likely have found it inexplicable that Kerry not only lost to a Protestant, but in George W. Bush, an evangelical Protestant at that. Writing about the religious tensions manifested in the 1960 campaign, political scientist Philip Converse described the election as a &#x201c;flash of lightning which illuminated, but only momentarily, a darkened landscape.&#x201d;2 Kerry&#x2019;s candidacy was another flash of lightning, but the landscape it revealed had changed significantly. In 1960, religion&#x2019;s role in politics was mostly a matter of something akin to tribal loyalty&#x2014;Catholics and Protestants each supported their own. In order to win, Kennedy had to shatter the stained glass ceiling that had kept Catholics out of national elective office in a Protestant-majority nation. By the 2000s, how religious a person is had become more important as a political dividing line than which denomination he or she belonged to. Church-attending evangelicals and Catholics (and other religious groups too) have found common political cause. Voters who are not religious have also found common cause with one another, but on the opposite end of the political spectrum.<br><br>Again, something has changed.<br><br>This book is about what has changed in American religion over the past half century. Perhaps the most noticeable shift is how Americans have become polarized along religious lines. Americans are increasingly concentrated at opposite ends of the religious spectrum&#x2014;the highly religious at one pole, and the avowedly secular at the other. The moderate religious middle is shrinking. Contrast today&#x2019;s religious landscape with America in the decades following the Second World War, when moderate&#x2014;or mainline&#x2014;religion was booming. In the past, there were religious tensions, but they were largely between religions (Catholic vs. Protestant most notably), rather than between the religious and irreligious. Today, America remains, on average, a highly religious nation, but that average obscures a growing secular swath of the population.<br><br>The nation&#x2019;s religious polarization has not been an inexorable process of smoothly unfolding change. Rather, it has resulted from three seismic societal shocks, the first of which was the sexually libertine 1960s. This tumultuous period then produced a prudish aftershock of growth in conservative religion, especially evangelicalism, and an even more pronounced cultural presence for American evangelicals, most noticeably in the political arena. As theological and political conservatism began to converge, religiously inflected issues emerged on the national political agenda, and &#x201c;religion&#x201d; became increasingly associated with the Republican Party. The first aftershock was followed by an opposite reaction, a second aftershock, which is still reverberating. A growing number of Americans, especially young people, have come to disavow religion. For many, their aversion to religion is rooted in unease with the association between religion and conservative politics. If religion equals Republican, then they have decided that religion is not for them.<br><br>Religious polarization has consequences beyond the religious realm, because being at one pole or the other correlates strongly with one&#x2019;s worldview, especially attitudes relating to such intimate matters as sex and the family. Given that American politics often centers on sex and family issues, this religious polarization has been especially visible in partisan politics. A &#x201c;coalition of the religious&#x201d; tends to vote one way, while Americans who are not religious vote another.<br><br>The current state of religious polarization has led social commentators to use heated, even hyperbolic, language to describe the state of American society. The bestseller lists are full of books highly critical of religion, countered by pundits whose rhetoric decries a public square made &#x201c;naked&#x201d; by religion&#x2019;s absence.3 In an overused metaphor, America is supposedly in the midst of a war over our culture.4<br><br>And yet, when one ignores these venomous exchanges, and looks instead at how Americans of different religious backgrounds interact, the United States hardly seems like a house divided against itself. America peacefully combines a high degree of religious devotion with tremendous religious diversity&#x2014;including growing ranks of the nonreligious. Americans have a high degree of tolerance for those of (most) other religions, including those without any religion in their lives.<br><br>Religion&#x2019;s role in America thus poses a puzzle. <i>How can religious pluralism coexist with religious polarization?</i><br><br>The answer lies in the fact that, in America, religion is highly fluid. The conditions producing that fluidity are a signal feature of the nation&#x2019;s constitutional infrastructure. The very first words of the Bill of Rights guarantee that Congress&#x2014;later interpreted to mean any level of government&#x2014;will favor no particular religion, while ensuring that Americans can freely exercise their religious beliefs. In the legal arena, debates over such matters as whether the Ten Commandments can be displayed on public property hinge on the interpretation of the Constitution&#x2019;s words. More broadly, the absence of a state-run religious monopoly combined with a wide sphere of religious liberty has produced an ideal environment for a thriving religious ecosystem. Religions compete, adapt, and evolve as individual Americans freely move from one congregation to another, and even from one religion to another. In the United States, it seems perfectly natural to refer to one&#x2019;s religion as a &#x201c;preference&#x201d; instead of as a fixed characteristic.<br><br>This state of flux has actually contributed to religious polarization. A fluid religious environment enables people seeking something different to leave one religion for another, to find religion for the first time, or to leave religion altogether. This churn means that people gradually, but continually, sort themselves into like-minded clusters&#x2014;their commonality defined not only by religion, but also by the social and political beliefs that go along with their religion.<br><br>The malleable nature of American religion, however, means that these clusters are not bunkers. Instead, the same fluidity that contributes to religious polarization means that nearly all Americans are acquainted with people of a different religious background. Even if you personally have never gone through a religious change, you likely know someone who has. Furthermore, that someone is likely to be more than a passing acquaintance, but rather a co-worker, a close friend, a spouse, or a child. All of this religious churn produces a jumble of relationships among people of varying religious backgrounds, often within extended families and even households, which keeps religious polarization from pulling the nation apart.<br><br>The contrast between John F. Kennedy in 1960 and John Kerry in 2004 is thus doubly revealing. It not only highlights the new ways that religion divides American society but, more subtly, it also reminds us that old divisions are largely forgotten. In 1960, Kennedy faced overt hostility to his Catholicism, even in polite company. We find it no coincidence that this was also a time when there were many social barriers to relationships between Catholics and Protestants. John Kerry ran in a different world. By 2004 his Catholicism presented no problems for Protestants. We again find it hardly coincidental that in the years between Kennedy and Kerry, Americans of many different religious backgrounds increasingly came to connect with one another&#x2014;as neighbors, friends, and spouses. That electoral flash of lightning in 2004 thus illuminated more than the changed political topography; it also exposed an altered social landscape. Interreligious personal connections have resulted in a social web interwoven with different religions and people with no religion at all&#x2014;with implications far beyond presidential politics.<br><br>Over the last fifty years, American religion has thus experienced two countervailing transformations. The first is the emergence of a new religious fault line in American society. Left on its own, such a fault line could split open and tear the nation apart. The second change, however, is precisely why the fault line has not become a gaping chasm. Polarization has not been accompanied by religious segregation&#x2014;either literally or even metaphorically. To the contrary, rather than cocooning into isolated religious communities, Americans have become increasingly likely to work with, live alongside, and marry people of other religions&#x2014;or people with no religion at all. In doing so, they have come to accept people with a religious background different from theirs. It is difficult to demonize the religion, or lack of religion, of people you know and, especially, those you love. Indeed, interreligious relationships are so common that most Americans probably pay them little mind, and consider them unremarkable. But their very commonness makes them remarkable indeed.<br><br>Polarization and pluralism are the principal themes in the recent history of American religion, but they hardly exhaust all that has changed, is changing, and will change in the nation&#x2019;s religious environment. The sheer vitality of religion in America means that it is ever evolving, although that evolution takes place against a backdrop of some constants too. We begin by asking how and why American religion became polarized, and close by asking&#x2014;and answering&#x2014;how polarization and pluralism can coexist. But to get from polarization to peaceful pluralism, we consider a number of other questions along the way:<br><br><i>To what extent do Americans engage in religious mixing and matching?</i><br><br><i>Which religions win, and which lose, in the religious marketplace? Historically, who have been the winners, and who the losers?</i><br><br><i>What keeps people in their congregations, and why do they switch from one to another? How have religious entrepreneurs responded to the second aftershock, which is pushing people&#x2014;young people especially&#x2014;away from religion?</i><br><br><i>How has religion engaged three major trends in American society: the revolution in women&#x2019;s rights, rising income inequality, and growing ethnic and racial diversity?</i><br><br><i>What happened to cause religious devotion to be so strongly associated with partisan politics, and what will the future likely hold for the connections between religion and politics?</i><br><br><i>How does politics happen, or not, inside a congregation? How can religiosity be so closely associated with partisan politics when overt politicking from the pulpit is rare?</i><br><br><i>Who is right: those who make the case for the positive contribution of religion to civil society, or those who make the case against?</i><br><b><b>BACKDROP</b></b><br><br>Any discussion of religion in America must begin with the incontrovertible fact that Americans are a highly religious people. One can quibble over just how religion, and religiosity, should be gauged, but, by any standard, the United States (as a whole) is a religious nation. In general, Americans have high rates of religious <i>belonging, behaving</i>, and <i>believing</i>&#x2014;what social scientists call the three Bs of religiosity.5 Eighty-three percent of Americans report belonging to a religion; 40 percent report attending religious services nearly every week or more;6 59 percent pray at least weekly; a third report reading scripture with this same frequency. Many Americans also have firm religious beliefs. Eighty percent are absolutely sure that there is a God. Sixty percent are absolutely sure that there is a heaven, although fewer (52 percent) have this level of certainty about life after death. Slightly fewer, 49 percent, are certain that there is a hell.<br><br>Yet it is also important to note that not every American is so religious, or religious at all. After all, 15 percent <i>never</i> attend religious services, 17 percent do <i>not</i> identify with a religion, 20 percent are <i>not</i> certain about the existence of God, 40 percent are <i>not</i> sure there is a heaven, and 48 percent are <i>not</i> certain there is life after death.<br><br>When we put these basic facts together, a picture of religion in America comes into focus. Americans overwhelmingly, albeit not universally, identify with a religion. Identity, however, does not necessarily translate into religious activity because not all who identify with a religion frequently attend religious services, or engage in other religious behavior. The vast majority of Americans also believe in God, but Americans are less sure about life beyond the grave. Ever an optimistic people, Americans are more likely to envision heaven than hell. In fact, more Americans are certain about heaven than are certain about life after death. When we probe further, we find that Americans believe in a God who is loving and not very judgmental. Sixty-two percent say they &#x201c;very often&#x201d; feel God&#x2019;s <i>love</i> in their life, while only 39 percent say that they feel God&#x2019;s <i>judgment</i> this frequently. Americans&#x2019; God is more avuncular than angry, and it turns out (as we shall see in Chapter 13) that this sort of everyday theology has real implications for the ways in which Americans get along with one another.

Voil�&#x2014;a picture book that exemplifies simplicity at its most creative and entertaining. The four words of the title, combined in various ways, form a visual tale as a bear juggles, interacts with, and ultimately eats an orange, pear, and apple. Stark white backgrounds set off Gravett's loosely brushed watercolor pictures of animal and fruit, which play off of the staccato words to demonstrate how punctuation and intonation can dramatically alter meanings: Apple, Pear goes with an image of stacked fruit, while Orange Bear shows the animal puzzling over his citrus-hued fur. Though the book's design appears artless, it is quite the opposite, skillfully juxtaposing page layouts to maximize the humor of the wordplay. Ideal for prereaders and helpful to those ready to write stories of their own, this will make children laugh and learn as they follow the bear's antics and chant the rhymed sequences of words.

His <em>Dialogues</em> ask if a belief in God can be inferred from what is known of the universe, or whether such a belief is even consistent with such knowledge. <em>The Natural History of Religion</em> investigates the origins of belief, and follows its development from polytheism to dogmatic monotheism. Together, these works constitute the most formidable attack upon religious belief ever mounted by a philosopher.<br>This new edition includes Section XI of <em>The Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding</em> and a letter by Hume in which he discusses <em>Dialogues</em>.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p>He is also the author of Hume&#39;s Philosophy of Religion (1988) and Varieties of Unbelief (1989).</p><h2>The German Ideology</h2><p>Hitherto men have constantly made up for themselves false conceptions about themselves, about what they are and what they ought to be. They have arranged their relationships according to their ideas of God, of normal man, etc. The phantoms of their brains have got out of their hands. They, the creators, have bowed down before their creations. Let us liberate them from the chimeras, the ideas, dogmas, imaginary beings under the yoke of which they are pining away. Let us revolt against the rule of thoughts. Let us teach men, says one, to exchange these imaginations for thoughts which correspond to the essence of man; says the second, to take up a critical attitude to them; says the third, to knock them out of their heads; and -- existing reality will collapse. These innocent and childlike fancies are the kernel of the modern Young-Hegelian philosophy, which not only is received by the German public with horror and awe, but is announced by our philosophic heroes with the solemn consciousness of its cataclysmic dangerousness and criminal ruthlessness. The first volume of the present publication has the aim of uncloaking these sheep, who take themselves and are taken for wolves; of showing how their bleating merely imitates in a philosophic form the conceptions of the German middle class; how the boasting of these philosophic commentators only mirrors the wretchedness of the real conditions in Germany. It is its aim to debunk and discredit the philosophic struggle with the shadows of reality, which appeals to the dreamy and muddled German nation. Once upon a time a valiant fellow had the idea that men were drowned in water only because they were possessed with the idea of gravity. If they were to knock this notion out of their heads, say by stating it to be a superstition, a religious concept, they would be sublimely proof against any danger from water. His whole life long he fought against the illusion of gravity, of whose harmful results all statistic brought him new and manifold evidence. This valiant fellow was the type of the new revolutionary philosophers in Germany.</p><p>Described as one of the most influential figures in human history, Karl Marx was a German philosopher and economist who wrote extensively on the benefits of socialism and the flaws of free-market capitalism. His most notable works, Das Kapital and The Communist Manifesto (the latter of which was co-authored by his collaborator Friedrich Engels), have since become two of history s most important political and economic works. Marxismthe term that has come to define the philosophical school of thought encompassing Marx s ideas about society, politics and economicswas the foundation for the socialist movements of the twentieth century, including Leninism, Stalinism, Trotskyism, and Maoism. Despite the negative reputation associated with some of these movements and with Communism in general, Marx s view of a classless socialist society was a utopian one which did not include the possibility of dictatorship. Greatly influenced by the philosopher G. W. F. Hegel, Marx wrote in radical newspapers from his young adulthood, and can also be credited with founding the philosophy of dialectical materialism. Marx died in London in 1883 at the age of 64.</p><h2>Pin Loom Weaving to Go: 30 Projects for Portable Weaving</h2><p>Step-by-step instructions for 25 projects you&#x2019;ll be amazed were made from pin loom weavings!<br><br>Pin looms are hot!

In her latest book on pin-loom weaving, Stump shares her inspired designs for pieces woven on a variety of portable looms, including the standard 4" x 4" loom, a 2" x 2" pin loom, an adjustable fine-gauge knitting loom, and a potholder loom. <br>Almost a third of the book focuses on tutorials. In addition to instructions for weaving with each type of loom, the book shows how to make a 2" x 2" loom and how to join woven pieces. I especially enjoyed the tutorial for weaving with yarn on a potholder loom. Anyone who enjoys weaving on the ubiquitous 4" x 4" loom will love the tutorials on bias weaving and weaving triangles. The triangle tutorial is particularly clever and opens up a whole new world of design possibilities with this simple loom.

From exciting young talent and self-proclaimed hip hop nerd Ed Piskor, acclaimed for his hacker graphic novel Wizzywig, comes this explosively entertaining, encyclopedic history of the formative years of the music genre that changed global culture. Originally serialized on the hugely popular website Boing Boing, The Hip Hop Family Tree is now collected in a single volume cleverly presented and packaged in a style mimicking the Marvel comics of the same era. Piskor�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s exuberant yet controlled cartooning takes you from the parks and rec rooms of the South Bronx to the night clubs, recording studios, and radio stations where the scene started to boom, capturing the flavor of late-1970s New York City in panels bursting with obsessively authentic detail. With a painstaking, vigorous and engaging Ken Burns meets- Stan Lee approach, the battles and rivalries, the technical innovations, the triumphs and failures are all thoroughly researched and lovingly depicted. plus the charismatic players behind the scenes like Russell Simmons, Sylvia Robinson and then-punker Rick Rubin. Piskor also traces graffiti master Fab 5 Freddy�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s rise in the art world, and Debbie Harry, Keith Haring, The Clash, and other luminaries make cameos as the music and culture begin to penetrate downtown Manhattan and the mainstream at large. Like the acclaimed hip hop documentaries Style Wars and Scratch, The Hip Hop Family Tree is an exciting and essential cultural chronicle and a must for hip hop fans, pop-culture addicts, and anyone who wants to know how it went down back in the day.</p><p>Ed Piskor (1982) lives and draws out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

It&#x2019;s interesting to listen to him seemingly abandon the song for the day to work on "Golden Slumbers" and "Carry That Weight" and then return to it. The sad beauty of the basic melody is touching &#x2013; and it illustrates why Paul was so perturbed when Phil Spector made the song into a big production in 1970.</p><h2>What Is Tao?</h2><p>In his later years, Alan Watts, noted author and respected authority on Zen and Eastern thought, turned his attention to Taoism.

Slow in speech, shy in manner, thoughtful in mind, weak in health, he went back north for a quiet life. Influenced by the group of poets there, he may have written some of the doubtful poems included in our Virgilian manuscripts. All his undoubted extant work is written in his perfect hexameters. Earliest comes the collection of ten pleasingly artificial bucolic poems, the <i>Eclogues</i>, which imitated freely Theocritus's idylls. They deal with pastoral life and love. Before 29 BCE came one of the best of all didactic works, the four books of Georgics on tillage, trees, cattle, and bees. Virgil's remaining years were spent in composing his great, not wholly finished, epic the <i>Aeneid</i>, on the traditional theme of Rome's origins through Aeneas of Troy. Inspired by the Emperor Augustus's rule, the poem is Homeric in metre and method but influenced also by later Greek and Roman literature, philosophy, and learning, and deeply Roman in spirit. Virgil died in 19 BCE at Brundisium on his way home from Greece, where he had intended to round off the <i>Aeneid</i>. He had left in Rome a request that all its twelve books should be destroyed if he were to die then, but they were published by the executors of his will.</p><p>The Loeb Classical Library edition of Virgil is in two volumes.</p></p><p><p>Henry Rushton Fairclough (1862&#x2013;1938) was Professor of Classical Literature at Stanford University.</p><p>G.

But unlike most firms on the Street, proprietary firms have no clients. They do not take other people's money and speculate it on their behalf. Proprietary trading (or 'prop trading' for short) is done for the benefit of the company's partners and employees only: the firm is the client. Their profits are generated solely from the bets they make on their traders. If they are wrong, they lose their own money. When they are right, they keep a percentage of their winnings. The world of prop trading is mentally and emotionally exhausting, but the rewards can be substantial, if you understand how to identify good trades, take profits at the right time, and limit losses. <p>In <i>One Good Trade</i>, Mike Bellafiore reveals the inner workings of the proprietary trading firm he cofounded, detailing the challenges of prop trading and explaining why traders succeed or fail. In the process, he shows how you can use the skills and strategies developed at his firm to improve your own trading success.</p> <p>The author takes you inside the world of prop trading to show how the professionals trade successfully, sharing all the important market lessons he has learned over the course of his career while introducing a fascinating cast of characters, some of whom have succeeded, and too many who have failed. He offers a range of straightforward trading strategies, such as breakouts from congestion, trading off support and resistance, and identifying consolidation setups. Perhaps more importantly, he explains the importance of other, often overlooked skills critical to successful trading: developing consistency in monitoring markets and uncovering trading opportunities, discipline in executing trades, making rational risk/reward bets, and managing trading capital. He reveals those skills through illustrative stories of the growth of his trading firm and the ups and downs of traders he has trained.</p> <p>Becoming a better trader requires discipline, a thick playbook of trading setups , and well-rounded trading skills, and <i>One Good Trade</i> will show you how to develop all three.</p></p><h2>Principles of Public Speaking</h2><p><p></p> <p></p> <p>Balancing skills and theory, <i>Principles of Public Speaking, 19th Edition, </i>emphasizes orality, internet technology, and critical thinking as it encourages the reader to see public speaking as a way to build community in today&#x2019;s diverse world.

Why must we fight in a wretched downpour? I hook my left leg around Brocc&#x2019;s right and throw my full weight backward, toppling us both to the ground. We roll, coating ourselves with mud. Shit! Who would want to do this for the rest of their life? I must be crazy.</p><p>The wind gusts in, straight off the northern sea, driving the rain sideways. Brocc curses. There&#x2019;s a little catch in his breath. I&#x2019;ve almost got him.</p><p>&#x201c;Go for his nuts!&#x201d; someone shouts.</p><p>&#x201c;Grab her hair!&#x201d; yells someone else. Dau, I&#x2019;m guessing. He likes to see me lose.</p><p>There&#x2019;s no need to look at Archu, even if I could turn my head. I know what he&#x2019;s thinking: This isn&#x2019;t some brawl behind the drinking hall, it&#x2019;s training for the real thing. You&#x2019;ve got advantages. Use them.</p><p>Superior height, I tell myself as Brocc fights his way up onto one knee and, for a moment, loosens his hold on my right arm. Stronger will to win. Sheer bloody-mindedness. I claw up a handful of mud and throw it in his face. He swears, releases his hold, puts his hands up to his eyes. I twist onto my knees and deliver a well-calculated punch to his jaw. And he&#x2019;s down.</p><p>&#x201c;Cease.&#x201d; Archu lifts his hand. &#x201c;Bout goes to Liobhan.&#x201d;</p><p>It&#x2019;s over, thank the gods of wind and weather. There&#x2019;s a scattering of applause from our drenched comrades, who are required to observe all bouts, no matter what the weather. Archu believes there&#x2019;s always something to learn, especially from watching people make mistakes. I hold out a hand to Brocc and haul him to his feet.</p><p>&#x201c;Should&#x2019;ve seen that coming,&#x201d; he mumbles, swiping at his face with his mud-soaked sleeve.</p><p>What can I say? We&#x2019;ve been sparring together since we were children. He knows I&#x2019;ll use dirty tricks to win if that&#x2019;s what it takes. More often than not I do win against Brocc; he&#x2019;s too honorable for his own good.</p><p>&#x201c;Untidy bout,&#x201d; says Archu. &#x201c;Brocc, you had the advantage there briefly, but you let it go. Don&#x2019;t let your thoughts drift off, especially in these conditions. Sharpen your eyes, sharpen your ears, feel what&#x2019;s going on in every part of your body. Even as you counter her move, you should be anticipating her next. If she catches you unprepared, you&#x2019;re gone. Make an error like that in a real situation and you might be dead. Which would be less than useful to whoever&#x2019;s paying for your services. Here.&#x201d; He fishes a disreputable cloth from some hidden corner of his voluminous fur cloak&#x2014;the garment is almost legendary&#x2014;and passes it over. &#x201c;Wipe that stuff off your face.&#x201d; He turns toward me. &#x201c;Liobhan, quick thinking there. I hope you haven&#x2019;t done your brother any damage. There are cleaner ways you could have ended that. Tell me some.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been running over the fight in my mind, since Archu always asks this. &#x201c;If I&#x2019;d been quicker after we both went down, I could have thrown my full weight across him. Or earlier on, when I did the lock-and-throw move, if I&#x2019;d placed my feet wider I could have blocked him from doing that spring back up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The spring was well executed.&#x201d; Archu&#x2019;s hard gaze goes to Brocc, and he gives a brief nod of approval. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re nimble, no doubt of that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s cut out to be a strolling player.&#x201d; Dau again, supercilious bastard. &#x201c;A man of many talents: singing, harping, tumbling, and tricks.&#x201d;</p><p>I clench my teeth over the withering retort this comment deserves. Self-restraint is part of the Swan Island code, and Archu is present&#x2014;Archu, who will in time help decide which of us trainees become permanent members of the warrior band and which are dispatched home with the weight of failure on their shoulders. As for Brocc, he says not a word.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d be surprised,&#x201d; Archu observes, &#x201c;what talents a Swan Island warrior can use to strategic advantage. Some of them, you might not think of as combat skills. Should any of you be fortunate enough to stay the course and find a long-term place on the island, you&#x2019;ll find that the services we offer are diverse. It&#x2019;s not all heading out festooned with shiny weapons and killing the other fellow before he kills you. Though you need to learn that as well. Anyone else have any observations?&#x201d;</p><p>They do, of course. Our group has been on the island for two turnings of the moon, and the training&#x2019;s been intense. We work every day and often nights as well. We need to be capable under all conditions. Archu is chief combat trainer on Swan Island, but others also teach us. There are experts in swordsmanship, archery, fighting with staves and with bare hands, as you&#x2019;d expect at a school of war-craft. We learn the best way to scale rock faces, and what to do if someone gets stuck or falls, and how to fight off attackers when you&#x2019;re halfway up a cliff and hanging on for dear life. We&#x2019;re taught the care and maintenance of our equipment, from weapons to boots. Checks occur at irregular intervals, and if one of us is found with an ill-cleaned knife or muddy footwear, we all pay the price. A mouse-like woman named Eabha teaches us how to open locked doors and to hide effectively right under folk&#x2019;s noses. That is harder for a tall, sturdily built person than a slight one, as I have cause to know. The color of my hair&#x2014;a vivid red&#x2014;doesn&#x2019;t help.</p><p>One skill we can&#x2019;t learn on the island is mounted combat. Horses can&#x2019;t be kept here&#x2014;there&#x2019;s not much level ground, and all of it&#x2019;s taken up by the training facilities and living quarters. The remainder of the island&#x2014;steep rises, sudden dips, sheer cliffs&#x2014;is given over to sheep, seals, and puffins. Swan Island has a fleet of small boats, some for fishing, some to transfer people and supplies between island and mainland, and some, as we&#x2019;ve discovered, kept so we can practice fighting on a shifting deck without falling overboard. Our trainer for that is Haki, a giant Norseman.</p><p>We never forget that we&#x2019;re on trial here. Exercises to test us can happen at any time of the day or night. And all the time, our tutors are watching us. Who is the best, the strongest, the most promising? No point in asking who wants it most. All of us do, or we wouldn&#x2019;t be putting ourselves through this. Brocc and I prepared for months to win places in the training course, from which maybe two or three out of the twenty will be chosen to stay as permanent members of the Swan Island force. Nobody wants to be sent home.</p><p>If I was doing the choosing, I&#x2019;d pick Dau. He may be the least likable of the trainees, but he excels in all the physical tasks, and he&#x2019;s clever at solving puzzles and devising strategies. Brocc isn&#x2019;t the strongest fighter in the group, but he has other skills that might prove to be assets to Swan Island. It seems to me our trainers recognize his unusual talents, though none of them says anything. My brother has a remarkable ability for keeping other people calm under testing conditions. And he has a way of using his senses that goes beyond the ordinary, not just when he&#x2019;s playing music, but all the time. As for me, I know I&#x2019;m good enough. But although there are quite a few women working and living in the Swan Island community, and several female tutors, the elite fighting group has only two female members. That&#x2019;s two out of a force of more than fifty. And in this group of trainees I&#x2019;m the only woman. The odds are not in my favor. But I will prove myself. I didn&#x2019;t come here to fail.</p><p>&#x201c;If you want my opinion,&#x201d; Dau says now, &#x201c;Brocc goes easy on Liobhan because she&#x2019;s a female. He&#x2019;s hardly going to pinch her breast or dig an elbow in her privates. And he&#x2019;d never stand by while someone else attacked his sister. The expression on his face right now proves it.&#x201d;</p><p>I manage not to look at Brocc, though I know how he must be feeling. Wretched Dau! Along with his other talents comes an unerring ability to find and exploit a person&#x2019;s weak spot. I can see how that might come in useful, but I&#x2019;d prefer him not to exercise it on the rest of us.</p><p>No comment from Archu. He&#x2019;s biding his time. Letting us hang ourselves with our own rope.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s bollocks, Dau.&#x201d; This is our Norse trainee, Hrothgar, a big, bearded man. I get on well with Hrothgar. He&#x2019;s told me how it was where he grew up, how the women can be leaders and fighters and heads of the household if there is a need, and how they are respected for whatever they do. His sister wanted to come with him to Swan Island, but she&#x2019;s only thirteen; five years younger than me. &#x201c;Brocc&#x2019;s a fine fighter,&#x201d; Hrothgar goes on. &#x201c;How do you think Liobhan got so good? By practicing with him for years, that&#x2019;s how. He&#x2019;s got his own style, that&#x2019;s all. As for standing by while someone attacked one of your comrades, male or female, would you do that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There might be a time when I had to,&#x201d; Dau says. &#x201c;What if we were on a mission under cover, and defending my comrade would mean destroying that cover? Haven&#x2019;t we been told that fulfilling the mission must always come first?&#x201d; He glances at Archu, but if our trainer replies, his words are drowned by a sudden, violent increase in the rain. It roars across the island, blotting out everything in sight and making an abrupt end to conversation. Archu points in the general direction of the nearest building, and we sprint for shelter.</p><p>The rain is still bucketing down outside hours later, as we sit in the hall after supper. This is the time when the whole community comes together to enjoy food and drink and good fellowship. Tales are told before the hearth fire, jugs of mead or ale are passed around, and those of us who can play or sing provide musical entertainment. Brocc and I both love music. At home, our band was in demand for village weddings and festivals. We even played for some grand gatherings in the household of Dalriada&#x2019;s crown prince, which is not far from our family home. The Swan Island community soon learned we were musicians&#x2014;the arrival of Brocc with his harp strapped to his back made it pretty plain.</p><p>Archu is a musician, too. The man&#x2019;s arms are all muscle; he handles the bodhran as he handles the sword, as if it&#x2019;s an extension of himself. You can hear the warrior&#x2019;s marching feet and beating heart in his playing, and the sounds of the island&#x2019;s natural world: the great wings of the albatross, the dive and twist of a seal, the thrum of wind in thatch. He&#x2019;s as much a master of drumming as he is of just about every form of combat. Archu doesn&#x2019;t talk about his life before the island, or where and how he developed those skills. And we don&#x2019;t ask. But I&#x2019;d like to hear his story one day.</p><p>On the evening after that bout in the mud, Haki tells a story of his time as an ulfhednar, a Wolfskin. The role of these peerless warriors is to leap from the prow of the longship as it comes in to shore, setting terror into the hearts of their enemies. They&#x2019;re god-sworn and, from the sound of it, more than half crazy. This particular tale concerns an ax that was blessed by the gods, which for a long time brought good fortune to the man who wielded it. But when it fell into the hands of another, everything changed. We&#x2019;re all captivated by this story, and I can see from my brother&#x2019;s intense concentration that he&#x2019;s already making it into a song.</p><p>&#x201c;And on the night Brynjolf breathed his last breath&#x201d;&#x2014;Haki&#x2019;s voice has dropped to a near whisper&#x2014;&#x201c;the men who sat vigil over him swore that although the ax rested beside him on his bier, they could hear its voice in the air above him, singing the true song of a fine blade: Home, my faithful one, come home now to the hall of the gods! And to the one who stole me from you, I say: A curse upon you for your betrayal of a friend! May your sword be blunt and your arm be weak, and may your enemies laugh in your face until the day you die!&#x201d;</p><p>It&#x2019;s a fine story. Who cares if it&#x2019;s true or not? Next it&#x2019;s our turn to entertain: a makeshift band made up of me, Brocc, Archu, and Eimear, a girl who&#x2019;s good on the whistle. I&#x2019;m capable on the whistle, too&#x2014;in a band, the more things you can turn your hand to the better. Eimear and I are performing a reel as question and answer, taking eight measures in turn and gradually speeding up. By the end, the would-be dancers are falling over their own feet and breathless with laughter. It all feels oddly right. Swan Island&#x2019;s warriors are the best of the best in combat, and their deeds are spoken of in hushed tones all over Erin, forming the stuff of fireside tales. Yet at times like this, they&#x2019;re a big, warm family.</p></p><h2>No Greater Ally: The Untold Story of Poland&#x2019;s Forces in World War II (General Military)</h2><p><p>There is a chapter of World War 2 history that remains largely untold: the story of the fourth largest Allied military of the war, and the only nation to have fought in the battles of Leningrad, Arnhem, Tobruk and Normandy. This is the story of the Polish forces during the Second World War, the story of millions of young men and women who gave everything for freedom and in the final victory lost all. In a cruel twist of history, the monumental struggles of an entire nation have been largely forgotten, and even intentionally obscured. </p><p>Available for the first time in paperback, No Greater Ally redresses the balance, giving a comprehensive overview of Poland's participation in World War 2. Following their valiant but doomed defense of Poland in 1939, members of the Polish armed forces fought with the Allies wherever and however they could. With previously unpublished first-hand accounts, information never before seen in English, and rare photographs, this title provides a detailed analysis of the devastation the war brought to Poland, and the final betrayal when, having fought for freedom for six long years, Poland was handed to the Soviet Union.</p></p><p>Ken Koskodan graduated from Michigan State University with a degree in Communications. The emphasis of his degree was in Journalism, Advertising and Public Relations. Of Polish descent himself, he has researched Poland&#39;s participation in World War II for many years, and in the course of his research has interviewed many surviving veterans. This is his first book. The author lives in Detroit, MI.<p>&#x201c;This fascinating book fills a yawning gap in our knowledge of the Second World War. By bringing in the personal reminiscences of people of all stations, the author gives pace and immediacy to this extraordinary story.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Adam Zamoyski, author of Forgotten Few: The Polish Air Force in World War II</i></p><p>&#x201c;No Greater Ally is an absolutely crucial contribution to the history of the Second World War. Anybody who seeks to understand the dynamics of betrayal and resistance as they apply to this period, in Poland, in Europe, must read this book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Alan Furst, author of The Polish Soldier</i></p><p>&#x201c;I hadn't realised, before reading this outstanding book, just how crucial the Polish contribution to [Allied] victory actually was. If it hadn't been for their pilots, for instance, we might well have lost the Battle of Britain...&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Henry Coningsby, Waterstones</i></p></p><h2>Food at the Time of the Bible. From Adam&#39;s Apple to the Last Supper</h2><p>What did people eat at the time of the Bible? How did they grow their food, store it, trade in it and prepare it? What are the symbolic meanings behind various foods? This is an in-depth, easy-to-read survey of every aspect of food in the Bible, accompanied by beautiful illustrations and photographs. The book examines each type of food, starting with the seven species that grow in the Holy Land, and continues with fish, meat and milk, fruit, vegetables and sweets. The impact of food on history is explained, how pacts were sealed by a meal and how the very act of eating was imbued with sanctity. At the end of the book is a section on recipes which could have been prepared in ancient times.</p><p></p><h2>Lonely Planet Romania &amp; Bulgaria 7 (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world's leading travel guide publisher</i></p><p><b>Lonely Planet Romania &amp; Bulgaria </b>is your passport to all the most relevant and up-to-date advice on what to see, what to skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

The second of the four Fairchild Family series books to be brought back to young readers by Bethlehem Books.</p><p>Rebecca Caudill is the pen name of Mrs. James S. Ayers. Born in 1899, she writes about herself: &#x201c;One of eleven children, I was born on a rocky farm squeezed between the Black Mountains and the Poor Fork River in Harlan County, Kentucky&#x201d; (More About Junior Authors). A few years later the family moved to Tennessee. While she attended highschool, young Miss Caudill &#x201c;heard of college and decided to go to one. Having nary a penny to go on didn&#x2019;t strike me as an obstacle at all.&#x201d; She learned stenography, aided by an older sister, and with this skill, Miss Caudill was able to work her way through Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia, &#x201c;the first Wesleyan student ever to work for her education.&#x201d; After receiving a master&#x2019;s degree from Vanderbilt University, she proceeded to &#x201c;see the world,&#x201d; doing teaching, office work and editing in such varied places as Rio de Janeiro, Toronto, and Nashville, Tennessee; and traveling throughout Europe. In Turkey, on the verge of signing a magazine-editing contract, she met another editor, James S. Ayers. They married and were to have two children. They lived in Urbana, Illinois, for many years. Throughout their long married life, Rebecca, now Mrs. Ayers, and her husband encouraged one another in their respective writing talents. &#x201c;My writing for children,&#x201d; she comments, &#x201c;&#x2014;even the re-writing&#x2014;has been an exercise in joy. Most of my books are based on experiences of my own childhood spent in Appalachian Kentucky, and so are written from the heart,&#x201d; (Twentieth Century Children&#x2019;s Authors). Mrs. Ayers&#x2019; books for older children involve pioneer families in well-researched 18th and 19th century settings, often with a touch of mountain dialect. The Far-off Land, for instance, takes 16-year-old Ketty, with her brother, on a flatboat down the Holston and Tennessee Rivers. This book was inspired by an actual journal of 1779-1780, written by a colonel making such a flatboat voyage. Her books for younger children enlarge upon every-day pleasures and difficulties with a sense of wonder and freshness. Happy Little Family and the three further novels that trace the same family&#x2019;s life in succeeding years are fine representatives of the author&#x2019;s appeal to young readers. She has also written with charm for the youngest children in books like A Pocket Full of Cricket and A Certain Small Shepherd&#x2014;this last being a Christmas story, illustrated by William Pene du Bois. Mrs. Ayers died in 1985.</p><h2>Interview With an Exorcist: An Insider&#39;s Look at the Devil, Demonic Possession, and the Path to Deliverance</h2><p><p>In today's culture of scientific enlightenment, many consider belief in demonic possession and exorcism to be superstitious remnants of the Dark Ages. Even many Christians, contrary to the clear words of Jesus in the Gospels, scoff at the notion that the devil and demons really exist. Is demonic possession real? Are believers really in any danger from Satan and his crafty minions? What is the truth about exorcism?</p> <p>In this captivating book, you will find answers to these questions and many more. Written by one of the Church's foremost experts on the topic, Interview with an Exorcist is based on Fr. Jose Antonio Fortea's years of working as an exorcist, his extensive investigations of cases of suspected possessions, and his attendance at hundreds of exorcisms.</p> <p><b>You will learn:</b></p> <ul> <li>The difference between demonic possession, obsession, and infestation</li> <li>What really happens at an exorcism</li> <li>The signs that show when possession is present</li> <li>How to tell the difference between psychological problems and demonic influence</li> <li>Why the number of possessions has been increasing in recent times</li> <li>Why consulting mediums, dabbling in witchcraft, or having recourse to other occult practices is an open invitation to demonic spirits</li> <li>Why the permission of the local bishop is required for an exorcism to occur</li> <li>Why some within the Church disparage this essential apostolic ministry</li> </ul></p><p>Fr. Jos� Antonio Fortea is a priest of the Diocese of Alcal� de Henares (Madrid), Spain, and an expert in the field of demonology.</p><h2>The Secret of the Runes</h2><p>The runes are said to have &#x201c;revealed themselves&#x201d; to von List, uncovering a complete cosmology and esoteric understanding of the primeval Teutonic/Aryan peoples, and becoming the cornerstone of his ideology. No other work so clearly and simply sets forth the full spectrum of von List&#x2019;s fantastic vision of a mystical philosophy based on Germanic principles.</p><p>Renowned as an expert in Indo-European Germanic linguistics and mythology, Guido von List was the undisputed "high priest" of the Germanic occult renaissance of the early twentieth century. Stephen Flowers studied Germanic and Celtic philology and religious history at the University of Texas at Austin and in Goettingen, West Germany. He received his Ph.D. in 1984 in Germanic Languages and Medieval Studies with a dissertation entitled <i>Runes and Magic</i>.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Breaking The Hex: Life With God After The Cross Killed Religion</h2><p>BREAKING THE HEX: life with God after the cross killed religionThis book will free your mind, heart and spirit. What if we Christians are living under a hex and do not even realize it?What if the crucifixion of Jesus Christ changed life far more than we realize?What if we have completely misunderstood what it is to &#x201c;live the Christian life?&#x201d;What if doing life with God is far simpler than we have imagined?Breaking the Hex, by brothers Roger Fields and Jeff Fields, is not a &#x201c;how-to&#x201d; book. It is a &#x201c;what-happened&#x201d; book. It is written in a style that is easy-to-read and often humorous. Using short, rapid-fire chapters, the Fields brothers describe life with God on THIS SIDE OF THE CROSS without the pressure of religious obligation. With the book of Galatians as the backdrop, Roger and Jeff describe how easy it is to be misled in our desire to walk with God. You will come away with a fresh appreciation and joy about the freedom that comes through the cross of Christ. You will have a renewed sense of your Heavenly Father&#x2019;s affection for you.

The 60-page guidebook, by Stuart R. Kaplan, features color illustrations of the tarocchi cards. The pack includes two bonus cards with portraits of Bianca Maria Visconti and Francesco Sforza. The 78-card deck is comprised of full-color facsimile reproductions of 74 extant, original Visconti-Sforza tarocchi cards that have survived from the 15th century (Milan, Italy). Four cards have been meticulously recreated to replace those missing from the original deck; The Devil, The Tower, Three of Swords, and Knight of Coins. The cards, which do not have titles or numbering, depict daily life in medieval Milan through allegorical imagery. The original cards are located in three different locations. Thirty-five of the original cards are located in the archives of the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York. Twenty-six extant cards are at the Accademia Carrara in Italy, and thirteen cards are housed at Casa Colleoni, in Bergamo, Italy.</p><p></p><h2>On the Theory of Prose (Russian Literature)</h2><p>As time has proven, <i>Theory of Prose</i> still remains one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most significant works of literary theory. It not only anticipates structuralism and poststructuralism, but poses questions about the nature of fiction that are as provocative today as they were in the 1920s. Founded on the concept of &#x201c;making strange,&#x201d; it lays bare the inner workings of fiction&#x2015;especially the works of Cervantes, Tolstoy, Sterne, Dickens, Bely and Rozanov&#x2015;and imparts a new way of seeing, of reading, and of interacting with the world.</p><p>Viktor Shklovsky (1893-1984) was a leading figure in the Russian Formalist movement of the 1920s and had a profound effect on twentieth-century Russian literature. Several of his books have been translated into English and are available from Dalkey Archive Press, including Zoo, or Letters Not about Love, Third Factory, A Sentimental Journey, Energy of Delusion, Literature and Cinematography, and Bowstring.<br><br>Shushan Avagyan translates from Armenian and Russian. She is the translator of Viktor Shklovsky's Bowstring: On the Dissimilarity of the Similar and other works by Shklovsky from Dalkey Archive Press.<br><br>Lyn Hejinian (born May 17, 1941) is an American poet, essayist, translator and publisher. She is often associated with the Language poets and is well known for her landmark work My Life (Sun &amp; Moon, 1987, original version Burning Deck, 1980), as well as her book of essays, The Language of Inquiry (University of California Press, 2000).Preface: It is perfectly clear that language is influenced by socioeconomic conditions. There is an essay by Gleb Uspensky in which he shows how a fishing crew creates its own reality by inventing names for a constellation of stars which guides them in their nightly &#34;search for the white salmon.&#34; In the language of cattle breeders you will find numerous words designating such peculiarities as the coat colors of cows and bulls. These do not lend themselves easily to translation. Nevertheless, the word is not a shadow. The word is a thing. It changes in accordance with the linguistic laws that govern the physiology of speech and so on. If in some language the name of a breastplate becomes the name of the breast of a human being, then, of course, this can be understood historically. But the changes of words do not necessarily correspond to the changes in the form of the breastplate, and, besides, the word may survive the phenomenon that had given rise to it in the first place. As a literary critic, I&#39;ve been engaged in the study of the internal laws that govern literature. If I may bring up the analogy of a factory, then I would say that neither the current state of the world cotton market nor the politics of cotton trusts interests me. One thing alone concerns me: the number of strands that make up the cotton plant and the different ways of weaving them. For that reason, this book is devoted in its entirety to a study of the changes in literary form.--Victor Shklovsky</p><h2>A Stillness at Appomattox (Army of the Potomac, Vol. 3)</h2><p>Recounting the final year of the Civil War, this classic volume by Bruce Catton won both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award for excellence in non-fiction.<br><br>In this final volume of the Army of the Potomac Trilogy, Catton, America's foremost Civil War historian, takes the reader through the battles of the Wilderness, the Bloody Angle, Cold Harbot, the Crater, and on through the horrible months to one moment at Appomattox. Grant, Meade, Sheridan, and Lee vividly come to life in all their failings and triumphs.</p><p>If every historian wrote like Bruce Catton, no one would read fiction. This marvelously well-told account of the final year of the Civil War marches readers from Wilderness, through Petersburg, and finally to the climax at Appomattox. The surrender scene, when Grant and Lee meet at last, is spine tingling. This is the third book of Catton's Army of the Potomac trilogy. It's also the best of the bunch, even though the first two, <i>Mr. Lincoln's Army</i> and <i>Glory Road</i>, are both exceptional. Not to be missed. <i>--John Miller</i>When first published in 1953, Bruce Catton, our foremost Civil War historian was awarded both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award for excellence in nonfiction. This final volume of <i>The Army Of The Potomac</i> trilogy relates the final year of the Civil War.</p><h2>The Last Centurion</h2><p>In the second decade of the twenty-first century the world is struck by two catastrophes, a new mini-ice age and, nearly simultaneously, a plague to dwarf all previous experiences. Rising out of the disaster is the character known to history as &#x201c;Bandit Six&#x201d; an American Army officer caught up in the struggle to rebuild the world and prevent the fall of his homeland&#x2014;despite the best efforts of politicians both elected and military. <i>The Last Centurion</i> is a memoir of one possible future, a world that is a darkling mirror of our own. Written &#x201c;blog-style,&#x201d; it pulls no punches in its descriptions of junk science, bad strategy and organic farming not to mention all three at once.</p><p>A veteran of the 82nd Airborne, he brings first-hand knowledge of military operations to his fiction. His novels for Baen include those in the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling Posleen War series (<i>A Hymn Before Battle</i>, <i>Gust Front</i>, <i>When the Devil Dances</i>, and <i>Hell&#x2019;s Faire</i>), the Council War series (<i>There Will be Dragons</i>, <i>Emerald Sea</i>, <i>Against the Tide</i>, and <i>East of the Sun, West of the Moon</i>), the nationally best-selling techno-thriller novels about Mike Harmon (<i>Ghost</i>, <i>Kildar</i>, <i>Choosers of the Slain</i>, <i>Unto the Breach</i>, and <i>A Deeper Blue</i>), the Looking-Glass series (<i>Into the Looking Glass</i>, <i>Vorpal Blade</i>, and <i>Manxome Foe</i>, the last two in collaboration with Travis S. Taylor), &nbsp;four collaborations with fellow <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author David Weber (<i>March Upcountry</i>,<i> March to the Sea</i>, <i>March to the Stars</i> and <i>We Few</i>) and five collaborative spinoffs from the Posleen series: <i>The </i><i>Hero</i>, written with Michael Z. Williamson, <i>Watch on the Rhine</i> and <i>Yellow Eyes</i>, both written with Tom Kratman, and the <i>New York Times</i> best seller <i>Cally&#x2019;s War</i> and its recent sequels <i>Sister Time</i> and <i>Honor of the Clan</i>, both with Julie Cochrane.Bandit Six and his band of soldiers are trapped in Iran in 2019 when the world is plagued by a series of disasters. First, a pandemic flu kills up to 60% of the population and then a mini ice age brings snows to Saudi Arabia. Left behind to secure a military base, Bandit Six and his men fight their way back from Iran to Turkey and then to the U.S. Dan John Miller&#39;s delivery is perfect for this no-punches-pulled first-person narrative by Bandit Six, the Last Centurion. Laced with crude language and dark images of the future, Miller&#39;s reading is straightforward and army tough. With few characterizations and little emotion, the listener is swept into the action. Miller becomes Bandit Six, patriotic, no-nonsense, and extra rough around the edges. M.B.K.

The myths, as H. A.

Why can Democrats sweep statewide offices in places like Pennsylvania and Michigan yet fail to take control of the same states' legislatures? Many place exclusive blame on partisan gerrymandering and voter suppression. But as political scientist Jonathan A. Rodden demonstrates in <i>Why Cities Lose</i>, the left's electoral challenges have deeper roots in economic and political geography.<br> In the late nineteenth century, support for the left began to cluster in cities among the industrial working class. Today, left-wing parties have become coalitions of diverse urban interest groups, from racial minorities to the creative class. These parties win big in urban districts but struggle to capture the suburban and rural seats necessary for legislative majorities. A bold new interpretation of today's urban-rural political conflict, <i>Why Cities Lose</i> also points to electoral reforms that could address the left's under-representation while reducing urban-rural polarization.</p><p><b>Jonathan A. Rodden</b> is professor of political science and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and founder and director of the Stanford Spatial Social Science Lab. The author of the prizewinning <i>Hamilton's Paradox</i>, he lives in Stanford, California."<i>Why Cities Lose</i> is a towering achievement in understanding the structural roots of partisan polarization in America and the critical role played by economic and political geography. Jonathan A. Rodden employs sophisticated historical, comparative, and data visualization techniques to shed light on the fateful consequences for political representation and policy of single-member, first-past-the-post legislative districts. It is certain to enrich scholarly and public debates."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Thomas E. Mann, coauthor of <i>It's Even Worse Than It Looks</i></b></i></b><br><br>"The biggest problem facing America today is political polarization: Democrats command the superstar cities and tech hubs that drive the knowledge economy, while Republicans have a stronghold in suburban places and rural areas. In this important book, Jonathan A. Rodden draws on a trove of data spanning the twentieth century to show us in painstaking detail why cities continue to lose out to rural and suburban interests and what challenges this poses for our democracy."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Richard Florida, author of <i>The Rise of the Creative Class</i> and <i>The New Urban Crisis</i></b></i></b><br><br>"<i>Why Cities Lose</i> is a masterful explanation for the main axis of conflict in contemporary US politics, the rural vs. urban divide. With exemplary scholarship and an eye to global trends as well as surprisingly important details such as the placement of railroads, Rodden gives us a thorough understanding of the central political conflicts of our time."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Katherine J. Cramer, author of <i>The Politics of Resentment</i></b></i></b><br><br>"This important book, which should reset our understanding of polarization in America and around the world, will comfort neither those on the left who see themselves as the vanguard of a victorious electoral future, nor those on the right who believe that voters are fundamentally conservative."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Andrew Gelman, author of <i>Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State</i></b></i></b><br><br>"This astute and illuminating book will change how you think about electoral fairness and political representation in America. <i>Why Cities Lose </i>meticulously demonstrates how winner-take-all congressional districts systematically under-represent urban voters in legislatures and destructively polarize politics along urban-rural lines -- not just in the United States, but also in Canada and the United Kingdom. The result is distorted representation in all winner-take-all democracies, even those with independent redistricting processes. At time when politics in America feels so unfair, this book clarifies how much our skewed electoral system is to blame. For anyone who wants to fix America's broken politics, this is absolutely essential reading."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Lee Drutman, author of <i>The Business of America is Lobbying</i></b></i></b></p><h2>The Cartoon Introduction to Calculus</h2><p><p><b>The internationally bestselling authors of <i>The Cartoon Introduction to Economics</i> return to make calculus fun</b></p><p>The award-winning illustrator Grady Klein has teamed up once again with the world&#x2019;s only stand-up economist, Yoram Bauman, Ph.D., to take on the daunting subject of calculus. A supplement to traditional textbooks, <i>The Cartoon Introduction to Calculus </i>focuses on the big ideas rather than all the formulas you have to memorize.</p><p>With Klein and Bauman as our guides, we scale the dual peaks of Mount Derivative and Mount Integral, and from their summits, we see how calculus relates to the rest of mathematics. Beginning with the problems of speed and area, Klein and Bauman show how the discipline is unified by a fundamental theorem. We meet geniuses like Archimedes, Liu Hui, and Bonaventura Cavalieri, who survived the slopes on intuition but prepared us for the avalanche-like dangers posed by mathematical rigor. Then we trek onward and scramble through limits and extreme values, optimization and integration, and learn how calculus can be applied to economics, physics, and so much more. We discover that calculus isn&#x2019;t the pinnacle of mathematics after all, but its tools are foundational to everything that follows. Klein and Bauman round out the book with a handy glossary of symbols and terms, so you don&#x2019;t have to worry about mixing up constants and constraints.

Mark Lewis captures a dynamic era in which the empire reached its greatest geographical extent under Chinese rule, painting and ceramic arts flourished, women played a major role both as rulers and in the economy, and China produced its finest lyric poets in Wang Wei, Li Bo, and Du Fu.</p><p>The Chinese engaged in extensive trade on sea and land. Merchants from Inner Asia settled in the capital, while Chinese entrepreneurs set off for the wider world, the beginning of a global diaspora. The emergence of an economically and culturally dominant south that was controlled from a northern capital set a pattern for the rest of Chinese imperial history. Poems celebrated the glories of the capital, meditated on individual loneliness in its midst, and described heroic young men and beautiful women who filled city streets and bars.</p><p>Despite the romantic aura attached to the Tang, it was not a time of unending peace. In 756, General An Lushan led a revolt that shook the country to its core, weakening the government to such a degree that by the early tenth century, regional warlordism gripped many areas, heralding the decline of the Great Tang.</p></p><p><p>Mark Edward Lewis is Kwoh-Ting Li Professor in Chinese Culture at Stanford University.</p><p>Timothy Brook is Professor of History and Republic of China Chair at the University of British Columbia.</p>&#x201c;This is an impressive survey history of the Tang dynasty, concise and accessible. <i>China's Cosmopolitan Empire</i> is written so succinctly and clearly that it provides, to my knowledge, the best summary of the Tang period yet available in English.

Should therapists reserve a space for make-believe only when nothing is at stake, or might it be precisely those moments when something truly matters that imagination is most urgently needed?</p><p>This book offers an alternative to therapeutic perspectives that treat children as vulnerable and helpless. It invites readers to consider how the imaginative gifts and knowledge of children, when supported by the therapist and family, can bring about dramatic change.</p><p>The book begins with an account of the foundations of narrative theory. It explains how such elements as language, characterization, and suspense contribute to the coherence of a story and bring young people into focus.</p><p>Each subsequent chapter provides specific suggestions for the practice of narrative therapy. Examples of the difficulties children face are offered, along with narrative interventions and tips for overcoming common barriers that can arise along the way. Readers will learn a variety of ready-to-implement strategies, including how to personify problems, compose letters to affirm children's identities, summon fairies to lend a helping hand, and many more. Sample dialogues between the authors, children, and their parents bring the application of each practice to life, illuminating how even the most stubborn problem can be outwitted, sometimes by mischievous means.</p><p>With robust professional insight,&nbsp;<em>Narrative Therapy in Wonderland</em> will aid any practitioner in calling on children's imaginative know-how. How often can a young person be spotted diving headlong into a world of fantasy? This book explores the extraordinary fact that these young people may, upon arrival in Wonderland, be far better equipped to take on even dire challenges than when they remain "up above."</p></p><p><p><strong>David Marsten</strong>,&nbsp;LCSW, is the director of the Miracle Mile Community Practice in Los Angeles.</p><p><strong>David Epston, M.A., C.Q.S.W.</strong> is coauthor of <em>Narrative Means to Therapeutic Ends</em> (1990) and <em>Playful Approaches to Serious Problems</em> (1997).

Through a series of beautifully narrated vignettes from clinical practice, it showcases imagination as an 'ideal traveling companion for young people.' It is not only pitch-perfect in balancing theory, compelling exemplar, and succinct advice for therapists and parents, but also compulsively readable, a compliment generally reserved for popular novels rather than professional texts.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Cheryl Mattingly, author of <i>The Paradox of Hope: Journeys through a Clinical Borderland</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This book is a treasure trove for therapists.

Vivid transcripts reveal the powers children have when their imagination, ingenuity, and sense of humor are engaged. Creativity is central to narrative therapy, as is moving past one-size-fits-all solutions. It is refreshing to learn how the creative capacities of each child and family can be channeled towards elegant and often unique resolution of the challenges they face, and to see the ''wonderfulness'' of the individual child so centrally featured. This book affirms the effectiveness of collaboration between adults and children in the realm of imaginary know-how.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jennifer Freeman, MFT, REAT, coauthor of <i>Playful Approaches to Serious Problems</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;More than a must-read for clinical professionals, and more than a supportive guide to parenting,&nbsp;<em>Narrative Therapy in Wonderland&nbsp;</em>is a book for anyone who faces Problems and seeks strategies for overcoming them.

I had written a couple of unpublished novels and a number of short stories before, published some pieces in magazines and newspapers, etc. I had been writing since I was a child, but I realized that I had never really written anything that I was completely happy with. Something was missing. I already felt that I was late in the game and that I had been wasting my time doing other things while I should have been focusing more seriously in my writing. I guess that, like many writers, I was just trying to find my own voice. Around that time I was working as a musician, although I knew that my "true" path, at least professionally, was in the writing. At some point I decided to drop everything and start working on this little novel, telling myself that this had to be "the one." Although I had never thought I would write for younger readers, the story seemed to me perfectly suited for that genre and, I suppose, I still hoped to be able to write something that would appeal to readers of all ages. I decided to try to write the book I would have liked to read when I was 12 or 13 years old. I worked quite hard on it, harder than I had worked on anything before. I remember writing at night over the summer of 1992 in Barcelona, from midnight till dawn. It was the summer of the Barcelona Olympics and it was hot and humid as hell. You can say I really sweated this one. I ended up having to buy this portable AC machine that I would point at my face while I was writing. I was fortunate in that the novel won an important literary award and became quite successful. It was the book that allowed me to become a professional writer and to start my career as a novelist, and I&#x2019;ve always been fond of it.</p> <b>What do you think are the most important differences when writing for adult readers and young adult readers? </b> <p>I don't think there're that many differences, really. You just have to write the best possible story in the most efficient way you are capable of. It is all about the language, the style, the atmosphere, the characters, the plot, the images and textures... If anything, I believe that younger readers are even more demanding and sincere about their feelings about what they're reading, and you have to be honest, never condescending. I don't think younger readers are an ounce less smart than adult ones. I think they are able to understand anything intellectually but perhaps there're emotional elements that they have not experienced in their lives yet, although they will eventually. Because of this, I think it is important to include a perspective in the work that allows them to find an emotional core that they can relate to not just intellectually. Other than that, I think you should work as hard as you can for your audience, respect them and try to bring the best of your craft to the table. My own personal view is that there&#x2019;s just good writing and bad writing. All other labels are, at least to me, irrelevant. </p> <b>In the novel, there are many references to watches, clocks and the passage of time. For instance, Max Carver, the central character, receives a pocket watch as a birthday gift from his watchmaker father. Its case is engraved with the words "Max's Time Machine." When the Carver family moves to a coastal town and arrives at the train station, Max observes that the train station clock is turning backwards. Why is the theme of time so important in the novel?</b> <p>Time is the thread of our lives, and in this story we see how events in the past, actions in our lives, have consequences later on. In some ways, we are the sum of our actions, our choices, our deeds. Life hands us a number of cards at the beginning of the game. We cannot choose them, but we can choose how we play them. That is an aspect that interests me very much and I try to explore it through the stories I write. I also believe that we are, to a certain extent, what we remember and the novel tries to reflect on these ideas as it jumps back and forth in time exploring the mystery at the heart of the novel.</p> <b>Without revealing too many secrets of your craft, what do you feel are the key ingredients of a spellbinding mystery?</b> <p>I think a good mystery story is just a good story, period. The key ingredients are the same as for any kind of good story: language, style, atmosphere, characterization, structure, imagery, subtext, etc. Good mysteries tend to be based on character rather than just on plot, but at the end of the day it is all in the writing actually.</p> <b>Max, Alicia and Roland are all teenagers, who are confronted with extraordinary and bewildering situations, and yet they don't immediately turn to adults for answers. Why not? </b> <p>Because I think that teenagers want their own answers. They need them. They need to understand the world around, and inside, themselves and they can only do that by finding out themselves the truth. Children rely on adults to tell them what the world is, and they usually get taken for a ride. A teenager knows, feels, the world is something she or he has to figure out.</p> <b>The novel's setting--a coastal town in a time of war&#x2014;is not very specific. Why not? </b> <p>I guess if you read between the lines you could guess the town is on the south coast of England during World War II. In the original version that was the case, but while I was revising the translation I decided to rewrite and redone certain parts and details and opted for a more generic location. I feel that what is important is that this is a story that happens in a place that we all can remember in our lives, and I wanted to emphasize that.</p> <b><i>The Prince of Mist</i> was an award winner and a bestseller in Spain, and has only recently reached an English-reading audience. What is the translation process and how were you involved in it?</b> <p>I am very involved in the translation process. I've been very lucky in that I've been working with the extremely talented Lucia Graves on the English translations of my novels. Lucia, who's a very accomplished novelist on her own, grew up in Spain and is completely bilingual. Our goal is to bring the reader a text that is exactly the same as the original in terms of flow, of texture, of pacing, of the music the prose makes. To that end we work very hard with Lucia and I often I'll rewrite sections or retouch things here and there to ensure that what you read in English is almost 100% what you would read in Spanish, without losing anything of the rhythm or the nuances in the flow of the language. I've noticed that sometimes readers, especially readers in English who are not very used to reading translations, tend to mystify the process and think that a translation is a rewrite or a reinvention of the original. It is not. A good translation is invisible and bring you exactly what was in the original, nothing more, nothing less.</p> <b>You divide your time between Barcelona and LA. Are the two cities reflected in your work?</b> <p>I think so. Barcelona is my hometown, the place I was born and grew up in. It is in my blood and I am very much a product of it. On the other hand, I've spent quite some time in California and I believe that a lot of my experiences here find their ways into the books. Writers use what they have at hand to write, what they have inside of them and what they see outside. We write about life, trying to figure it out and, hopefully, come up with something of value and beauty that we can share with the reader along the way.</p>Carlos Ruiz Zaf�n is the author of six novels, including the international phenomenon <em>The Shadow of the Wind</em>.

He served in the US navy in the second world war and lived briefly in Paris before returning to the US, where he wrote and supported himself with odd jobs. His incredibly varied books range from long experimental poems to a best-selling biography of General Custer, but he will be remembered above all for his two undisputed masterpieces about middle-class, suburban American life: Mrs Bridge and Mr Bridge. In 2009, he was nominated for the Man Booker International Prize for lifetime achievement, and in 2010, he was awarded a Los Angeles Times Book Prize. Evan S. Connell died in New Mexico on 10th January 2013, aged 88. Lionel Shriver grew up in North Carolina and currently lives in London. Her novels include We Need To Talk About Kevin, which won the 2005 Orange Prize and was made into a film in 2011. Her most recent book, The New Republic, came out in 2012.An exquisite tragedy in miniature -- Lionel Shriver Mr Bridge is a tour-de-force of contemporary American realism, a beautiful work of fiction * Life * With a delicate and subtle irony, Mr Connell shows us, first from her, then from his point of view, the little daily dramas of this ordinary family.

Yeshua (Christ) is born to Almah Mari (the Virgin Mary) after her union in Sacred Marriage at the Temple in Jerusalem with an unblemished man who kills himself as a sacrifice for his people. Later Mari Anath becomes Magdalene, or High Priestess of the Goddess, and assumes co-rule with Jehovah, succeeding Almah Mari. Mari Anath follows Yeshua in the years of his ministry, despite objections from some adherents who call her harlot because they oppose the double worship of the Goddess and Jehovah and the equality of sexes that relationship im plies. But days before the crucifixion, when Yeshua sacrifices himself, he and the Magdalene are united in Sacred Marriage in the Temple before the people. Mari Anath gives birth to Yeshua's daughter Anna after she and Judas (who is The Christos's twin brother and betrays him at his behest in order to fulfill the prophesy) flee to Gaul to make a new life. First novelist Kinstler, a professor of philosophy, mines the literature of myth to make this lyrically written interpretation plausible.

As Christmas descends upon the Falloden manor, the warmth of the season may yet melt away the trappings of duty and wealth, leaving behind only a man and a woman destined for each other&#x2019;s arms.</p><p><b>Mary Balogh</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of numerous books, including the acclaimed Slightly and Simply novels and the first five titles in her Huxtable series: <i>First Comes Marriage, Then Comes Seduction, At Last Comes Love, Seducing an Angel,</i> and <i>A Secret Affair</i>. A former teacher, she grew up in Wales and now lives in Canada.1<br><br>The Earl of Falloden glanced at the visiting card resting on the salver his butler held extended toward him. He frowned.<br><br>" 'Mr. Joseph Transome, coal merchant,' " he said. "Why the devil is a coal merchant calling upon me? Could you not have found out his business and sent him on his way, Starret?"<br><br>The butler exchanged a brief glance with the earl's valet. "He was most insistent, m'lord," he said. "He declared that he could divulge the purpose of his visit to no one but you. You wish me to say you are not at home, m'lord?"<br><br>"Yes," the earl said irritably, motioning his valet to hand him his neckcloth. He had just returned from a morning ride in the park that had done nothing to lift the gloom from his mind, that could do nothing to lift it. He was not in the mood for visitors.<br><br>The butler bowed stiffly from the waist and turned to leave his master's dressing room.<br><br>"Wait!" the earl said. He looked even more irritable as he tied his neckcloth in a hasty and simple knot despite the compressed lips of his disapproving valet. "The man is respectable, Starret? And he came to the front door?"<br><br>"He arrived in a carriage and four, m'lord," the man said.<br><br>The earl raised his eyebrows. "I had better see what the devil he wants," he said. "Show him into the salon, Starret."<br><br>"Yes, m'lord." The butler bowed again before withdrawing.<br><br>"A coal merchant," the earl said to his valet's reflected image. "What do you suppose he wants, eh, Crawley? To get me to change my supplier of coal for the winter? Who does supply it anyway? Well, I suppose I should go down and satisfy my curiosity. He came to the front door asking for me instead of to the back asking for Mrs. Lawford. Interesting, would you not say?"<br><br>But he did not wait for an answer. He strode from the room and descended the stairs to the hallway of his town house on Grosvenor Square. The gloom of an early November morning made it almost necessary to have lamps lit, he thought as he crossed the hall and waited for a footman to open the double doors into the salon. It was a day entirely in keeping with his general mood.<br><br>Mr. Joseph Transome, coal merchant, was a cit, he thought as the man turned from the window at the opening of the doors. He was as neatly and as expensively dressed as the earl himself, and altogether more fashionably. The earl had not been able to afford to keep up with the fashions for the past year, though most of that time he had been wearing mourning anyway. The only criticism he might make of the merchant's clothing was that it all looked as if it might be at least two sizes too large for the man. He was thin and angular, with a sharp, beaked face, from which eyes too dark and too large looked keenly at his host.<br><br>The earl nodded to him. "I am Falloden," he said. "What may I do for you?" He stiffened when the man did not immediately reply but looked him unhurriedly up and down and half smiled.<br><br>"You are a fine figure of a man, my lord, if you will forgive me for saying so," Mr. Transome said, rubbing his hands together. "Finer than I had been led to expect. That is good."<br><br>"I thank you," the earl said coldly. "Did you have any business you wished to discuss with me, sir?"<br><br>Mr. Transome laughed and continued to rub his hands together. "You would think it strange indeed if I had come for no other reason than to admire your appearance, my lord, now would you not?" he said. "But that is important to me too."<br><br>The earl pursed his lips, stood near the doors with his hands clasped at his back, and declined to offer his guest a seat.<br><br>"Perhaps I should come straight to the point, my lord," Mr. Transome said. "If the nobility is like the merchant classes, then time is money, as I always say. And time is not to be wasted on unnecessary chitchat."<br><br>"My sentiments exactly," the earl said.<br><br>"It seems, my lord," the merchant said, continuing to rub his hands as if washing them and looking apologetically at the earl, "that you are indebted to me for a considerable sum."<br><br>"Indeed?" The earl raised his eyebrows and looked haughtily at his visitor. "A household bill not paid, sir? I shall have you conducted to my housekeeper without further delay."<br><br>"No, no." Mr. Transome raised a staying hand. "Trifling stuff that would be, my lord, beneath your notice and beneath mine. Nothing like that. Your principal seat, Grenfell Park in Hampshire, is heavily mortgaged, I do believe, my lord?"<br><br>The earl's eyes sharpened.<br><br>"And the house and estate are getting shabbier and more dilapidated by the year with the rent money not even sufficient to pay off the mortgage costs," Mr. Transome continued.<br><br>"I do not know where you get your information," the earl said, "but Grenfell Park is no concern of yours, sir. If you will excuse me, I have a busy morning planned."<br><br>"Doing what, my lord, if I might make so bold as to ask?" Mr. Transome said. "Visiting your tailor or your bootmaker? You rarely do either these days since your bills at their establishments are already so high that you have no chance of paying them. And you are, when all is said and done, an honorable man. Or so my sources say."<br><br>"Mr. Transome." The earl's voice was icy. "I must ask you to leave, sir." He turned toward the doors.<br><br>"And you never visit Tattersall's these days, my lord, or attend the races." The merchant ignored the opening doors. "And you do not play deep at cards, already burdened as you are with gaming debts higher than you can hope to pay in your lifetime--though they are not your own, I might add in all fairness. And many of them debts owed to moneylenders, my lord. It is not a good situation. I daresay you do not sleep peacefully at night."<br><br>The earl closed the doors again and took a few steps across the room toward his visitor. "Mr. Transome," he said, "I take it there is some point to this impertinence. Would you kindly get to it before I throw you out of my house? And would you kindly inform me how I am in debt to you? Something my cousin's man of business knew nothing of?"<br><br>"Nothing like that, my lord," Mr. Transome said, his voice soothing. "I daresay you know the full extent of your debts. And they are sufficient to weigh on your shoulders as heavily as that mountain did on that giant's shoulders. What's-his-name. I always liked that story."<br><br>"Atlas," the earl said curtly. "I wonder how heavily you will weigh on my shoulders, Mr. Transome, when I transport you to my door in a moment's time."<br><br>The merchant chuckled. "Not much, my lord," he said. "Not much these days. You now owe me all those debts, my lord. I bought 'em all. Every last one of them."<br><br>The earl froze. And strangely, he did not doubt for a moment that the man spoke the truth. All those debts his cousin and predecessor had incurred in eight years as Earl of Falloden. Those debts he had refused to repudiate when he had inherited fourteen months before. And he had refused to sell Grenfell Park with its vast estates because it had been his childhood home. Because it was in his blood, a part of him, his most treasured possession. A millstone about his neck.<br><br>"Why?" he asked, his eyes narrowing.<br><br>"Why did I buy 'em?" Mr. Transome asked. "To do you a favor, my lord. It is better, less confusing, I always think, to owe money all in one place than all over London and the southern counties. Would you not agree, my lord?"<br><br>"I find the thought enormously comforting," the earl said. "So you have come to put the squeeze on me, Transome? You are going to have to wait. I will pay off every penny of the debt eventually. But it will take time."<br><br>Mr. Transome laughed. "I have worked hard all my life, my lord," he said. "Through diligence and a little good luck too, I have amassed almost everything a man could want in this life. Only one thing I have very little of, and it is the very commodity you ask of me. Time. I have very little time."<br><br>"Then," the earl said, "I shall have to reconcile my mind to debtors' prison, I suppose. I am sorry, sir, but I cannot reach into a pocket and bring out the sum I owe you. I wish I could. Believe me."<br><br>"I do, my lord," the merchant said, resuming his old occupation of rubbing his hands together. "But your debts can be canceled in a moment, my lord."<br><br>The earl smiled arctically.<br><br>"You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours, so to speak," Mr. Transome said. "You do something for me, my lord, and I'll cancel your debt. Every last penny of it. And make sure that you have the wherewithal to make Grenfell Park one of the showpieces of England and its farms the most prosperous. And to spend some time and money at your tailor's again."<br><br>The earl raised his eyebrows.<br><br>"You are waiting to hear what it is you must do for me," Mr. Transome said. "It is a small something, my lord, in exchange for what you will get in return. But it will mean a great deal to me."<br><br>The earl did not change his expression.<br><br>"I will cancel your debts and settle half of my fortune on you, my lord--and it is a considerable fortune," the man said, "if you will marry my daughter. And most of the remaining half of my fortune will be hers after my death and so in effect will be yours too."<br><br>The Earl of Falloden stared in disbelief at his visitor. "You want me to marry your daughter," he said faintly, wondering for a moment if he had walked into some strange dream. A cit's daughter. A coal merchant's daughter. A total stranger.<br><br>"She is nineteen years old and a beauty, even if I do say so myself," Mr. Transome said. "And if it is refinement you want, my lord, you cannot do better than my Ellie. I had her educated at Miss Tweedsmuir's academy. Two lords' daughters were there at the same time and a colonel's daughter too. She was particular friends with Lord Hutchins's girl."<br><br>"How do you know I am not married already?" the earl asked coldly. "No, disregard that question. I do not have a doubt that you know everything about my life, sir. Doubtless you know of my attachment, though not betrothal, to Miss Dorothea Lovestone. Doubtless you know of the mistress I have had in keeping for a year past."<br><br>"Miss Alice Freeman," Mr. Transome said. "And a beauty she is too, if you don't mind my saying so, my lord. She is a credit to your good taste. But then so will Ellie be. You will have her beauty and her refinement and education and half my fortune, my lord. And she will be your countess. She will bear you the heir to Grenfell Park and your earldom. It is all I ask, my lord." He chuckled. "To be grandfather to an earl."<br><br>"Mr. Transome," the earl said quietly, "get out of my house."<br><br>The merchant scratched his balding head. "I understand that you are a man of pride, my lord," he said. "What member of the peerage is not? And I know that it goes against the grain, so to speak, to consider marrying into the merchant classes. But sometimes necessity must swallow up pride. I really cannot see that you have any alternative to what I have suggested."<br><br>"Debtors' prison," the earl said curtly. "That is an alternative, sir."<br><br>"You have not even seen my Ellie," Mr. Transome said. "How can you be sure you would prefer prison, my lord? And I cannot believe you are serious. It is bravado. But even without prison, what is there ahead of you in life? You have not been able to offer for Miss Lovestone, have you, my lord, even though you have the title to dangle in front of her papa's eyes? You are too proud to offer her marriage while you are debt-ridden. But if you will pardon me for saying so, you will be an old man or perhaps even a man in his grave before you are free to offer. It is doubtful that her papa would accept you anyway, since he is not himself a wealthy man."<br><br>"My relationship with Miss Lovestone is entirely my own concern," the earl said.<br><br>"Quite so," his visitor agreed. "But you were the first to mention her name, my lord. Let me be brief, since I see that you are eager to bring this interview to an end. You must marry my daughter within the month, my lord, or I shall call in my debts within the same month. I would hate to do it, but business is business."<br><br>The earl set his hand on the knob of a door. "Allow me to show you out," he said.<br><br>"I shall call tomorrow, my lord," Mr. Transome said. "I cannot wait any longer. I trust you will think carefully of your decision."<br><br>"There is nothing to think of," the earl said, opening the doors and motioning his guest to precede him into the hallway. "You will be wasting your time returning here, sir. I will bid you a good morning."<br><br>"Until tomorrow, then, my lord," Mr. Transome said, taking his coat and hat from a footman. "I believe that in the course of one whole day and one whole night you will see that in all wisdom you have only one possible course. And it will be a good one, I can promise you. I have chosen you with care, since I will be entrusting to you my dearest fortune of all."<br><br>"Good day to you, sir," the earl said, and he nodded to the footman to open the door and turned away himself to climb the stairs.<br><br>He felt rather, he thought, as a condemned man must feel when climbing the steps to the scaffold.</p><h2>Gadsby: A Story of Over 50,000 Words Without Using the Letter &#x201c;E&#x201d;</h2><p>Written from the perspective of a self-deprecating narrator, 'Gadsby' is - at its core - a tale of a town in a state of concerted rebirth. In an effort to reverse the plight of the place that he calls home, the protagonist organizes the town's youth. In doing so, we watch as the small piece of suburbia becomes a shining beacon of what towns can - and perhaps should - be. Once established, we are led through a series of years, ever bearing witness to the idealism of the organized youth, and the results of their labors. While not a particularly compelling story, the reverence for this work of narrative art is not diminished. What makes this book notable is the ridiculously difficult challenge in crafting that it presents, and the time, effort, and passion it must have taken to give rise to such a thing. It is an overt, Quixotic flaunting against the word &#x2018;impossible&#x2019;.</p><p></p><h2>The Wall Street Journal Complete Estate-Planning Guidebook (Wall Street Journal Guides)</h2><p>Let&#x2019;s face it: you can't avoid death or taxes.

I&#x2019;ll also help you decode the technical jargon that estate planners often use, so you feel comfortable discussing QTIPs and QPRTs when you sit down with your lawyer.&nbsp; <br><br>Some situations require more complicated planning, so in special sections throughout the book, called &#x201c;<b>A Deeper Look</b>,&#x201d; we&#x2019;ll talk about how to handle your estate if you&#x2019;re single, in an unmarried or same-sex relationship, in a remarriage, or have a family member who is disabled or has special needs and you serve as a family caregiver. We&#x2019;ll also address the growing &#x201c;asset protection&#x201d; industry, which seeks to shield estates from the hands of creditors or divorcing spouses.&nbsp; And since many of us are pet owners, we&#x2019;ll discuss how to plan for our furry friends.<br><br>In the first chapter<b>, Getting Started</b>, we&#x2019;ll cover key steps you should take before you and your lawyer draft your will, trust and other documents. Here, I will help you figure out your estate planning goals, take stock of your possessions, and provide strategies for talking these ideas over with your family. This chapter also offers guidance on how to choose a lawyer and other estate advisers. Clarifying your estate planning objectives, and discussing them with your family, will likely save you money and time&#x2014;and minimize arguments&#x2014;in the long run. <br><br>We&#x2019;ll also provide information here about key estate planning steps to take at different stages in your life, and in a special section in this chapter, we&#x2019;ll take a deeper look at estate-planning tactics if you&#x2019;re single or in an unmarried or same-sex relationship.<br><br><b>Chapter Two, Death and Taxes</b>, explains how estate, gift and generation-skipping taxes work and introduces some strategies to help minimize them. Under current law, these taxes affect just a small number of people, but it&#x2019;s still important to understand how they work. <br><br>In <b>Chapter Three, Wills</b>, you&#x2019;ll learn why a will is the centerpiece of most estate plans and we&#x2019;ll go over some strategies to ensure that your money and belongings are left in the way that you choose.&nbsp; We&#x2019;ll discuss how to choose an executor and I&#x2019;ll explain the responsibilities of the role. We&#x2019;ll also go over when it may make sense to say &#x201c;no&#x201d; to an inheritance. We&#x2019;ll talk about how some estate plans may be equitable, but not necessarily equal&#x2014;and I&#x2019;ll offer some ideas about how to balance out bequests and gifts to heirs who may have very different economic and family circumstances.<br><br>While a will is an essential part of any estate plan, not all of your assets are governed by the terms of your will.&nbsp; In <b>Chapter Four, Probate and Ways to Avoid It</b>, I&#x2019;ll explain how some key assets -- including retirement plans, insurance policies, certain jointly-owned property, and some trusts -- don&#x2019;t pass through wills and aren&#x2019;t subject to the legal process of probate. (Probate is a time-consuming court procedure that divides up your property as directed by your will.)&nbsp; I&#x2019;ll help you make sure your property goes to your intended heirs. We&#x2019;ll also talk about how to pass on Individual Retirement Accounts, or IRAs, which are subject to all sorts of complex rules. <br><br><b>Chapter Five, Trusts</b>, discusses how trusts work. Contrary to popular belief, you don&#x2019;t need to be a Rockefeller to create a trust. In fact, many people without significant wealth use trusts for a variety of reasons, such as avoiding the hassles and expense of probate or providing for young children. You&#x2019;ll learn about the pros and cons of naming a family member or a financial services firm as your trustee and how to choose the right place to set up your trust. &nbsp;This chapter also includes a detailed &#x201c;trust tip sheet,&#x201d; that decodes the alphabet soup of trust lingo that you may hear from your lawyer. I&#x2019;ll teach you how to structure trusts for minor children and spouses, how to create tax-saving trusts and how to pass your house on to heirs through a trust. In a special section in this chapter, we&#x2019;ll take a deeper look at how to use trusts and other tactics to protect your assets from creditors and lawsuits.&nbsp; <br><br>In <b>Chapter Six, Life Insurance</b>, we&#x2019;ll go over this valuable tool for providing for your family&#x2019;s future. We&#x2019;ll discuss the differences between term and permanent life insurance and how to best structure your life insurance policy to reduce estate taxes. And we&#x2019;ll go over some basic insurance, tax and estate-planning strategies for passing on family businesses. <br><br><b>Chapter Seven, Philanthropy</b>, discusses charitable giving, and how such generosity doesn&#x2019;t just help important causes; it also can help you reduce taxes and provide for your family members. We&#x2019;ll talk about different ways to make charitable gifts, including direct bequests and charitable trusts, and I&#x2019;ll explain the pros and cons of setting up your own charitable foundation. <br><br>In <b>Chapter Eight, Preparing for the Unthinkable</b>, we&#x2019;ll discuss other key estate-planning documents you&#x2019;ll need. These include papers naming a guardian for your children, as well as powers of attorney for finances and health, crucial documents which name agents to make financial and medical decisions for you if you&#x2019;re unable to do so yourself. In a section in this chapter, we&#x2019;ll take a deeper look at planning for family members with special needs. We&#x2019;ll also talk about making funeral and burial plans. And we&#x2019;ll address how to plan for your pets&#x2019; care when you are not around. <br><br>In <b>Chapter Nine: Preserving Family Harmony</b>, we&#x2019;ll go over some ways to help strengthen your estate plans to help prevent family feuds and challenges, especially when you&#x2019;re no longer around to voice your wishes. Here, we&#x2019;ll talk about feud de-fusers such as mediation, arbitration and &#x201c;no-contest&#x201d; clauses, which disinherit heirs if they protest your will. We&#x2019;ll address some estate planning strategies for blended families who are in second and third marriages and may have both children and stepchildren. I&#x2019;ll give you ideas for dividing up personal property, such as jewelry and heirlooms. That tangible stuff with sentimental value often causes more rifts than cash. And we&#x2019;ll take a deeper look at an unusual, but effective way, to help keep family harmony: paying family members for their caregiving contributions if you or your spouse were to become incapacitated. <br><br>At this point you&#x2019;ll have learned how to draw up your will, trust and other estate documents. Congratulations! But you&#x2019;re not quite done yet. You still need to create a system for taking care of your estate plan over time. That&#x2019;s where <b>Chapter Ten: Maintaining Your Plan</b>, comes in. We&#x2019;ll go over the &#x201c;care and feeding&#x201d; of your estate plan &#x2013; how to store it and when to update it, and the importance of keeping your plans flexible.&nbsp; <br><br>In short, this book should provide you with the information you need to ensure that when you&#x2019;re gone, your hard-earned money goes where you want it to. That said, if your finances or family situations are unusually complex or your spouse or heirs are non-U.S. citizens, I highly recommend also getting tailor-made legal and tax advice from qualified advisers who specialize in estate planning. <br>The more you plan ahead, the lower the chances of divisive family brawls and surprise tax bills. What&#x2019;s more, when you educate yourself about estate planning, you can reduce the number of expensive hours you spend with your lawyer and avoid sketchy tax-shelters and other shams.&nbsp; <br><br>As you work through the <i>Wall Street Journal Complete Estate-Planning Guidebook</i>, rest assured that although you can&#x2019;t evade death or taxes, you can create an estate plan that will make both a whole lot easier for your loved ones. Your family will thank you for it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><br></p><h2>Duns Scotus - Philosophical Writings: A Selection</h2><p><p>The philosophical writings of Duns Scotus, one of the most influential philosophers of the Later Middle Ages, are here presented in a volume that presents the original Latin with facing page English translation.<br><b>CONTENTS:&nbsp;</b></p><p>Foreword to the Second Edition.

And my need is dire.&#x201d;<br><br>This stark revelation is the path to divine surrender. Our courage has a chance to flourish when we reach a point where we have no control and nothing to lose.<br><br>In a series of letters, Rebecca Reynolds uses imagery to breathe truth to the lonely, the weary, the restless, and afraid. If you feel the ache of brokenness, you will be refreshed by the source of all courage illuminated in these pages. God is available and wants to join you, in the midst of any mess. You can take heart. As Aslan of Narnia whispered (and only Lucy heard), <i>Courage, dear heart</i>.</p><p>I love this book, partly because I see myself in almost every page&#x2015;my clumsy, halting, constantly faltering daily walk with God&#x2015;but mostly because I recognize the gospel in almost every page: God&#x2019;s mercy, patience, persistence, and faithfulness laid out in the most imaginative ways. This book is a wonderful accomplishment and an excellent read. (Fernando Ortega, singer-songwriter)<br><br>To read this book is to take a journey. The eyes of your soul will open widely, and you will blink in wonder at how you had never seen what you see now. Rebecca Reynolds takes in hand language, literature, science, philosophy, theology, and her own life experience to explore those foundational questions that haunt and confuse us. Enjoy your journey! (Sarah Van Diest, author of God in the Dark)<br><br>Wisdom and compassion illuminate every beautiful sentence of this gospel-infused book. I love that Rebecca Reynolds chose the title <i>Courage, Dear Heart</i>. She&#x2019;s one of the most courageous people I know, and her heart is one of the dearest. I hope this is the first of many books from her. (Jonathan Rogers, bestselling author)<br><br>In <i>Courage, Dear Heart</i>, Reynolds enters into the depths of each reader&#x2019;s messy human experience and puts her arm around them in friendship, offering compassion, wisdom, and hope. Reynolds speaks to all readers as a close friend, immersing them in a rich narrative saturated with poetry, literary excerpts, Scripture, and authentic, sometimes painfully honest stories from her life and ministry. <i>Courage, Dear Heart</i> is the rare book that not only keeps vigil with readers in the shadows of their struggles but also compassionately walks beside them as they move once again toward the light. I am certain I will return to it many times to experience the grace woven into each paragraph of this wonderful book. (Joel Clarkson, author and composer)<br><br>Written with imagination and compassion, these letters to a weary world will bring renewed vision and some much-needed courage to their readers. (Malcolm Guite, poet and singer-songwriter)<br><br>Rebecca Reynolds is one of the most perceptive and enjoyable writers I&#x2019;ve ever read. In <i>Courage, Dear Heart</i>, her exceptional honesty, clarity, and willingness to engage with God in hard things shine through each page. This is not a dry tome. These are word pictures of God and his workings to brighten everyday life. (Ron Block, instrumentalist and vocalist with Alison Krauss and Union Station)</p><h2>Scheherazade (Dover Orchestral Music Scores)</h2><p><p>It is one of the world's most beloved symphonic compositions &#x2014; a shimmering, evocative musical treatment of the legend of <i>Scheherazade</i>. Composed in 1888 by Nikolay Rimsky-Koraskov (1844&#x2013;1908), Russian master of orchestration and luminous tone-painting, <i>Scheherazade</i> re-creates the legend of the Sultan Schahriar, who, convinced of the perfidy and faithlessness of women, vowed to execute each of his wives after the first night. But the Sultana Scheherazade saved her life by telling the Sultan fascinating stories for 1001 nights, staving off her demise by keeping the sanguinary ruler in a state of suspense over the outcome of the tales she told.<br>Considered a masterpiece of "program" music, <i>Scheherazade</i> is imbued with exotic Near Eastern moods and the subtle flavor of Russian folk music. The musical "Program" contains four parts: <br>I. The sea and Sinbad's ship<br>II. The story of the prince-kalandar<br>III. The young prince and the princess<br>IV. Festival in Baghdad. The sea. The ship breaks up against a cliff surmounted by a bronze horseman. Conclusion.<br>This Dover edition is an unabridged and unaltered republication of the score originally published by M. P. Belaieff in Leipzig. It contains every note of the original composition in large, clear notation, as well as a new English translation of the "Program." Musicians, students, musicologists, and any music lover will welcome this sturdy, inexpensive study score of one of the landmarks of the classical repertoire.</p><p></p></p><p>Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (1844&#x2013;1908) was a prolific composer of orchestral works and many other forms of music, including chamber works and art songs. He also wrote many operas, excerpts from which are featured in this collection; most notably, "The Flight of the Bumblebee" from <i>The Tale of Tsar Saltan.</i></p><h2>Uncommon Decency: Christian Civility in an Uncivil World</h2><p>Can Christians act like Christians even when they disagree? In these wild and diverse times, right and left battle over the airwaves, prolifers square off against prochoicers, gay liberationists confront champions of the traditional family, artists and legislators tangle, even Christians fight other Christians whose doctrines aren't "just so." Richard Mouw has been actively forging a model of Christian civil conversation with those we might disagree with&#x2015;atheists, Muslims, gay activists and more. He is concerned that, too often, Christians have contributed more to the problem than to the solution. But he recognizes&#x2015;from his dialogues with those from many perspectives&#x2015;that it's not easy to hold to Christian convictions and treat sometimes vindictive opponents with civility and decency. Few if any people in the evangelical world have conversed as widely and sensitively as Mouw. So few can write more wisely or helpfully than Mouw does here about what Christians can appreciate about pluralism, the theological basis for civility, and how we can communicate with people who disagree with us on the issues that matter most.</p><p><strong>Richard J. Mouw</strong> is president of Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, and professor of Christian philosophy. His many books include <em>The Smell of Sawdust, He Shines in All That's Fair, Calvinism in the Las Vegas Airport</em> and most recently, <em>Praying at Burger King.</em>"Dr. Mouw models wisdom, humility, compassion and civility--and he does so without compromising the convictions of his beliefs. . . if every Christian household took the words of Uncommon Decency to heart, our lights would shine so much more brightly in a nation that urgently needs an image of Christ-like citizenship from our body of believers." (Dwight Baker, Christian Retailing, December 2011)<br><br>"A powerful read with a stronger message, very highly recommended." (James A. Cox, The Midwest Book Review, November 2010)<br><br>"This book is right on target and just in time--when Christians in the same churches and denominations have trouble talking to one another. Spiritual leaders in these churches and denominations need to embody and practice it." (Southwestern Journal of Theology)<br><br>"A convincing case. . . . We can think of so many people who need to read this book, even as we suspect most of them think it would do us a heap of good. They're probably right." (First Things)<br><br>"Mouw convincingly argues that the need for civility is pressing. The virtue is nearly extinct. Civility is a Christian virtue whereby we enter public discussions with a strong conviction of Christian truth, a willingness to learn from those with whom we disagree, and a desire to honor the humanity of even our fiercest foe. Civility is not a passive politeness that defers to everyone and stands for nothing. Neither is it relativistic. It is a mannerly demeanor in which an inner intensity never overpowers self-restraint or rational discourse. . . . The book articulates an urgent message Christians should take to heart." (Christianity Today)<br><br>"<em>Uncommon Decency</em> is an arousing call to Christians everywhere that our deepest convictions have to be tempered with civility, especially in this time of increasing partisan rancor and cultural division. To those who want to truly transform the world, Mouw reminds us that we will be most effective when we persuade others with patience, tolerance and compassion." (D. Michael Lindsay, author of Faith in the Halls of Power)<br><br>"Although populism is by no means the only source of today's toxic political discourse, it has often done more to fan flames of resentment than to model civil disagreement. <em>Uncommon Decency</em> should be required reading not only for politicians, talk show hosts, and public intellectuals but also for everyday Christians seeking to represent the Lord faithfully in public."

The neon-lit streets, mobbed-up joints and seedy rooming houses portrayed in his fiction were real places, familiar to Angelenos of the time, and in some cases recognisable today. <br><br>This is a guide to the world of Raymond Chandler and his noble alter-ego, the private detective Philip Marlowe. It mixes locations from the books, the films and Chandler's personal life. There's the crummy dive where Moose Malloy went looking for Velma; the actual lounge where Marlowe and Terry Lennox ordered gimlets; the top-floor suite where oil executive Chandler got his priceless education in how a dirty, sun-drenched city really operated. This is the Los Angeles that Raymond Chandler carried in his heart. And now, you can too.</p><p>Crime historian and novelist Kim Cooper is co-creator and co-host of the Esotouric bus tours Raymond Chandler&#39;s Los Angeles, The Birth of Noir and The Real Black Dahlia. Her novel &#34;The Kept Girl&#34; follows the young Raymond Chandler on the trail of a real-life cult of angel worshippers in 1920s Southern California. When the third generation Angeleno isn&#39;t combing old newspapers for forgotten scandals, she is a passionate advocate for historic preservation of signage, vernacular architecture and writer&#39;s homes. Kim was for many years the editrix of Scram, a journal of unpopular culture. Her books include &#34;How To Find Old Los Angeles,&#34; &#34;Fall in Love For Life: Inspiration from a 73-Year Marriage,&#34; &#34;Bubblegum Music is the Naked Truth,&#34; &#34;Lost in the Grooves,&#34; and an oral history of Neutral Milk Hotel.</p><h2>Batavia&#39;s Graveyard: The True Story of the Mad Heretic Who Led History&#39;s Bloodiest Mutiny</h2><p>In 1628 the Dutch East India Company loaded the Batavia, the flagship of its fleet, with a king&#x2019;s ransom in gold, silver, and gems for her maiden voyage to Java; the ship itself was a tangible symbol of the world&#x2019;s richest and most powerful monopoly. <br><br>The company also sent along a new employee to guard its treasure. He was Jeronimus Corneliszoon, a disgraced and bankrupt man with great charisma and dangerously heretical ideas. With the help of a few disgruntled sailors, he hatched a plot to seize the ship and her riches. The mutiny might have succeeded, but in the dark morning hours of June 3, 1629, the Batavia smashed through a coral reef and ran aground on a small chain of islands near Australia. The captain and skipper escaped the wreck, and in a tiny lifeboat they set sail for Java&#x2014;some 1,500 miles north&#x2014;to summon help. More than 250 frightened survivors waded ashore, thankful to be alive. Unfortunately, Jeronimus and the mutineers had survived too, and the nightmare was only beginning.</p><p>In 1629, the Dutch merchantman <i>Batavia</i> grounded on a desolate atoll near Western Australia. Of the 200 survivors, 115 were subsequently murdered, in coldest blood, by a group of the ship's sailors and their psychopathic leader, Jeronimus Corneliszoon. <i>Batavia's Graveyard</i> is Mike Dash's unnerving, measured account of the incident. The victims included children, babies, and pregnant women; the crimes took place over a period of several months. Though the killings make a substantial, chilling tale in themselves, Dash adroitly places the shocking spree in larger context with illuminating discussions of 17th century medical practices, religious heresy, global politics, and shipboard sociology and daily life. Additionally, he draws dozens of portraits of the participants in this ghastly drama, most fascinatingly that of Corneliszoon, who emerges as a grotesquely charismatic predecessor of the likes of Charles Manson and Ted Bundy. <i>Batavia's Graveyard</i>, a skillful melding of accessible scholarship and evenhanded narrative and of overview and telling detail, is a welcome achievement. <i>--H. O'Billovitch</i>&#x201c;Brilliantly crafted, deeply researched . . . a gruesome and powerfully written history.

He was more interested in pop culture than Great Books and performed only the bare minimum to pass. By age 27, however, he began work at a different classical institution, teaching the same literature he merely skimmed as a student. Ten years later, Gibbs has become a popular blogger and frequent speaker at education conferences. In this series of frank reflections on an unlikely career, Gibbs contemplates what it means to be a good teacher, how Great Books can change lives (and how one particular book, The Consolation of Philosophy by Boethius, changed his), and why effective education is primarily concerned with the acquisition of virtue. One part literary guidebook, one part personal memoir, and one part teacher s manual, How to Be Unlucky presents a one-of-a-kind case for ancient ways of thinking about teaching in our contemporary world.</p><p>Joshua Gibbs teaches great books at Veritas School in Richmond, VA. His wife is generous and his children are funny.How To Be Unlucky is a much needed book, a book which will prove spiritually and intellectually valuable to teachers, students, and parents alike. This book stands to significantly change the way you think of education. Look away from the glitzy shallows of your smartphone and dive into the deep end with Joshua Gibbs. As a professor, I'd love for all of my colleagues -- and as a dad, I want all of my kids' teachers -- to be drinking deeply of the ideas Joshua Gibbs is tackling in How to Be Unlucky. Our rising generation obviously needs to be wrestling more regularly with both the theory and practice of virtue, but how can we get them to want to? Mere moralistic lecturing probably makes the outcome we seek less rather than more likely, so what is to be done? Well, here's some good news: Both wit and wise counsel -- and an introductory guide to the ancients, and some self-deprecation about Gibbs's own failures, and even meaningful reflection on '90s rock -- all await you in these important pages." --<b>Senator Ben Sasse, author of The Vanishing American Adult</b><br><br>With poetic, honest, and compelling prose, How to Be Unlucky calls readers to reject the siren songs of material success and worldly pleasures, and to pursue instead the only things that matter: wisdom, virtue, and godliness. The world needs more books like this and more of the virtues Joshua Gibbs teaches and models in these pages. --<b>Karen Swallow Prior, author of On Reading Well</b><br><br>Reading Joshua Gibbs is thought-provoking, challenging, inspiring, and withal, practical. This book made me want to go back to high school and sit in his class. Finally! A teacher who understands that teaching great books, big ideas, critical thinking, writing techniques, and all that are simply means to the end of practicing virtue and laying up treasure in heaven. Had I read this book when I started teaching, I would have been a much better (and more honest and brave) teacher. --<b>David Hicks, author of Norms and Nobility</b></p><h2>Alma and the Beast</h2><p><b>Alma's beautiful, hairy world is turned upside down by the arrival of a stranger.

Yet Thurman's importance goes well beyond his influence on Martin Luther King, Jr. and others in the freedom struggle. His spiritual gifts and dreams, as well as his unique response to his troubled times, were as extraordinarily creative as they were vast and far-reaching.<br><br>This collection of fifteen of Thurman's unpublished sermons on the parables of Jesus captures the power of the parables to challenge, transform, and inspire us to declare or reaffirm our commitment to the reign of God and the human community proclaimed by Jesus.</p><p><b>David B.

A return to the simple abundance of Italy&#x2019;s past!</p> <p>Ah, if only it were true. If there was a glorious yesteryear of Italian feasting, it was enjoyed only by society&#x2019;s elite. As for standard, rustic fare, such meals bore little resemblance to what is now considered&#x2014;even in Italy&#x2014;traditional Italian food.</p> <p>Determined to separate out the folklore from the fakelore and reveal the intriguing yet uncelebrated past of Italian foodways, food historian Karima Moyer-Nocchi interviewed Italian "ninetysomething" women from various walks of life, from charcoal-makers to countesses. Her travels spanned from the far north to the deep south, as well as Italy's former landholdings. All of the interviewees had lived through the harrowing years called the Ventennio fascista, the twenty-year reign of fascism in Italy, and were eager to have their final say.</p> <p>What follows are eighteen remarkable oral narratives, each building upon the last to create a mosaic of Italian foodways, from the fascist era through to the post World War II boom, the &#x201c;Dolce Vita.&#x201d; Each woman contributes a recipe chosen specifically to reflect what food was like when she was growing up under Mussolini. The narratives are separated by astringent, yet entertaining essay briefs, illuminating various aspects of gastronomic history and daily life in fascist Italy.</p> <p>Engrossing and engaging, <i>Chewing the Fat</i> gently debunks the myths of Italy&#x2019;s gastronomic nostalgia industry, revealing a culture of food that is surprisingly different from the image most people have of Italian cuisine.</p> <p>"A remarkable insight into the realities of Italian food. This book lays bare the multiple dimensions of Italian gastronomy: geography, politics, social background, education and economics. It is an eloquent dissection of the nuances of the world&#x2019;s favorite cooking as well as a magical exercise in memory. A brilliant reconstruction of the kitchens and cookery (and much else besides) of a previous generation."</p> <p>-Tom Jaine, Food writer, publisher, critic, and restaurateur </p><p>"Moyer-Nocchi succeeds in conveying a world that needs to be remembered and appreciated in its complexity. There were no heroes or villains, just people struggling to survive. It is always important to know where we come from to have a more objective and informed vision of who we are."</p> <p>Fabio Parasecoli - Huffington Post </p><p>"This is a book to read from cover to cover, as the carefully crafted structure reveals a much more complex narrative than just a few interviews with old ladies, and chats on past foodways. Karima Moyer-Nocchi is one of a new generation of historians intent on redressing the balance of Italian food history, putting cherished myths into proper perspective."</p> <p>Gillian Riley - author of <i>The Oxford Companion to Italian Food<i></i></i></p></p><p><p>A professor in the modern languages department at the University of Siena in Tuscany, Italy, Karima Moyer-Nocchi has made Italy her home for over twenty-five years. As an enthusiastic food historian, she travels extensively through Italy studying the social, economic, and cultural factors that characterize cuisine in each region of the country. She is a frequent lecturer in Food Studies both in Italy and abroad. </p> <p>The author presently resides in Citt� di Castello, Umbria, with her husband.</p>Chewing the Fat is a step away from the Italian food history we think we know. Moyer-Nocchi artfully combines historical research with oral history to peel away the heroic myths and show the everyday work (and workers) of Italy&#x2019;s gastronomic past. <br> - Zachary Nowak, Assoc.

A wife, mom, amateur chef, Fix-It Mistress, and cider enthusiast, she earned her MA in English Literature and serves on her local library&#x2019;s board of directors.The Simplicity of Cider CHAPTER ONE<p></p> <br>Sanna Lund&#x2019;s thoughts of apple blossoms and new cider blends stuttered to an end with the grunt of her dad&#x2019;s snore. Einars rumbled from the squashy armchair in front of the huge fieldstone fireplace framed by large picture windows, afternoon sun blanketing him. The stones had come from their orchard, unearthed when the first generation of Lunds began planting the orchard four generations ago. The stones varied in color and shape, from light gray limestone to rusty red granite, each highlighted by the golden light. Above the inset wooden mantel hung a huge collage of watercolor paintings, comprised of six-inch squares, each showcasing a different variety of apple grown in the orchard set against a distinguishing hue.<br> <br>Sanna closed the refrigerator and set on the kitchen counter the baggie of sticks she&#x2019;d been retrieving and walked across the huge great room to where her dad slept. His long legs stretched out in front of him, like roots expanding their reach. Everything about him was stretched, like taffy pulled slightly too far. His head tilted back enough for his gaping mouth to emit another snort. An open shoe box full of weathered photos and yellowing paper sat on his lap, while he clutched a single photo to his chest.<br> <br>An afternoon nap was a common enough scene in other homes, but Sanna couldn&#x2019;t remember ever watching her father sleep. Einars was a man of action, always in the middle of three different chores at once, making it all seem effortless. Age spots dotted his face from too many years in the sun before sunscreen was as recommended as the proverbial apple, wrinkles traced exactly where his smile would be if he were awake, and fluttering eyelids hid his sparkling blue eyes. Dark smudges pooled under his pale eyelashes, evidence of the late-night pacing that had become a habit during the last year. Sanna shoved away her guilt that she might be partially to blame for that, deep into the mental cave normally reserved for what people thought of her, dawdling tourists, and small talk.<br> <br>When he&#x2019;d come in from the trees, he had told her he would start their dinner. That was forty-five minutes ago. Sanna had been so immersed in grafting old branches to new trees, she hadn&#x2019;t noticed how long he&#x2019;d been gone. If she hadn&#x2019;t come in to retrieve the scions&#x2014;the twigs from older trees she was hoping to graft&#x2014;from the house fridge, she wouldn&#x2019;t have found him dozing.<br> <br>Thinking she should wake him, Sanna smiled down at the man who was her world. He&#x2019;d taken care of her through colds, puberty, growing pains that would have knocked an elephant to its knees. He taught her how to climb a tree, determine the exact right day to pick an apple, drive a stick-shift truck through the bumpy aisles of an orchard, and dip crispy french fries into her chocolate shakes from Wilson&#x2019;s. She pulled the picture he was gripping out of his long fingers and glanced at the faded image, then dropped it as soon as she saw what it was, not wanting to hold it even a second longer. The four smiling faces beaming at her fluttered into the battered box. Her father, her brother, Anders, herself, and the Egg Donor. Sanna wouldn&#x2019;t even shorten it to the friendlier acronym, TED.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d often seen the box tucked under her dad&#x2019;s bed, but she&#x2019;d never been curious about the contents. Her dad had always respected her privacy and given her space, so she had always offered him the same courtesy. At that moment, though, destructive urges boiled inside her&#x2014;shoving all else to the side. Merely throwing away the box of photos wasn&#x2019;t permanent enough. It deserved a more dramatic demise. She wanted to drive it to Gills Rock and toss it into the Death&#x2019;s Door waters, where it could live with all the other shipwrecks. That&#x2019;s where that box belonged.<br> <br>Rational thought prevailed&#x2014;she didn&#x2019;t snatch the box and run away to destroy it&#x2014;but it did little to calm her roiling emotions. She gently lifted the box, but her careful movements caused her dad to twitch awake, his hands pulling the box back to his lap.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got it,&#x201d; he said, the words still mushy with sleep.<br> <br>Sanna straightened and watched as her dad fumbled to cover the box and pull it close to his plaid-coated chest.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why are you wasting time with that, Dad? There&#x2019;s nothing worth remembering in there.&#x201d;<br> <br>He blinked away the sleep still muffling his senses and covered the box protectively with his arms. Einars smiled that annoying grin of elders who know better.<br> <br>&#x201c;Happiness is always worth remembering, even when it was temporary.&#x201d;<br> <br>� � � � �<br> <br>Back in her happy place, the barn, Sanna snapped one of the sticks she&#x2019;d grabbed from the fridge and searched for any sign of green inside. Nothing&#x2014;only dry, dead wood. She tossed the branch onto her cluttered stainless steel workbench already strewn with beakers, plastic tubing, her journal&#x2014;tools of her woefully unsuccessful cider-making business. And now, she failed again to graft her beloved heirloom apple trees onto newer stock.<br> <br>After waking her dad, she&#x2019;d returned to the safety of her barn, but the pain welling inside her wouldn&#x2019;t go back down. The barn, complete with the fresh sawdust scent of new construction, was built into a small hill across a gravel-covered parking area from their house. The bottom level was used as the farm stand during the fall and a garage during the winter, while her workspace and cidery comprised the second level. She could get to the bottom story two ways: by taking the spiral stairs in the corner or by exiting the garage door on the opposite wall and walking around the building and down the hill. She&#x2019;d bounded up the spiral steps two at a time just now, her long legs and resentment carrying her even more briskly than usual. She hadn&#x2019;t been prepared to see the Donor&#x2019;s smiling face, though she knew enough to know preparation wouldn&#x2019;t have helped. Her day had been perfectly scheduled and productive, everything as expected. Awake at six, breakfast by six thirty, in the trees by seven with a thermos of black tea and a packed lunch, then to the cidery after lunch for an afternoon of quiet, peaceful work. That&#x2019;s where she&#x2019;d been before she found her dad, in the content corner of her mind full of trees and flavors&#x2014;when she was ripped out of it like a fish flopping on a hook.<br> <br>At thirty-two, she knew she should be over the betrayal. And she wanted to forget about the Donor, but, even after all these years, she could never forgive her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t keep?&#x201d; her dad said, and pointed to where she had flung the branch. He stood in the doorway of her second-story workspace, his lanky frame outlined by the warm June sunlight behind him. Einars wore his usual work jeans and a lightweight long-sleeve work shirt over a tee. The vitality that had been notably absent during his nap vibrated off him now.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Not the ones I had in the house, or the ones I stored out here. All dead wood.&#x201d; She had hoped to graft these twigs onto the root stock she&#x2019;d been saving, to see if she could foster new trees from the heirloom stock in the back of the orchard. &#x201c;I was able to graft the Honeycrisps and Galas with sticks I harvested the same day. I don&#x2019;t know what else to try.&#x201d;<br> <br>She threw the twig and a Ziploc full of dead sticks into the large garbage can, then leaned against the counter to face her dad. Her large workbench spanned an entire wall in the mostly empty main room of the orchard&#x2019;s barn. Later in the season, she&#x2019;d share the space with giant crates of apples for the visiting tourists shopping their farm stand on the lower level. This early in the season, though, the wooden crates were empty, leaving space for her towers of waiting carboys&#x2014;the five-gallon glass jugs she used to make her hard cider. Adjacent to her workbench was a refrigerated room and walk-in freezer, where she stored the juice she had pressed during the previous season in neatly labeled freezer bags and five-gallon buckets. Still waiting along one of the walls was the much larger press and new tanks her father had purchased this year, silent judges of her failure. She&#x2019;d been trying for two years to sell her small-batch hard cider, but only a few locals seemed interested. Instead, the cooler overflowed with her finished products, carefully sorted according to batch.<br> <br>Einars plucked the broken twig out of the garbage with long, thin fingers speckled from sun and age. He&#x2019;d be seventy soon, but he didn&#x2019;t act like it. He could spray a row of trees, trim branches, and make a delicious apple dessert all before one in the afternoon. They worked hard, but Idun&#x2019;s Orchard thrived under their care&#x2014;perhaps not as well as when the Lund population topped their meager two, but well enough they could support themselves. It was a decent life.<br> <br>&#x201c;You kept it hydrated? But not too wet?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>Sanna stared back.<br> <br>&#x201c;I take that as a yes.&#x201d; Einars let the twig drop. &#x201c;Maybe we need some fresh blood around here. You can&#x2019;t expect the trees to give their best for just the two of us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Pa, we don&#x2019;t need more people complicating our system. If it&#x2019;s not broken and all that. Besides, the trees don&#x2019;t know any better.&#x201d;<br> <br>Einars looked out the window behind the workbench at the orchard below them.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d be surprised. They say plants respond to singing and the moods of their owners, why not trees?&#x201d;<br> <br>Sanna returned her grafting tools to their proper places and pulled out beakers and measuring cups.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not singing to the trees.&#x201d;<br> <br>Einars stretched his fingers a few times, like a pianist before a solo.<br> <br>&#x201c;I need to get the spraying done in the Earlies. Can you run to Shopko to pick up some toilet paper and ibuprofen&#x2014;just get the store brand.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sanna played with her necklace, a flat wooden circle strung on a silver chain, the wood worn smooth from years of twisting it with her fingers. Her mind sought the solitary peace of work to pacify the shock and failure of the day.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t today, Pa.&#x201d; She opened her journal to where she had left off. Maybe creating something new would ease the disappointment in her chest. &#x201c;I need to blend a new cider. I&#x2019;ll see you at dinner.&#x201d;<br> <br>She disappeared into the walk-in cooler to get the juices she would need. When she emerged, her dad still stood next to her bench, now with the bag of sticks in his hands, pulling each one out and inspecting it.<br> <br>&#x201c;What if we clipped fresh twigs and did the grafting now?&#x201d; he asked, then dropped the sticks back in the bin.<br> <br>&#x201c;I tried that last year, and they didn&#x2019;t take. That&#x2019;s why I used clippings that had a full season of growth in them. I thought they might be more robust.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sanna set the frozen juice blocks on the counter, already considering her dad&#x2019;s proposition.<br> <br>&#x201c;How did you graft them?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whip graft.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s try the cleft graft on the understock you have, and a few side grafts onto some older trees. Maybe the scions want a more mature tree to grow with. What do you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>His idea could work&#x2014;Sanna wanted to try it. She needed to know she could make more of those trees, that they wouldn&#x2019;t die out under her watch after living for over a hundred years.<br> <br>&#x201c;What about the Earlies?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can spray them tomorrow&#x2014;this seems more important.&#x201d;<br> <br>That was good enough for her. She grabbed her grafting tools and led the way out of the barn, determined to be successful. She would discover the secret to grafting these finicky trees.</p><h2>The Cod&#39;s Tale: A Biography of the Fish that Changed the World!</h2><p><b>* &#x201c;Accessible to middle-grade readers...The Cod&#x2019;s Tale&nbsp;considers how the cod fits into human history.

It's an improbably fascinating story, and here, Kurlansky has teamed up with superb illustrator S.D. Schindler to tell it all over again, this time for kids. The life history of the cod--driven by its insatiable hunger--is interwoven with the insatiable hunger of people, from the Vikings onwards. The illustrations are both informative (a cross-section of the Continental Shelf, a map of the Atlantic) and humorous (comical New Englanders dancing for joy at the invention of frozen fish fingers). Along the way, the reader accidentally learns a great deal about the Vikings, the Basques, the American Revolution, the slave trade--and the current danger, once thought impossible, that the cod will be fished to extinction.

In a landmark trial, Billy was acquitted of his crimes by reason of insanity caused by multiple personality disorder - the first such court decision in history. Among the twenty-four are: Philip, a petty criminal; Kevin, who dealt drugs; April, whose only ambition was to kill Billy&#39;s stepfather; Adalana, the shy, affection-starved lesbian who &#39;used&#39; Billy&#39;s body in the rapes that led to his arrest; David, the eight-year-old &#39;keeper of the pain&#39;; and the Teacher, the sum of all Billy&#39;s alter egos fused into one.

Now, only a goddess can tell the truth. Persephone has everything a daughter of Zeus could want--except for freedom. She lives on the green earth with her mother, Demeter, growing up beneath the ever-watchful eyes of the gods and goddesses on Mount Olympus. But when Persephone meets the enigmatic Hades, she experiences something new: choice. Zeus calls Hades &#34;lord&#34; of the dead as a joke. In truth, Hades is the goddess of the underworld, and no friend of Zeus. She offers Persephone sanctuary in her land of the dead, so the young goddess may escape her Olympian destiny. But Persephone finds more than freedom in the underworld. She finds love, and herself. The Dark Wife is a YA novel, a lesbian revisionist retelling of the Persephone and Hades myth.

Now they've synthesized their vast experience in an essential blueprint to instilling children with a sense of ownership, responsibility, and self-sufficiency. At the heart of their plan is the "Family Economy" complete with a family bank, checkbooks for kids, and a system of initiative-building responsibilities that teaches kids to earn money for the things they want. The motivation carries over to ownership of their own decisions, values, and goals. Anecdotal, time-tested, and gently humorous, <i>The Entitlement Trap</i> challenges some of the sacred cows of parenting and replaces them with values that will save kids (and their parents) from a lifetime of dependence and disabling debt.</p></p><p>In addition to being renowned authors and parenting experts, <b>Richard</b> and <b>Linda Eyre</b> are also the parents of nine children-or as they say, "one of every kind"-and live in Park city, Utah."Linda and Richard Eyre continue to reach out to parents with sage advice on nurturing the family's value system." &#x2014; <b>Dr. Phil</b><br><br>"I've known Richard and Linda Eyre for thirty years...They are very attractive personalities with magnificent messages...They walk their talk and have such practical, realistic ideas to help us in our families, in our life-balance, and in building values deep inside our own lives." &#x2014; <b>Stephen R.

Since then, critics and scholars have largely ignored him. Wyeth, however, who is age 88 at the date of publication, has continued to paint, to the delight of his admirers, collectors, and the art-loving public. Now, in association with the High Museum exhibition, Andrew Wyeth: Memory &amp; Magic takes a fresh look at the work of one of America's most beloved artists.In examining his entire oeuvre, the book celebrates the artist's ongoing love affair with everyday life-domestic, natural, and architectural. Found throughout Wyeth's work, these objects form patterns that illuminate core themes and reveal the artist wrestling with issues of memory, temporality, embodiment, and the metaphysical. Organized chronologically and thematically, the book explores how the artist's approach to these subjects was formed in his early career, and has been revisited in new and surprising ways in recent years.Andrew Wyeth: Memory &amp; Magic comprises 150 tempera paintings and 50 drawings and watercolors-including his most-famous works, but also many published here for the first time.</p><p>Anne Knutson is guest curator for the exhibition Andrew Wyeth: Memory &amp; Magic. Kathleen A. Foster is the Robert L. McNeill, Jr. Curator of American Art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.Michael R. Taylor is Associate Curator and Acting Head of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Christopher Crosman is Director of the William A. Farnsworth Library and Art Museum in Rockland, Maine.John Wilmerding is the Christopher B. Sarofim Professor of American Art at Princeton University.<i>Starred Review.</i> In this post-post-modern era&#x2014;when no single artistic movement can pretend to claim dominance, and the "shock of the new" has pretty much worn off&#x2014;the American realist tradition is starting to look better and better, and no living artist encapsulates that tradition more definitively than Andrew Wyeth. With the overhyped (<i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i> covers!) late '70s controversy over the Helga paintings pretty much forgotten, now is a good time for the kind of serious reassessment facilitated by this lavish retrospective. Its different essays&#x2014;of uniformly high quality&#x2014;emphasize various aspects of Wyeth's oeuvre. Taylor explores the early work's surprising connections to surrealism, for example, while Knutson's movingly personal essay investigates the artist's lesser-known depictions of everyday objects, and Crosman outlines the pivotal role of the artist's wife, Betsy. Together, the essays place Wyeth within a number of overlapping contexts while honoring the singular path that this American master walks. (Entering his 90s, Wyeth is still very much a going concern and the book reproduces a number of his recent paintings.) The illustrations, which include works by artists who have influenced Wyeth, advance these arguments while making for a gorgeous book. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Spending months in relative isolation, the musician refashioned himself, publicly vowing to never again play rock and roll. Reed wrote verse and contributed his work to journals and small press publications. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a poet,&#x201d; he proclaimed from the stage of St. Mark&#x2019;s Church in March 1971.

Discover the history and religion of the Vikings, including Norse mythology, seasonal festivals, and magical techniques.</p> <p>If you are interested in practicing Norse Wicca, you'll learn about the three-fold goddess and the god, as well as how to celebrate the holidays, all from the perspective of Norse Paganism. Discover the secrets of herb magic, cauldron magic, cord magic, elf magic, dwarf magic, and more. These magical techniques are presented in a clear, step-by-step format.</p> <p>The practice of Norse magic enlists the help of the Asa-Gods, Light Elves and good Dwarves. It elicits aid from dead ancestors and the rulers of the Elements. It is an active magic, reserved for participants, not bystanders. In order to work the magic of this system you must attune yourself to the powers of the Elements, calling upon the Asa-Gods and other supernatural beings. <em>Norse Magic</em> includes complete instructions, exercises, and rituals for this technique.</p> <p>The Norse Pagans were one of the last European societies to convert to Christianity, but their Pagan mythology and magic survived and continues to thrive. <em>Norse Magic</em> is your key to the study and practice of this powerful and ancient spiritual system.</p></p><p>Many people are familiar with Greek and Roman mythology. But even though the Norse people remained pagans for centuries after most of Europe had converted to Christianity, very little is generally known of their mythology. <br> <br>That is one of the reasons I'm glad Llewellyn has published D. J. Conway's Norse Magic. Even if you're not interested in following the path of Norse Paganism, this book helps to correct the lack of information that has been available. Here you will find page after page of the history, mythology, lore and rituals of the Norse. For example, you will find a comprehensive list of over 150 Norse gods, goddesses, supernatural beings, places and things, including a guide to the correct pronunciation of each term. <br> <br>If you are interested in following the path of Norse Paganism, this book can become your most important resource.

You will also learn about the gods and goddesses from the Norse point of view. <br> <br>And then there's the magic! You will learn how to cast the magic circle and what magical tools you need. You will learn a wide variety of magics, including herb magic, elf magic, cord magic, and cauldron magic. You'll also discover the secrets of the Norse runes and how to use them for divination. <br> <br>It is time to make the spiritual history of all cultures easily available for anyone who is interested in learning about them. This book is perfect for anyone who is eager to learn more about the powerful magic and mythology of Norse spirituality. <br> <br><p>A native of the Pacific Northwest, <strong>D.J. Conway</strong> (1939 - 2019) studied the occult fields for over 35 years. Her quest for knowledge covered Paganism, Wicca, New Age, and Eastern philosophies as well as history, the magical arts, mythology, and folklore. Conway wrote more than 20 nonfiction books, including <em>Celtic Magic</em> (Llewellyn), <em>Dancing with Dragons</em> (Llewellyn), <em>Mystical Dragon Magic</em> (Llewellyn), <em>The Ancient Art of Faery Magick</em> (10 Speed Press), and <em>The Little Book of Candle Magic</em> (10 Speed Press).</p></p><h2>Secret Map of the Body: Visions of the Human Energy Structure</h2><p><p>Yang�npa&#x2019;s <em>Hidden Description of the Vajra Body</em> presents the triad constituting the Vajra Body &#x2013; the channels, energy-winds, and vital essences &#x2013; as the basis for the application of experiential yogic techniques. Buddhism often relegates the body to a role subordinate to that of the mind; the focus of Yang�npa&#x2019;s Hidden Description is the body itself, with its manifold layers &#x2013; coarse, subtle, and very subtle.<br> In his presentation of the human body&#x2019;s energetic structure he contends that it is not simply the means to achieve enlightenment, but enlightenment itself, blending the Highest Tantra notion of the body as the method with the Total Perfection (rdzogs chen) principle of inherently present enlightenment as the fundamental nature of all phenomena.</p> <p><br> <strong>Gyalwa Yang�npa</strong> realized the nature of mind at the age of eight upon hearing instructions on the Dzogchen mind cycle of teachings. And at age nine he was installed as the abbot of Lhadong monastery, where he gave profound religious discourses, establishing his reputation as an enlightened emanation.<br> During his lifetime, 1213-1258, he was devoted to four precious masters of different lineages. Under the guidance of the first two, he undertook solitary retreat and, following a clear vision of the energetic system of body and mind,came to master this inseparable matrix.<br> An exceptional being gifted with powers, knowledge, and wisdom, Yang�npa led an exemplary life and his spiritual achievements won him a large number of followers.

Join the Random House Reader&#x2019;s Circle for author chats and more.</b></p><p><p><b>Inspiration for <i>The Life List</i>, by Lori Nelson Spielman</b></p> <p>Like any author, I&#x2019;m often asked how I came up with the idea for my novel. My answer comes easily. The seed for <i>The Life List</i> was found in an old cedar box. </p> <p>It had been years since I&#x2019;d last opened my miniature hope chest, a high school graduation gift. The scent of cedar greeted me, along with my first bankbook, my grandmother&#x2019;s rosary, a couple of silver dollars, and a single sheet of notebook paper, folded into a neat little square. </p> <p>Curious, I unfolded the yellowed paper. In flowery cursive, <i>Lori&#x2019;s List</i> was penciled across the top. My abandoned life list. </p> <p>I was wise enough to include the day and month, March 13th, but foolishly I&#x2019;d omitted the year. Maybe I hadn&#x2019;t planned to keep it. Maybe I didn&#x2019;t realize how quickly memories fade, how years later, I&#x2019;d barely remember the day that young girl sat on her blue flowered bedspread, contemplating her future. But judging from the goals, what had and hadn&#x2019;t been accomplished, I was somewhere between 12 and 14 years old. </p> <p>The crumpled piece of paper revealed a list of 29 things my adolescent mind imagined would make for a good life. I&#x2019;d also added a sidebar called <i>Ways to Be, </i> which included such pearls as, <i>Don&#x2019;t talk about ANYONE. Laugh. Say &#x201c;hi&#x201d; to everyone. </i> </p> <p>I&#x2019;d love to say that all my goals were altruistic and contemplative. In truth, many were embarrassingly self-indulgent and trivial. <i>Have lots of clothes</i> was actually on my life list. Seriously! <i>Be a cheerleader</i> was another lofty goal. (Did I actually think shaking pompoms would be a life changer?) Ah, but I did have <i>Help people</i> on my list. And <i>Give my body to science</i> was thoughtful, right? Never mind that I qualified it with a <i> &#x201c;maybe&#x201d;. </i></p> <p>Relationships were important to me. A scrawny girl with teeth too big and breasts too small, I was pretty much ignored by the opposite sex. So naturally, <i>Be popular and Have boyfriends</i> were at the top of my list, followed by longer-term goals of <i>Have a good marriage, Have babies, Have a close family. </i></p> <p>Even as a young girl, I loved to write and tell stories, yet being an author was not on my life list. In my middleclass neighborhood, in my middleclass town, I&#x2019;d never met a single author. Authors lived in New York City, or in glass-walled houses overlooking the Pacific. Instead, I hoped to be a teacher, a profession that seemed accessible. And if not glamorous, then at least comfortable. </p> <p>As I stood reading the list some thirty years later, it pleased me that I did, indeed, accomplish many of my goals. I had made the cheerleading squad (phew, right?). I had my share of boyfriends, though they arrived much later than that young girl once hoped, thank God. I&#x2019;d graduated from college and learned to ski and traveled to Europe. I was a teacher, a profession I loved. I had a good marriage. I even had a cat. But I didn&#x2019;t live on a lake. I hadn&#x2019;t designed my own home. I didn&#x2019;t have two kids, or a horse, or a dog. </p> <p>As I read the list, I thought about how different my life would be if I&#x2019;d fulfilled every goal my youthful heart longed for. In no time, my mind was racing. A story was taking shape. What if someone were forced to finish their life list&#x2014;a list they thought they&#x2019;d outgrown? </p> <p>In the course of several days, my story evolved. First, I came up with riddles from a dying mother, offering her daughter cryptic clues to find her true self. But that was silly. Why the riddles? Why wouldn&#x2019;t her mother just tell her daughter what she wanted her to accomplish? And it was crucial that the mother didn&#x2019;t appear heavy-handed or controlling. The story could only work if it was clear that the mother&#x2019;s intentions came from a loving heart. I also knew the story risked being predictable. I imagined readers rolling their eyes, sure that in the end, Brett would be married to the love of her life and have a baby and a dog and a horse. Her dreams couldn&#x2019;t be accomplished easily, or in conventional ways the reader might expect. I wanted some goals to lead to others, in circuitous, serendipitous ways. Soon, pages for <i>Another Sky</i> were piling up, becoming the manuscript that would later be re-titled, <i>The Life List. </i></p> <p>So there you have it: the kernel for <i>The Life List</i> was my old life list&#x2014;Lori&#x2019;s List. Though I fell short of some goals, I believe my list served me well. It&#x2019;s true, I won&#x2019;t be waving my children off to college. But I will get to watch my novel set off for parts of the world I may never visit. My book will be introduced to new people, and hopefully entertain, and possibly provoke discussion. And maybe, just maybe, my story will inspire some other little girl, in some other small town, to set her own goals, to aspire to something that&#x2019;s hers alone. And whether her ambitions are humble or grandiose, silly or pensive, it doesn&#x2019;t matter. The important thing is, she dreams. </p><b>Lori Nelson Spielman</b>, a former speech pathologist and guidance counselor, currently works as a homebound teacher for inner-city students.

It was Jones, the inventor of Nautilus exercise equipment, who first discovered that short, intense workouts could produce better results than the long, high-volume workouts then in vogue. <br><br>Even though research into Jones's methods has proved them correct, a number of high-profile strength coaches use HIT to train their athletes, and the bodybuilding magazine Ironman does HIT-based features every issue, there still are no major HIT books in stores. This new book-by champion bodybuilder, exercise researcher, and best-selling author Ellington Darden, who is a Jones disciple and friend-shows lifters how to apply the master's teachings, along with some new HIT concepts to achieve extraordinary results.<br><br>At the heart of the book is a complete, illustrated, six-month course for explosive growth. Exercise by exercise, workout by workout, the reader is shown precisely what to do, and perhaps even more important, what not to do. Charging that too many bodybuilders follow a more-is-better approach-too many exercises, too many sets, and too much frequency-and rely on steroids to compensate for depleted recovery ability, Darden shows why HIT, steroid-free and healthy, is the best way to safely build muscle. Finally, the exercise religion Arthur Jones founded, and Darden fine-tuned, has its bible.</p><p><b>Ellington Darden, Ph.D.</b>, is the leading disciple of the HIT training methods of Arthur Jones, the inventor of Nautilus exercise equipment. Darden, for 17 years the director of research for Nautilus Sports/Medical Industries, is the author of such enormously popular books on high-intensity workouts as <i>The Nautilus Book, High-Intensity Bodybuilding, </i>and <i>100 High-Intensity Ways to Build Your Body</i>, along with 40 other fitness books.

Depopulated after the extermination of its original native population, today it&#x2019;s home to nineteen million.

Almost every county in Florida bears the name of a butcher, a slavedriver, a madman, a scoundrel or a thief, in a state where for half a millennium the governing mandate seems to be Defeat the Truth, Triumph over Reality. T.D. Allman's counter-narrative to all the pretty lies is a scouring hurricane of research, investigation, and soul-cleansing wrath, and I doubt there has ever been a better, or more important, book written about the Sunshine State, the birthplace of imperial hubris, American-style." Bob Shacochis, author of <i>The Immaculate Invasion</i> and <i>The Woman Who Lost Her Soul</i><br><br>"Equal parts social analysis, historical review, and jeremiad, <i>Finding Florida</i> is a passionate, often scathing, and remarkably comprehensive encounter with a confounding, contradictory, and ever-elusive place. If your idea of hell is being chained to a galley oar between a politician and a Chamber of Commerce exec, then you are likely to love this book." Les Standiford, author of <i>Last Train to Paradise</i><br><br> Manuscripts repeatedly find their way into print that ignore the reality of Florida&#x2019;s past and, in so doing, skew our understanding of what Florida has been, what it is now, what it&#x2019;s likely to become, and what that means for everyone. T. D. Allman&#x2019;s book turns all that on its head. It directly challenges the existing historiography with highly intelligent insight and crafting of narrative in a way that permits the reader to immerse himself in a world far from the expected one. <i>Finding Florida</i> is provocative to the point of daring.

While Allman covers an enormous amount of material taking Florida from uninhabited swampland to the sidewalk culture of South Beach he does so in such engaging ways that the reader is never overwhelmed. Indeed, each chapter is in itself a satisfying and illuminating narrative, stock full of vivid characters. Somehow he has managed to pull together a compelling read without sacrificing historical substance, a feat to which many professional historians aspire. His wry voice conveys a point of view that gently pushes readers to understand Florida as an American synecdoche.&#x201d; Glenda Gilmore, Peter V. and C.

The three men were rescued against daunting odds, and then all but forgotten. Yet they laid bare the pathological mistrust that fueled the arms race for the next 30 years.<br><br>Weaving the three strands of this story together for the first time, Giles Whittell masterfully portrays the intense political tensions and nuclear brinkmanship that brought the United States and Soviet Union so close to a hot war in the early 1960s. He reveals the dramatic lives of men drawn into the nadir of the Cold War by duty and curiosity, and the tragicomedy of errors that eventually induced Nikita Khrushchev to send missiles to Fidel Castro.<br><br>Drawing on new interviews conducted in the United States, Europe and Russia with key players in the exchange and the events leading to it, among them Frederic Pryor himself and the man who shot down Gary Powers, <i>Bridge of Spies </i>captures a time when the fate of the world really did depend on coded messages on microdots and brave young men in pressure suits. The exchange that frigid day at two of the most sensitive points along the Iron Curtain represented the first step back from where the superpowers had stood since the building of the Berlin Wall the previous summer--on the brink of World War III.</p><p><b>Giles Whittell </b>is a writer for the <i>Times of London</i>.

It was invented for Joseph Stalin, and it worked pretty well.<br>&nbsp;<br>On July 24, 1946, as most of Russia slept, a team of U.S. Navy frogmen guided a heavy steel container to its final resting place in the clear waters of Bikini Lagoon, 2,500 miles west of Honolulu. They stabilized it with cables ninety feet below an anchored amphibious assault ship that gloried in the name <i>LSM-60. </i>The container was made from the conning tower of the USS <i>Salmon, </i>a scrapped navy submarine, and inside it was a working replica of the plutonium bomb that had killed eighty thousand people at Nagasaki the previous year. That evening, on a support vessel outside the lagoon, the frogmen ate T-bone steaks with all the trimmings.<br>&nbsp;<br>Around the <i>LSM-60, </i>like giant moon shadows on the water&#x2019;s calm surface, a target fleet of eighty-five more ships spent that night emptied of crew and supplies, with no role left except to sink. One of the closest to the bomb was the USS <i>Arkansas, </i>a 27,000-ton battleship that had carried President Taft to Panama before the First World War and bombarded Cherbourg and Iwo Jima in the Second. For most of her life the only way for a battleship to go down had been with guns blazing, but the nuclear age had changed that. It turned out that with the help of an atom bomb a battleship could go down like a toy in a bath. It could be flicked onto its bow and rammed into the seabed so that its superstructure fell off as if never even bolted on.<br>&nbsp;<br>Shortly after breakfast time on the morning of the twenty-fifth, the <i>Arkansas </i>was photographed from every angle as the bomb in the steel container was detonated 170 yards from her hull. Cameras in a B-29 bomber twenty-five thousand feet above the lagoon and a little to the south captured the sight of a huge disc of ocean turning white in an instant. That was the water beneath the <i>Arkansas </i>being vaporized.<br>&nbsp;<br>The shockwave from the initial blast rolled the ship onto her side and ripped off her propellers. A six-thousand-foot column of spray and water, created in about two and a half seconds, then heaved her into a vertical position in which two thirds of her length were clearly visible ten miles away, dwarfed by the largest man-made waterspout in history. She has lain upside down on the floor of the lagoon ever since.<br>&nbsp;<br>The <i>Arkansas </i>was one of ten ships sunk outright by what came to be known as the Baker shot. It was the second of two nuclear tests conducted at Bikini with undisguised panache as the world adjusted to an awesome new technology (and to the daring swimsuit it inspired; the first-ever bikini, presented in Paris that month, was called <i>l&#x2019;atome, </i>and the second was a buttock-baring thong described by one fashion writer as what the survivor of a nuclear blast could expect to be wearing as the fireball subsided).<br>&nbsp;<br>Participation in the tests by U.S. military personnel was voluntary but popular. In shirtsleeves and sunglasses, 37,000 men extended their wartime service for a year to help set up the tests and to see for themselves the power of the weapon that had brought Japan to its knees.<br>&nbsp;<br>Pat Bradley was there, up a tree with a movie camera on Bikini atoll to film the blast and the tsunami it produced&#x2014;a single ninety-foot wave that subsided before it hit the island, then three smaller waves. &#x201c;It took a couple of minutes before the first wave came in to the atoll,&#x201d; he remembered. &#x201c;The second came in higher, then the third completely covered the island four to six feet deep.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>A lean and thoughtful young air force captain named Stan Beerli was there too. He had survived the world war in B-17 bombers over Italy and would survive the cold war in the regulation dark suit of the CIA. His tasks would include trying to keep Gary Powers and the U-2 in the shadows where they belonged, but for the time being the cold war was pure spectacle.<br>&nbsp;<br>The foreign and domestic press were welcome at Bikini. The Baker shot was witnessed by 131 reporters, including a full Soviet contingent. With Warner Bros.&#x2019; help, the Pentagon released a propaganda film of the blast for anyone who had missed the initial coverage, and Admiral William &#x201c;Spike&#x201d; Blandy, who oversaw the operation, posed with his wife cutting an angel food cake in the shape of a mushroom cloud.<br>&nbsp;<br>Responding to public anxiety before the blast, Blandy promised that he was &#x201c;not an atomic playboy&#x201d; and that the bomb would not &#x201c;blow out the bottom of the sea and let all the water run down the hole.&#x201d; This was true, but it could still do a lot of damage. In the summer of 1947 <i>Life </i>magazine published a long article based on official studies of the intense radioactive fallout from the Baker bomb. It concluded that if a similar weapon were to explode off the tip of Manhattan in a stiff southerly wind, two million people would die.<br>&nbsp;<br>America had finished the war with a pair of atom bombs and started the peace in the same way. President Truman&#x2019;s message to Stalin could not have been clearer if written in blood. It was a warning not to contemplate starting a new war in Europe trusting in the Red Army&#x2019;s old-fashioned strength in numbers. And it signaled more concisely than any speech that Truman had accepted the central argument of George Kennan&#x2019;s famous &#x201c;Long Telegram,&#x201d; sent from the U.S. embassy in Moscow six months before the tests: the Soviet Union had to be contained. As Truman himself put it: &#x201c;If we could just have Stalin and his boys see one of these things, there wouldn&#x2019;t be any question about another war.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Stalin refused to be intimidated. He had not sacrificed twenty million people to defeat Fascism only to be told where to set the limits on Stalinism. And yet he had a problem.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the time of the Bikini tests, the Soviet Union was still three years and a month from exploding its first nuclear weapon. Its efforts to build one were under way on a bend in the Shagan River in eastern Kazakhstan, under the direction of a bearded young hero of Soviet science (and tightly closeted homosexual) named Igor Kurchatov. Stalin had deemed the bomb &#x201c;Problem Number One.&#x201d; He had created a special state committee to ensure that no expense was spared in solving it. Whole mountains in Bulgaria had been commandeered to give Kurchatov the uranium he needed. But Kurchatov was not an innovator. He was a nuclear plagiarist, almost completely dependent on intelligence from left-leaning scientists in the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos. As he admitted in a 1943 memo to the Council of People&#x2019;s Commissars, this flow of intelligence had &#x201c;immense, indeed incalculable importance for our State and science&#x201d;&#x2014;but in 1946 the flow had slowed suddenly to a trickle.<br>&nbsp;<br>Just a year earlier, not one but two descriptions of the first bomb tested at Los Alamos were in the Kremlin nearly two weeks before it even exploded. After that test, more detailed diagrams of the device reached Moscow than were provided in the first official nuclear report to Congress. One was smuggled out of Albuquerque in a box of Kleenex. Atomic espionage was never more bountiful than this. But on November 7, 1945, Elizabeth Terrill Bentley, a thirty-seven-year-old graduate of Vassar and a paid-up Soviet agent, went to the FBI with a 107-page description of Soviet intelligence activities in North America. The following day J. Edgar Hoover sent a secret memo to the White House based on Bentley&#x2019;s material. It produced few arrests because she offered scant supporting evidence, but her defection forced Moscow to shut down most of the channels feeding nuclear secrets to Kurchatov.<br>&nbsp;<br>There were other reasons why Soviet espionage in the United States was grinding to a halt. Victory in the war had removed the most compelling reason for scientists at Los Alamos to share designs with their former Soviet allies&#x2014;the defeat of Nazism. And the U.S. Army had at last begun decoding encrypted Soviet cable traffic, code-named Venona, that corroborated many of Bentley&#x2019;s allegations.<br>&nbsp;<br>Without vital intelligence from the true pioneers of nuclear fission in New Mexico, Kurchatov would not be able to complete the bomb. Without the bomb, the most that the Soviet empire could hope to do was defend its interminable frontiers. As the Bikini lagoon erupted, the outlook for international Communism looked bleak indeed. Yet from the bowels of the Lyubianka&#x2014;headquarters of the KGB and the true engine room of the revolution&#x2014;there came a glimmer of hope.</p><h2>Visible Learners: Promoting Reggio-Inspired Approaches in All Schools</h2><p><b>A progressive, research-based approach for making learning visible</b> <p>Based on the Reggio Emilia approach to learning, <i>Visible Learners</i> highlights learning through interpreting objects and artifacts, group learning, and documentation to make students' learning evident to teachers. Visible classrooms are committed to five key principles: that learning is purposeful, social, emotional, empowering, and representational.

In this approach, first developed during a long-term collaboration between researchers at Harvard's Project Zero and Reggio educators, learning becomes a visible activity that develops students' intellectual capacities as well as their individual and group identities as learners.</p> <p>Visible classrooms can be identified by five key principles&#x2015;that learning is purposeful, social, representational, empowering, and emotional. The authors define each principle using illustrative learning portraits, quotes from students and teachers, pictures, reflections, and examples of student work. Additionally, the authors offer teachers and administrators practical ways to enhance learning by increasing collaboration and critical thinking across grade levels and subject matter. Also included is a section containing dozens of tools for making learners and learning visible, incorporating guidelines for the classroom and the staffroom as well as ideas for engaging students' families.</p> <p><i>Visible Learners</i> shows how observing and documenting learning can change the nature of that learning, and asks teachers to look beyond surface to understand who their students are, what they come to know, and how they come to know it.</p> <p>" We are at a critical moment that cries out for 4 C's learning (critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity). <i>Visible Learning</i> addresses this very challenge by offering rich examples and practical guidance for creating powerful learning experiences in our classrooms, schools, and communities." &#x2015;<b>Ken Kay</b>, CEO of EdLeader21 and cofounder and president, Partnership for 21st Century Skills</p> <p>" Many educators have pondered whether the 'Reggio approach' can be employed with older children and under different conditions.

Calle's projects have frequently drawn on episodes from her own life, but this book&#x2015;part visual memoir, part meditation on the resonances of photographs and belongings&#x2015;is as close as she has come to producing an autobiography, albeit one highly poetical and fragmentary, as is characteristic of her work.

Each is accompanied by an image; each offers a fragment of life.</p><p>The slim, portable volume is divided into sections: the first is composed of various reflections on objects such as a shoe, a postcard or "the breasts"; the second, "The Husband," of recollections of episodes from Calle's first marriage; and the third gathers a variety of autobiographical recollections. Calle herself is the author, narrator and protagonist of her stories and photography; her words are somber, chosen precisely and carefully.

And yet, as the modern reader is confronted with his words, it becomes apparent that he too is being addressed; Chrysostom's words are words proclaiming the truth of the Gospel to all people of all times.

One of its greatest strengths, perhaps the greatest, is that the author makes clear that none of the persons concerned, Hellenic, Jewish or Christian, was engaged in the pursuit of a philosophical abstraction, or the heaping of rhetorical superlatives on God. They were rather concerned to present the origin of the universe as an intimately present living reality which infinitely transcends our thought and speech. This, combined with careful attention to the varieties of negative theology and its relations with positive, and the particular difficulties experienced by the members of the various traditions involved, makes the book the best introduction to the negative theology available.&#34;&#34; -A.

I wish merely to explain the history of my Project, the scope and plan of this work, and the objects I have held in view. </p><p>In separate introductory Notes I have mentioned the useful books to which I have referred, under the headings: Commentaries on the Qur'an; Translations of the Qur'an; and Useful Works of Reference. I have similarly explained the system, which I have followed in the Transliteration of Arabic Words and Names; the Abbreviations I have used; and the Principal Divisions of the Qur'an. </p><p>It may be asked: Is there any need for a fresh English Translation? To those who ask this question I commend a careful consideration of the facts, which I have set out in my note on Translations of the Qur'an. After they have read it, I would invite them to take any particular passage say 2:74, or 2:102, or 2:164 and compare it with any previous version they choose. If they find that I have helped them even the least bit further in understanding its meaning, or appreciating its beauty, or catching something of the grandeur of the original, I would claim that my humble attempt is justified. </p><p>It is the duty of every Muslim-man, woman, or child-to read the Qur'an and understand it according to his own capacity. If anyone of us attains to some knowledge or understanding of it by study, contemplation, and the test of life, both outward and inward, it is his duty, according to his capacity, to instruct others, and share with them the joy and peace which result from contact with the spiritual world. The Qur'an-indeed every religious book-has to be read, not only with the tongue and voice and eyes, but with the best light that our intellect can supply, and even more, with the truest and purest light which our heart and conscience can give us. It is in this spirit that I would have my readers approach the Qur'an. </p><p>It was between the ages of four and five that I first learned to read its Arabic words, to revel in its rhythm and music, and wonder at its meaning. I have a dim recollection of the khatm ceremony which closed that stage. It was called "completion": it really just began a spiritual awakening that has gone on ever since. My revered father taught me Arabic, but I must have imbibed from him into my innermost being something more, something which told me that all the world's thoughts, all the world's most beautiful languages and literatures, are but vehicles for that ineffable message which comes to the heart in rare moments of ecstasy. The soul of mysticism and ecstasy is in the Qur'an, as well as the plain guidance for the plain man, which a world in a hurry affects to consider as sufficient. It is good to make this personal confession, to an age in which it is in the highest degree unfashionable to speak of religion or spiritual peace or consolation, an age in which words like these draw forth only derision, pity, or contempt. </p><p>I have explored Western lands, Western manners, and the depths of Western thought and Western learning, to an extent, which has rarely fallen to the lot of an Eastern mortal. But I have never lost touch with my Eastern heritage. Through all my successes and failures, I have learned to rely more and more upon the one true thing in all life-the voice that speaks in a tongue above that of mortal man. For me the embodiment of that voice has been in the noble words of the Arabic Qur'an, which I have tried to translate for myself and apply to my experience repeatedly. The service of the Qur'an has been the pride and the privilege of many Muslims. I felt that with such life-experience as has fallen to my lot, my service to the Qur'an should be to present it in a fitting garb in English. That ambition I have cherished in my mind for more than forty years. I have collected books and materials for it. I have visited places, undertaken journeys, taken notes, sought the society of men, and tried to explore their thoughts and hearts, in order to equip myself for the task. Sometimes I have considered it too stupendous for me-the double task of understanding the original, and reproducing its nobility, its beauty, its poetry, its grandeur, and its sweet practical reasonable application to everyday experience. Then I have blamed myself for lack of courage-the spiritual courage of men who dared all in the Cause, which was so dear to them. </p><p>Two sets of apparently accidental circumstances at last decided me. A man's life is subject to inner storms far more devastating than those in the physical world around him. In such a storm, in the bitter anguish of a personal sorrow which nearly unseated my reason and made life seem meaningless, a new hope was born out of a systematic pursuit of my long-cherished project. Watered by tears, my manuscript began to grow in depth and earnestness if not in bulk. I guarded it like a secret treasure. Wanderer that l am, I carried it about, thousands of miles, to all sorts of countries and among all sorts of people. At length, in the city of Lahore, I happened to mention the matter to some young people who held me in respect and affection. They showed an enthusiasm and an eagerness which surprised me. They almost took the matter out of my hands. They asked for immediate publication. I had various bits ready, but not even one complete Siparah (Juz&#x2019; (1/30 of the Qur&#x2019;an) )*. They made me promise to complete at least one Siparah* before I left Lahore. As if by magic, a publisher, a katib (calligraphist to write the Arabic Text), an engraver of blocks for such text, a printer were found, all equally anxious to push forward the scheme. Blessed be youth, for its energy and determination. "Where others flinch, rash youth will dare!"</p>Gentle and discerning reader! what I wish to present to you is an English Interpretation, side by side with the Arabic Text. The English shall be, not a mere substitution of one word for another, but the best expression I can give to the fullest meaning which I can understand from the Arabic Text. The rhythm, music, and exalted tone of the original should be reflected in the English Interpretation. It may be but a faint reflection, but such beauty and power as my pen can command shall be brought to its service. I want to make English itself an Islamic language, if such a person as I can do it. And I must give you all the accessory aid which I can. In rhythmic prose, or free verse (whichever you like to call it), I prepare the atmosphere for you in a running Commentary. Introducing the subject generally, I come to the actual Surahs. Where they are short, I give you one or two paragraphs of my rhythmic Commentary to prepare you for the Text. Where the Surah is long, ! <p>I introduce the subject matter in short appropriate paragraphs of the Commentary from time to time, each indicating the particular verses to which it refers. The paragraphs of the running Commentary are numbered consecutively, with some regard to the connection with the preceding and the following paragraphs. It is possible to read this running rhythmic Commentary by itself to get a general bird's-eye view of the contents of the Holy Book before you proceed to the study of the Book itself. </p><p>It is important that at least in lslamic countries one system of numbering should be adopted. I have adopted mainly that of the Egyptian edition published under the authority of the King of Egypt. This will probably be accepted in Egypt and in Arabic-speaking countries, as those countries generally look up to Egypt in matters of literature. I am glad to see that the text shortly to be published by the Anjumani Himayati Islam of Lahore is following the same system of numbering. I recommend to other publishers in India the same good example. If once this is done we shall have a uniform system of numbering. I have retained the numbering of Sections, as it is universally used in the Arabic copies, and marks a logical division of the Surahs. I have supplied a further aid to the reader in indicating subdivision of the Sections into paragraphs. They are not numbered, but are distinguished by the use of a flowery initial letter. </p><p>In translating the Text I have aired no views of my own, but followed the received Commentators. Where they differ among themselves, I have had to choose what appeared to me to be the most reasonable opinion from all points of view. Where it is a question merely of words, I have not considered the question important enough to discuss in the Notes, but where it is a question of substance, I hope adequate explanations will be found in the Notes. Where I have departed from the literal translation in order to express the spirit of the original better in English, I have explained the literal meaning in the Notes. For example, see 2:104 n. and 2:26 n. In choosing an English word for an Arabic word, a translator necessarily exercises his own judgment and may be unconsciously expressing a point of view, but that is inevitable. </p><p>Let me explain the scope of the Notes. I have made them as short as possible consistently with the object I have in view, viz., to give to the English reader, scholar as well as general reader, a fairly complete but concise view of what I understand to be the meaning of the Text. To discuss theological controversies or enter into polemical arguments I have considered outside my scope. Such discussions and arguments may be necessary and valuable, but they should find a place in separate treatises, if only out of respect to the Holy Book. Besides, such discussions leave no room for more important matters on which present-day readers desire information. In this respect, our Commentators have not always been discreet. On questions of law, the Qur'an lays down general principles, and these I have explained. I have avoided technical details: these will be found discussed in their proper place in my book on "Anglo-Muhammadan Law". Nor have I devoted much space to grammatical or philological Notes. On these points, I consider that the labors of the vast body of our learned men in the past have left little new to say now. There is usually not much controversy, and I have accepted their conclusions without setting out the reasons for them. Where it has been necessary for the understanding of the Text to refer to the particular occasion for the revelation of a particular verse, I have done so briefly, but have not allowed it to absorb a disproportionate amount of space. It will be found that every verse revealed for a particular occasion has also a general meaning. The particular occasion and the particular people concerned have passed away, but the general meaning and its application remain true for all time. What we are concerned about now, in the fourteenth century of the Hijrah, is: what guidance can we draw for ourselves from the message of Allah? </p><p>I spoke of the general meaning of the verses. Every earnest and reverent student of the Qur'an, as he proceeds with his study, will find, with an inward joy difficult to describe, how this general meaning also enlarges as his own capacity for understanding increases. It is like a traveler climbing a mountain: the higher he goes, the farther he sees. From a literary point of view, the poet Keats has described his feeling when he discovered Chapman's Homer: </p><p>Then felt I like some watcher of the skies <br>When anew planet swims into his ken, <br>Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes <br>He stared at the Pacific-and all his men <br>Looked at each other with a wild surmise <br>Silent, upon a peak in Darien. </p><p>How much greater is the joy and sense of wonder and miracle when the Qur'an opens our spiritual eyes! The meaning which we thought we had grasped expands. New worlds are opened out. As we progress, still newer, and again newer worlds "swim into our ken". The miracle deepens and deepens, and almost completely absorbs us. And yet we know that the "face of Allah "our final goal-has not yet been reached. We are in the mulk of Sulayman (2:102), which the evil ones denied, belied, and even turned into blasphemy. But we can ignore blasphemy, ridicule and contempt, for we are on the threshold of Realities, and a little perfume from the garden of the Holy One has already gladdened our nostrils. </p><p>Such meaning it is most difficult to express. But where I can, I have indicated it in the Notes, in the Commentary, and with the help of the rhythm and the elevated language of the Text. </p><p>One final word to my readers. Read, study, and digest the Holy Book. Read slowly, and let it sink into your heart and soul. Such study will, like virtue, be its own reward. If you find anything in this volume to criticize, please let it not spoil your enjoyment of the rest. If you write to me, quoting chapter and verse, I shall be glad to consider your criticism, but let it not vex you if I exercise my own judgment in deciding for myself. Any corrections accepted will be gratefully acknowledged. On the other hand, if there is something that specially pleases you or helps you, please do not hesitate to write to me. I have given you other interests to help you. It will be a pleasure to know that my labor has not been in vain. If you address me in care of my Publisher at his Lahore address, he will always forward the letters to me. </p><p>A.

Unfortunately, the effort to redefine government to reflect &#x201c;the changing and growing social order&#x201d; has gone very far toward success. Politicians such as Franklin Roosevelt found ways to condemn and discard the Constitution and to redefine the Declaration to justify government without limit.

John Rebus. He&#39;s prowling the streets in search of something so evil he can almost taste it.</p><p>Born in the Kingdom of Fife in 1960, Ian Rankin graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1982, and then spent three years writing novels when he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish Literature. His first Rebus novel was published in 1987, and the Rebus books are now translated into thirty-six languages and are bestsellers worldwide.Ian Rankin has been elected a Hawthornden Fellow, and is also a past winner of the Chandler-Fulbright Award.

She was at the top of the stairs, and he stumbled towards her, grabbing her by the arms, propelling her downstairs with unfocussed force, so that she feared they would both fall. She cried out. <p></p>&#x2018;Ronnie! Hide from who?&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Hide!&#x2019; he shrieked again. &#x2018;Hide! They&#x2019;re coming! They&#x2019;re coming!&#x2019; <p></p>He had pushed her all the way to the front door now. She&#x2019;d seen him pretty strung out before, but never this bad. A fix would help him, she knew it would. And she knew, too, that he had the makings upstairs in his bedroom. The sweat trickled from his chilled rat&#x2019;s-tails of hair. Only two minutes ago, the most important decision in her life had been whether or not to dare a trip to the squat&#x2019;s seething lavatory. But now&#x2026;. <p></p>&#x2018;They&#x2019;re coming,&#x2019; he repeated, his voice a whisper now. &#x2018;Hide.&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Ronnie,&#x2019; she said, &#x2018;you&#x2019;re scaring me.&#x2019; <p></p>He stared at her, his eyes seeming almost to recognise her. Then he looked away again, into a distance all of his own. The word was a snakelike hiss. <p></p>&#x2018;Hide.&#x2019; And with that he yanked open the door. It was raining outside, and she hesitated. But then fear took her, and she made to cross the threshold. But his hand grabbed at her arm, pulling her back inside. He embraced her, his sweat sea-salty, his body throbbing. His mouth was close to her ear, his breath hot. <p></p>&#x2018;They&#x2019;ve murdered me,&#x2019; he said. Then with sudden ferocity he pushed her again, and this time she was outside, and the door was slamming shut, leaving him alone in the house. Alone with himself. She stood on the garden path, staring at the door, trying to decide whether to knock or not. <p></p>It wouldn&#x2019;t make any difference. She knew that. So instead she started to cry. Her head slipped forward in a rare show of self-pity and she wept for a full minute, before, breathing hard three times, she turned and walked quickly down the garden path (such as it was). Someone would take her in. Someone would comfort her and take away the fear and dry her clothes. <p></p>Someone always did. <p></p>JOHN REBUS stared hard at the dish in front of him, oblivious to the conversation around the table, the background music, the flickering candles. He didn&#x2019;t really care about house prices in Barnton, or the latest delicatessen to be opened in the Grassmarket. He didn&#x2019;t much want to speak to the other guests&#x2014;a female lecturer to his right, a male bookseller to his left&#x2014;about&#x2026; well, what ever they&#x2019;d just been discussing. Yes, it was the perfect dinner party, the conversation as tangy as the starter course, and he was glad Rian had invited him. Of course he was. But the more he stared at the half lobster on his plate, the more an unfocussed despair grew within him. What had he in common with these people? Would they laugh if he told the story of the police alsatian and the severed head? No, they would not. They would smile politely, then bow their heads towards their plates, acknowledging that he was&#x2026; well, <i>different</i> from them. <p></p>&#x2018;Vegetables, John?&#x2019; <p></p>It was Rian&#x2019;s voice, warning him that he was not &#x2018;taking part&#x2019;, was not &#x2018;conversing&#x2019; or even looking interested. He accepted the large oval dish with a smile, but avoided her eyes. <p></p>She was a nice girl. Quite a stunner in an individual sort of way. Bright red hair, cut short and pageboyish. Eyes deep, striking green. Lips thin but promising. Oh yes, he liked her. He wouldn&#x2019;t have accepted her invitation otherwise. He fished about in the dish for a piece of broccoli that wouldn&#x2019;t break into a thousand pieces as he tried to manoeuvre it onto his plate. <p></p>&#x2018;Gorgeous food, Rian,&#x2019; said the bookseller, and Rian smiled, accepting the remark, her face reddening slightly. That was all it took, John. That was all you had to say to make this girl happy. But in his mouth he knew it would come out sounding sarcastic. His tone of voice was not something he could suddenly throw off like a piece of clothing. It was a part of him, nurtured over a course of years. So when the lecturer agreed with the bookseller, all John Rebus did was smile and nod, the smile too fixed, the nod going on a second or two too long, so that they were all looking at him again. The piece of broccoli snapped into two neat halves above his plate and splattered onto the tablecloth. <p></p>&#x2018;Shite!&#x2019; he said, knowing as the word escaped his lips that it was not quite appropriate, not quite the <i>right</i> word for the occasion. Well, what was he, a man or a thesaurus? <p></p>&#x2018;Sorry,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Couldn&#x2019;t be helped,&#x2019; said Rian. My God, her voice was cold. <p></p>It was the perfect end to a perfect weekend. He&#x2019;d gone shopping on Saturday, ostensibly for a suit to wear tonight. But had baulked at the prices, and bought some books instead, one of which was intended as a gift to Rian: <i>Doctor Zhivago</i>. But then he&#x2019;d decided he&#x2019;d like to read it himself first, and so had brought flowers and chocolates instead, forgetting her aversion to lilies ( <i>had he known in the first place?</i>) and the diet she was in the throes of starting. Damn. And to cap it all, he&#x2019;d tried a new church this morning, another Church of Scotland offering, not too far from his flat. The last one he&#x2019;d tried had seemed unbearably cold, promising nothing but sin and repentance, but this latest church had been the oppressive opposite: all love and joy and what was there to forgive anyway? So he&#x2019;d sung the hymns, then buggered off, leaving the minister with a handshake at the door and a promise of future attendance. <p></p>&#x2018;More wine, John?&#x2019; <p></p>This was the bookseller, proffering the bottle he&#x2019;d brought himself. It wasn&#x2019;t a bad little wine, actually, but the bookseller had talked about it with such unremitting pride that Rebus felt obliged to decline. The man frowned, but then was cheered to find this refusal left all the more for himself. He replenished his glass with vigour. <p></p>&#x2018;Cheers,&#x2019; he said. <p></p>The conversation returned to how busy Edinburgh seemed these days. Here was something with which Rebus could agree. This being the end of May, the tourists were almost in season. But there was more to it than that. If anyone had told him five years ago that in 1989 people would be emigrating north from the south of England to the Lothians, he&#x2019;d have laughed out loud. Now it was fact, and a fit topic for the dinner table. <p></p>Later, much later, the couple having departed, Rebus helped Rian with the dishes. <p></p>&#x2018;What was wrong with you?&#x2019; she said, but all he could think about was the minister&#x2019;s handshake, that confident grip which bespoke assurances of an afterlife. <p></p>&#x2018;Nothing,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s leave these till morning.&#x2019; <p></p>Rian stared at the kitchen, counting the used pots, the half-eaten lobster carcasses, the wine glasses smudged with grease. <p></p>&#x2018;Okay,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;What did you have in mind instead?&#x2019; <p></p>He raised his eyebrows slowly, then brought them down low over his eyes. His lips broadened into a smile which had about it a touch of the leer. She became coy. <p></p>&#x2018;Why, Inspector,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;Is that supposed to be some kind of a clue?&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Here&#x2019;s another,&#x2019; he said, lunging at her, hugging her to him, his face buried in her neck. She squealed, clenched fists beating against his back. <p></p>&#x2018;Police brutality!&#x2019; she gasped. &#x2018;Help! Police, help!&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Yes, madam?&#x2019; he inquired, carrying her by the waist out of the kitchen, towards where the bedroom and the end of the weekend waited in shadow. <p></p>LATE EVE NING at a building site on the outskirts of Edinburgh. The contract was for the construction of an office development. A fifteen-foot-high fence separated the works from the main road. The road, too, was of recent vintage, built to help ease traffic congestion around the city. Built so that commuters could travel easily from their countryside dwellings to jobs in the city centre. <p></p>There were no cars on the road to night. The only sound came from the slow chug-chugging of a cement mixer on the site. A man was feeding it spadefuls of grey sand and remembering the far distant days when he had laboured on a building site. Hard graft it had been, but honest. <p></p>Two other men stood above a deep pit, staring down into it. &#x2018;Should do it,&#x2019; one said. <p></p>&#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; the other agreed. They began walking back to the car, an ageing purple Mercedes. <p></p>&#x2018;He must have some clout. I mean, to get us the keys to this place, to set all this up. Some clout.&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Ours is not to ask questions, you know that.&#x2019; The man who spoke was the oldest of the three, and the only Calvinist. He opened the car boot. Inside, the body of a frail teenager lay crumpled, obviously dead. His skin was the colour of pencil shading, darkest where the bruises lay. <p></p>&#x2018;What a waste,&#x2019; said the Calvinist. <p></p>&#x2018;Aye,&#x2019; the other agreed. Together they lifted the body from the boot, and carried it gently towards the hole. It dropped softly to the bottom, one leg wedging up against the sticky clay sides, a trouser leg slipping to show a naked ankle. <p></p>&#x2018;All right,&#x2019; the Calvinist said to the cement man. &#x2018;Cover it, and let&#x2019;s get out of here. I&#x2019;m starving.&#x2019; <p></p>Excerpted from Hide And Seek by IAN RANKIN. <p></p>Copyright � 1990 by Ian Rankin. <p></p>Published in 1990 by St. Martin&#x2019;s Press <p></p>All rights reserved.

And yet, as missional faith communities are well aware, the tensions and conflicts between holiness and mercy are not so easily resolved. At every turn, it seems that the psychological pull of purity and holiness tempts the church into practices of social exclusion and a Gnostic flight from &#34;the world&#34; into a &#34;too spiritual&#34; spirituality. Moreover, the psychology of purity often lures the church into what psychologists call &#34;The Macbeth Effect&#34; the psychological trap that tempts us into believing that ritual acts of cleansing can replace moral and missional engagement. Finally, time after time, wherever we see churches regulating their common life with the idiom of dirt, disgust, and defilement, we find a predictable wake of dysfunction: ruined self-images, social stigma, and communal conflict. In an unprecedented fusion of psychological science and theological scholarship, Richard Beck describes the pernicious (and largely unnoticed) effects of the psychology of purity upon the life and mission of the church.</p><p>Richard Beck is Professor of Psychology at Abilene Christian University. This is his first book but he has published extensively in the empirical literature concerning the intersection of Christian faith and psychology."...Noteworthy and full of insights, Unclean is a recommended reading for anyone interested in the psychological- and theological- aspects of purity in the church..."

The opening chapters discuss the life of Tutankhamen and earlier archeological work in the Valley of the Kings. An appendix contains fully captioned photographs of the objects obtained from the tomb.

A National Magazine Award winner, he is a regular contributor to <em>The New Yorker </em>online, pens the weekly "Jockology" column in the Toronto <em>Globe and Mail</em>, and writes for the <em>New York Times</em>.

Kennedy wrote an article for <i>Sports Illustrated </i>called &#x201c;The Soft American,&#x201d; lamenting the declining role of physical activity in everyday life. &#x201c;Today human activity, the labor of the human body, is rapidly being engineered out of working life,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;By the 1970s, according to many economists, the man who works with his hands will be almost extinct.&#x201d; That prediction didn&#x2019;t quite pan out&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s certainly true that, for most of us, physical activity is now a choice rather than the necessity it was for our ancestors. Kennedy was concerned that Americans wouldn&#x2019;t have the &#x201c;vigor and determination&#x201d; necessary to match the Soviet Union; today, we&#x2019;ve realized that physical fitness is essential to the health of our bodies and minds. But the basic challenge remains the same: if you&#x2019;ve just begun working out recently, or you&#x2019;re about to head to the gym for the first time, you need to know what to expect. How hard to push, how long it will take to see results, how to make the most of your workout time, how to minimize the risks associated with starting an exercise program&#x2014;these are the issues you should consider before getting started.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>How long does it take to get in shape?</b><br>First, the good news. Your body actually starts getting stronger and healthier just hours after you start working out. But if you&#x2019;re wondering how long it will take to rock a six-pack&#x2014;well, you&#x2019;ll have to be a bit more patient. A few years ago, exercise scientist Megan Anderson and her colleagues at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse put 25 sedentary volunteers through an intense six-week exercise program modeled on the bold claims made by companies such as Bowflex and Body-for-Life. Despite sticking to the program religiously, zero percent of the subjects developed instant washboard abs. In fact, a panel of six judges could detect no differences whatsoever in their physical attractiveness before and after the program.<br>&nbsp;<br>That doesn&#x2019;t mean nothing was happening. After just a few strength training sessions, your brain learns to recruit more muscle fibers and make them contract all at once to produce a greater force. This &#x201c;neural activation&#x201d; kicks in after only a few workouts, allowing you to get stronger almost immediately, well before your muscles get noticeably bigger. Further strength gains come as the individual muscle fibers within your muscles get bigger, which starts in as little as two weeks if you&#x2019;re training intensely. But it takes longer for these changes to be noticeable: even with sophisticated lab equipment, researchers can&#x2019;t usually detect changes in fat and muscle composition until after about nine weeks of training. Similarly, a University of Tokyo study published in 2010 saw the biggest increases in strength after two months and the biggest boost in muscle size after three months. To achieve these rapid gains, the subjects were doing four very hard workouts a week. For the average person at the gym, it will take six months or more to see significant sculpting of the body even though strength has been increasing from day one.<br>&nbsp;<br>Weight loss is more difficult to predict, because it depends on your starting point, your health history, your genetics, and your diet as well as your workout routine. But like strength training, aerobic exercise produces major health and performance benefits long before you see them in the mirror. Aerobic exercise increases the number of mitochondria, which are essentially the &#x201c;cellular power plants&#x201d; in your muscles that use oxygen to produce energy: the more mitochondria you have, the farther and faster you can run, and the more fat your muscles will burn. Studies have found that about six weeks of training will boost mitochondria levels by 50 to 100 percent.<br>&nbsp;<br>Health benefits, on the other hand, kick in after a single bout of aerobic exercise. For about 48 hours after a workout, your muscles will be consuming more glucose than usual, helping to bring down blood-sugar levels. After a few workouts, your insulin sensitivity will begin to improve, offering further control of blood sugar.<br>&nbsp;<br>The bottom line: &#x201c;Getting in shape&#x201d; is a journey that extends over months and even years, but the process&#x2014;and the benefits&#x2014; start as soon as you begin exercising. So if you&#x2019;re having trouble staying motivated without immediate physical changes, track your strength and endurance gains along the way.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Am I exercising enough?</b><br>This is a hugely controversial question, but not in the way you might expect. Almost all experts agree about what the science says&#x2014;but they&#x2019;re bitterly divided about what message they should convey to the public. Decades of research have made two things crystal clear:<br>1. Every bit of exercise helps, even in scraps as short as 10 minutes.<br>2. More is almost always better.<br>&nbsp;<br>The challenge is conveying the second message without discouraging the people who are still struggling with the first. And there are a lot of people struggling: in 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that a quarter of Americans hadn&#x2019;t done any physical activity at all in the previous month. And less than half met the modest government mandated Healthy People 2010 goal of 30 minutes of moderate exercise five times a week. In Canada, only a third of people are meeting a similar goal of 30 minutes at a moderate effort, four times a week.<br>&nbsp;<br>From a public health perspective, the top priority is getting those inactive people to start moving, even a little bit. Going from zero to slightly active offers the biggest possible health boost, according to a recent National Institutes of Health study that followed 250,000 men and women between the ages of 50 and 71. Those who were just slightly active but didn&#x2019;t manage to meet the exercise guidelines were 30 percent less likely to die than those who were totally inactive. Stepping it up to moderate exercise reduced risk by only eight more percent, and adding in some vigorous exercise subtracted an additional 12 percent. When you combine that data, you find that getting half an hour of moderate to vigorous exercise five times a week cuts your risk of dying from all causes in half. So far, so good. The controversy starts when you ask what happens if you do more exercise than the government guidelines recommend. According to researchers like Paul Williams of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, you keep piling up more and more benefits. Williams has been following a cohort of 120,000 runners since 1991, tracking how much they run and what happens to their health. With this enormous sample size, his National Runners&#x2019; Health Study has been able to uncover a pronounced &#x201c;dose&#x2013;response&#x201d; relationship between aerobic exercise and health: the more you do, and the harder you do it, the more benefits you get.<br>&nbsp;<br>What kind of benefits, you ask? Well, in a series of studies stretching back over a decade, Williams has found that the risk of everything from big killers like diabetes, stroke, and heart attack to less common conditions like glaucoma, cataracts, and macular degeneration can be reduced by as much as 70 percent by going beyond the standard exercise guidelines. In every case, the benefits relate to both how much running the subjects do and how fast they do it. For example, every additional mile in your average daily run lowers your glaucoma risk by 8 percent. And speeding up your 10K time by one meter per second (the difference between, say, finishing times of 53 minutes and 40 minutes) lowers heart attack risk by about 50 percent.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is true that overdoing your workout regimen can weaken your immune system (see p. 23), especially if you&#x2019;re not eating and sleeping well. And elite athletes training for hours a day at extremely high intensities sometime suffer from &#x201c;overtraining&#x201d; syndrome. But the message of Williams&#x2019;s research is that the risks of doing too much&#x2014;and these results apply to all forms of aerobic exercise, not just running&#x2014;pale in comparison to the benefits of doing a bit more.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Which should I do first: cardio or weights?</b><br>Let&#x2019;s start with one incontrovertible fact: you can&#x2019;t fulfill your ultimate potential as both a weightlifter and a marathoner at the same time. Too many hours sweating on the elliptical will hinder your ability to put on muscle, and pumping too much iron will slow your endurance gains. But most of us don&#x2019;t want Olympic medals in both events. We just want some combination of reasonable cardiovascular fitness and non-vanishing muscles&#x2014;a desire shared by many elite athletes. Top basketball players, for instance, need strength and explosiveness but also have to last for a full 40 to 60 minutes on the court.<br>&nbsp;<br>The solution, according to Derek Hansen, the head coach for strength and conditioning at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, British Columbia, and a speed consultant to numerous Olympic athletes, is to mix it up. For basketball players, he says, &#x201c;we typically have our athletes lift weights, jump, and sprint one day, then do their aerobic work the next day.&#x201d; When Hansen&#x2019;s court-sport athletes are combining weight training with cardio in a single session, the weights come first, since building power is their first priority.<br>&nbsp;<br>This approach&#x2014;starting with whichever activity is most important to you&#x2014;is widely used by elite athletes. Until recently, scientists thought it was simply a matter of logistics: if you&#x2019;re tired from the treadmill, you can&#x2019;t lift as much weight, so over time you put on less muscle. But new techniques now allow researchers to directly measure which specific proteins are produced in muscles after different types of exercises. It turns out that the sequence of cellular events that leads to bigger muscles is determined in part by the same &#x201c;master switch&#x201d;&#x2014;an enzyme called amp kinase&#x2014; that controls adaptations for better endurance. But you can&#x2019;t have it both ways: the switch is set either to &#x201c;bigger muscles&#x201d; or to &#x201c;better endurance,&#x201d; and the body can&#x2019;t instantly change from one setting to the other. How you start your workout determines which way the switch will be set for the session.<br>&nbsp;<br>So if your goal is beach muscles, your weights routine should come first. If you&#x2019;re preparing for an upcoming 5K race, do your full cardio workout before tacking on weights at the end. And if you&#x2019;re looking for the best of both worlds, Hansen suggests mixing it up, both within a single session and from day to day: &#x201c;The variability will be good, as it challenges your body and metabolism.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Can I get fit in seven minutes a week?</b><br>Breathless claims about exercise regimens that produce near instant results with minimal effort are generally the domain of late-night infomercials. So it might seem surprising that one of the hot topics at the American College of Sports Medicine&#x2019;s annual meeting over the last few years has been research into &#x201c;high-intensity interval training&#x201d; (hit), whose proponents suggest that many of the benefits of traditional endurance training can be achieved with a few short bouts of intense exercise totaling as little as seven minutes a week.<br>&nbsp;<br>Exercise physiologist Martin Gibala and his colleagues at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, have performed a remarkable series of studies in which their subjects cycle as hard as they can for 30 seconds, then rest for four minutes, and repeat four to six times. They do this short workout three times a week. &#x201c;The gains are quite substantial,&#x201d; Gibala says. Compared to control subjects who cycle continuously for up to an hour a day, five times a week, the hit subjects show similar gains in exercise capacity, muscle metabolism, and cardiovascular fitness. In fact, the group&#x2019;s latest study shows that hit improves the structure and function of key arteries that deliver blood to the muscles and heart&#x2014;just like typical cardio training. Similar studies by University of Guelph researcher Jason Talanian have found that high-intensity interval training also increases the body&#x2019;s ability to burn fat, an effect that persists even during lower-intensity activities following the interval training.<br>&nbsp;<br>The results are no surprise to elite cyclists, runners, and swimmers, who have relied on interval training for decades to achieve peak performance. To break the four-minute mile in 1954, Roger Bannister famously relied on interval sessions of ten 60-second sprints separated by two minutes of rest, because his duties as a medical student on clinical rotation limited his training time to half an hour a day at lunch. Such time constraints are the main reason Gibala advocates hit, since studies consistently find that lack of time is the top reason that people don&#x2019;t manage to get the 30 minutes of daily exercise recommended by public health guidelines. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not saying that it&#x2019;s a panacea that has all the benefits of endurance training,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s a way that people can get away with less.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>More recent studies have started to piece together exactly how hit sessions work. A study at the University of Western Ontario compared volunteers who ran four to six 30-second sprints with four minutes&#x2019; rest (just like Gibala&#x2019;s hit workout for cycling) with another group running steadily for 30 to 60 minutes at a time. After six weeks of training three times a week, both groups made identical gains in endurance and lost similar amounts of fat. In the &#x201c;long runs&#x201d; group, the endurance gains came from increases in the amount of blood pumped by the heart; in the hit group, almost all the gains came from the muscles themselves, which improved their ability to extract oxygen from circulating blood. Since it&#x2019;s important to have a healthy heart <i>and </i>healthy muscles, this suggests you shouldn&#x2019;t rely exclusively on hit workouts. As with cardio and weights, a mixture is best.<br>&nbsp;<br>High-intensity exercise is generally thought to carry some risks, so sedentary or older people should check with a doctor before trying hit. Interestingly, though, University of British Columbia researcher Darren Warburton has studied hit training in cancer and heart disease patients and found that these higher-risk populations can also benefit safely from hit. There is one catch&#x2014;the disclaimer at the end of the infomercial, if you will. To cram the benefits of an hour-long workout into a few short minutes, you also have to compress the effort you would have spent. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the trade-off,&#x201d; Gibala says. &#x201c;Going all out is uncomfortable. It hurts.&#x201d; But at least with this approach, it&#x2019;s over quickly.</p><h2>The Sneaky Chef: Simple Strategies for Hiding Healthy Foods in Kids&#39; Favorite Meals</h2><p>Parents will do almost anything to get their kids to eat healthier, but unfortunately, they've found that begging, pleading, threatening, and bribing don't work.

At this point, having trained and seen the benefits of looking within, the student begins to shift their focus outward to the broader world. Formal entry into the mahayana occurs with taking the bodhisattva vow. Mahayana practitioners dedicate themselves to the service of all sentient beings, aspiring to save them from sorrow and confusion, and vowing to bring them to perfect liberation. This stage of the path emphasizes the cultivation of wisdom through the view and experience of emptiness, or shunyata, in which all phenomena are seen to be unbounded, completely open, ungraspable, and profound. From the ground of shunyata, compassionate activity is said to arise naturally and spontaneously. In addition to mindfulness and awareness, the mahayanist practices lojong, or "mind training," based on the cultivation of the paramitas, or "transcendent virtues": generosity, discipline, patience, exertion, meditation, and prajna, or "knowledge." As a component of lojong, tonglen, or "sending and taking," is practiced in order to increase maitri, or loving-kindness. <br><br><i>The Profound Treasury of the Ocean of Dharma</i> represents meditation master Ch�gyam Trungpa's greatest contribution to Western Buddhism.

He&#x2019;d grown up in these swamps, hearing the bullfrogs, the bellow of the alligator and the plop of snakes sliding from the cypress trees into the dark waters. The constant drone of insects had been his lullaby. The soft fall of rain didn&#x2019;t bring the cold, rather just ratcheted up the heat, wrapping one up in a blanket of humidity and the strange perfume of the swamp.</p><p>He let his breath out slowly, just drinking in the sights around him. He&#x2019;d always felt at home in the bayou. He&#x2019;d never really much liked going other places, but now, he wasn&#x2019;t certain it was the smartest thing in the world for him to be back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yet. He couldn&#x2019;t breathe in cities, yet now that he&#x2019;d come home, he found his chest was tight and his famous Cajun temper had settled into a slow boil in the pit of his stomach.</p><p>&#x201c;You all right, Wyatt?&#x201d; Malichai Fortunes asked softly. He stood just to the left of Wyatt, in the deeper shadows of the sweeping cypress, impossible to see until he moved.</p><p>Wyatt glanced at him. Malichai was a big man, all roped muscle and cool, with strange, almost golden eyes. He looked into a man, cutting straight through to who and what he was. Wyatt had learned to trust him implicitly. They were both bone weary. Exhausted. Four months and over four hundred rescue operations, most conducted in the &#x201c;hot&#x201d; zones of war. The last had gone to hell and them with it.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;m all right. Just breathing in home,&#x201d; he replied.</p><p>The scent of pipe tobacco drifted to him. The slight wind rustled through the trees, swaying the branches in a macabre fashion. He&#x2019;d always enjoyed taking his city friends out into the swamp at night and scaring the hell out of them before taking them to one of the backwoods bars where they could get drunk and fight with anyone who looked at them wrong.</p><p>He could fish with a string or a knife. He could kill a gator with a knife or gun. He was one of the best hunters in the swamps. Few of the boys who knew him ever challenged him to a fight. His word was gold all over the swamp and bayous. He&#x2019;d studied long and hard to be a doctor, a surgeon, one that could come home and be of great use here in the bayou. It wasn&#x2019;t that he couldn&#x2019;t have left&#x2014;he hadn&#x2019;t wanted to leave. There was a huge difference.</p><p>He let out his breath again and scrubbed his hand down his face, wishing he could wipe his memories of his own damn foolishness away so easily.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you tell your <i>grand-mere</i> we were coming with you?&#x201d; Ezekiel Fortunes, Malichai&#x2019;s brother, asked softly. Too softly. His voice was almost a rolling purr in the night, like that of a cat waiting for prey.</p><p>Wyatt glanced at the third man on the airboat, the man to his right. Ezekiel was an inch or so shorter than either of the other two, but he had the same roped muscles and solid build. His eyes, a strange amber color, glowed in the dark just as Wyatt&#x2019;s and Malichai&#x2019;s did. All three could see as easily at night as they could during the day, which gave them a decided advantage in night combat situations.</p><p>&#x201c;Nonny&#x2019;s expecting all three of us,&#x201d; Wyatt said. &#x201c;And you two had better be on your best behavior. She&#x2019;s good at grabbing ears and twisting if you get out of line.&#x201d; He rubbed his ear, a little grin slowly finding its way to his mouth at the memory of quite a few of those ear-pulling incidents. &#x201c;War wounds aren&#x2019; goin&#x2019; to save you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s a good cook?&#x201d; Malichai asked. &#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m starving.&#x201d;</p><p>Wyatt and Ezekiel both laughed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re always starving.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We never get to eat. Someone&#x2019;s always trying to kill us,&#x201d; Malichai complained. He looked around him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet there&#x2019;s good hunting here.&#x201d;</p><p>Wyatt nodded slowly. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re resting, boys. Resting and relaxing. Not hunting. These people are my neighbors. They&#x2019;ll want to drink with you and fight with you, but you don&#x2019;t get to kill them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You sure do know how to take the fun out of a party,&#x201d; Ezekiel groused.</p><p>Wyatt stepped off the airboat to the solid wooden pier. The last time he&#x2019;d been home, he&#x2019;d fixed the rotting boards and it was still in fine shape. He&#x2019;d been afraid his grandmother would have tried to repair the dock in spite of her age and failing health. That would be just like her. It was the last thing he&#x2019;d done for her before he&#x2019;d left&#x2014;in the dead of night&#x2014;without a word. Skulking away like some sulking child just because he got his heart ripped out. No, because he <i>thought</i> he got his heart ripped out, which was infinitely worse.</p><p>He just stood there another minute, reluctant to walk up to the house, knowing his grandmother would welcome him with open arms, and not one hint of censure, but he felt guilty. He kept trying to think of what to say to her. There were no words. None at all. She would know the moment she saw him, the moment she looked into his eyes and saw what he&#x2019;d done, that he&#x2019;d been changed for all time&#x2014;just as his brother Raoul had been.</p><p>&#x201c;What is it, Wyatt?&#x201d; Malichai asked again. His voice was pitched low and he used that same purring tone of the hunter Ezekiel had used.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll know. Nonny. The minute she lays eyes on me, she&#x2019;ll know what I am.&#x201d;</p><p>Ezekiel looked out over the bayou, avoiding his gaze.</p><p>Malichai shook his head. &#x201c;No, she won&#x2019;t, Wyatt. She&#x2019;ll know you&#x2019;re different in some way, but she won&#x2019;t know what you are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I left a doctor, a healer.&#x201d; Wyatt looked down at his hands. &#x201c;I came back a killer. You tell me how she isn&#x2019;t going to know that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have to stay,&#x201d; Ezekiel reminded, his tone noncommittal. &#x201c;We can turn around and get the hell out of here if that makes you feel any better.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She asked me to come home,&#x201d; Wyatt said. &#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t ever ask for much. She said she needed help, and my other brothers are out of the country at the moment. I had leave comin&#x2019; and knew I had to face her sooner or later. It&#x2019;s been a while, but the bayou still feels like home.&#x201d;</p><p>Malichai looked around him slowly. &#x201c;It feels like a hunting ground to me.&#x201d;</p><p>The Fontenot home was old, even for the bayou, but kept in very good shape. Iron gates and a large fence kept the property private with its own pier off the river. Nonny&#x2019;s hunting dogs had set up a cry when the airboat had first arrived, but Wyatt had sent them a quick, silent command and they&#x2019;d ceased baying immediately.</p><p>There were two large buildings, the house and a garage. The garage had double pull-down doors and a single, smaller entrance, all locked with padlocks. The house was two stories, with a balcony and a wraparound deck.</p><p>&#x201c;This is nice, Wyatt,&#x201d; Malichai said. &#x201c;A sweet setup.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It started out as a frame house, very traditional,&#x201d; Wyatt said. &#x201c;One and a half stories, with a <i>galerie</i> raised on pillars to keep it from the soggy ground. We&#x2019;ve got good frontage on the bayou, which allowed us good access to the waterways. We have plenty of woods to hunt, and we harvested trees to help build this. We have fields for growin&#x2019;, and Grand-mere had the touch when it came to plantin&#x2019;. We did all right.&#x201d; There was pride in his voice. &#x201c;We built the house, my brothers and me, for Nonny.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s amazing, Wyatt. What a place to grow up in,&#x201d; Malichai said. He glanced at his brother. &#x201c;We could have done some damage here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d have been able to eat once in a while,&#x201d; Ezekiel said, with another slow look around him. &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t need much more than this place.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s always plenty to eat here,&#x201d; Wyatt assured and stepped back, waving them forward. &#x201c;Seriously, with four big boys to feed, Nonny was trappin&#x2019; and huntin&#x2019; and fishin&#x2019; every day. She wanted us all in school to get an education. Then she had a heart attack and Raoul&#x2014;Gator, we call him here in the bayou&#x2014;he snuck away from school and helped out with supplyin&#x2019; us with food. &#x2019;Course when the rest of us did it, Gator beat the crap out of us.&#x201d; Wyatt laughed at the memory.</p><p>&#x201c;We know about beating the crap out of people,&#x201d; Malichai said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s usually how we got our food.&#x201d;</p><p>Ezekiel nodded. &#x201c;We got real good at it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Grand-mere is in her eighties with a bad heart. Don&#x2019; go makin&#x2019; her cut down a switch to use on either of you,&#x201d; Wyatt warned, half teasing, but more serious. &#x201c;Because she would if you don&#x2019; mind your manners.&#x201d;</p><p>Ezekiel glanced uneasily toward the house. &#x201c;Wyatt, we&#x2019;ve never had a family. It&#x2019;s always been the three of us. Malichai, Mordichai, and me. We&#x2019;re not exactly civilized. Are you certain you want to bring us into your home?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m certain. Nonny will be happy for the company. There&#x2019;s no other place to just relax and rest. The moment she knows you both were wounded, expect to be spoiled. She cracks the whip when we need it, but she&#x2019;s always been the glue that holds our family together. You&#x2019;re going to love her.&#x201d;</p><p>Ezekiel took a long slow look around. &#x201c;Mordichai would love it here. He&#x2019;s hanging with Joe, making sure he pulls through, then he plans to join us. This is his kind of place.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Damn straight, it is,&#x201d; Malichai agreed.</p><p>&#x201c;Wyatt. Boy, come on in and stop swappin&#x2019; lies out there. There&#x2019;s been a couple of gators gettin&#x2019; all frisky lately on the lawn. I wouldn&#x2019; want you to run into them. And the Rougarou has been a visitin&#x2019; folks up and down these parts lately. Wouldn&#x2019;t want you or your friends to be caught out in the open.&#x201d; Grand-mere&#x2019;s<i> </i>voice cut through the night. Clear. Crisp. Welcoming.</p><p>Wyatt smiled for the first time. Just the sound of her voice settled the knots in his gut. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re smokin&#x2019; that pipe again, Nonny. I thought the doc told you to stop.&#x201d;</p><p><i>What the hell is Rougarou?</i> Malichai asked, using telepathic communication.</p><p><i>Local legend mainly used to scare the crap out of wayward boys to keep them out of the swamps and bayous at night</i>, Wyatt answered with a quick grin. <i>Not that the tactic was particularly successful.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Doc&#x2019;s not even wet behin&#x2019; the ears yet, Wyatt,&#x201d; his grandmother said. &#x201c;I ben smokin&#x2019; this pipe nigh onto seventy years now. I&#x2019;m not about to quit now.&#x201d;</p><p>She was sitting in an old sturdy, hand-carved rocking chair on the verandah, pipe in one hand and a shotgun close to the other. Wyatt frowned when he saw the gun. He took the pier in several long strides, covered the circular drive and the lawn in a few leaps and landed on the porch in a crouch beside his grandmother.</p><p>She was very small and fragile looking, the shotgun nearly as big as she was, but her hands were rock steady. She wore her silver white hair braided and looped in a bun at the back of her head. Her skin was thin and pale, but her eyes were clear and just as steady as her hands.</p><p>&#x201c;What the hell&#x2019;s goin&#x2019; on, Nonny? Did someone threaten&#x2019; you?&#x201d;</p><p>She took the pipe from her mouth. &#x201c;Greet me properly, boy. I been a missin&#x2019; you for a long while now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. You worried me holdin&#x2019; that shotgun so close.&#x201d; He leaned in to kiss her on both cheeks. &#x201c;You smell like home. Spicy pipe tobacco, gumbo and fresh-baked bread. I&#x2019;m never home until I get close to you, Nonny.&#x201d;</p><p>Nonny blinked back pleased tears and turned her face away from him. &#x201c;Since when did you learn to leap around like a jungle cat, Wyatt? They teach you such things in the service?&#x201d;</p><p>Wyatt&#x2019;s heart jumped. He hadn&#x2019;t thought about using his enhancements in front of his grandmother. &#x201c;I learned to run fast right here in the bayou tryin&#x2019; to get away from that switch of yours.&#x201d; At least that wasn&#x2019;t a lie.</p><p>She gave a little sniff as she looked past Wyatt to the two men who followed him much more slowly. Her sharp eyes couldn&#x2019;t help but notice that the taller of the two was limping and the shorter one had dropped back behind him, almost as if he were a little reluctant to come here, but clearly he was really looking out for the other one, his gaze sweeping the bayou and surrounding buildings constantly.</p><p>She stepped up to the porch column, studying both men. &#x201c;Are you hurt too, Wyatt? It seems the lot of you are all injured in some way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We took some fire,&#x201d; Wyatt admitted. &#x201c;Helicopter went down and we were trapped behind enemy lines, but we made it out. Each of us took a hit or two, but we&#x2019;re good. We&#x2019;ve come to help you out with your problem and maybe get a little rest and recoup.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just what does &#x2018;a hit or two&#x2019; mean in terms of injuries, Wyatt?&#x201d; There was a note in his grandmother&#x2019;s voice warning him she wanted information.</p><p>Wyatt sighed. Sometimes there was no getting around his grandmother. She could be stubborn and tough when she wanted to be. &#x201c;Malichai took a hit in the leg. It was pretty bad, but I was able to repair the damage right there. Ezekiel took both of us down, protecting us when someone lobbed a mortar in our direction. His back took the brunt of the fire. And I had a couple of smaller injuries, a ricochet when the helicopter first took fire and a stab wound just below my heart. Joe, our pilot got the worst of it, but Mordichai, Zeke and Malichai&#x2019;s brother, is with him, seein&#x2019; to him.&#x201d;</p><p>Nonny closed her eyes for a moment and hugged the pillar tighter. She swallowed hard and then took a deep breath and nodded. &#x201c;Thank the good Lord none of you were killed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019; even close, Grand-mere,&#x201d; Wyatt lied, and kissed her cheek. &#x201c;I want you to meet my good friends.&#x201d;</p><p>The two men made it to the stairs and halted. Neither took a step closer. There was no denying the way their eyes glowed like a cat&#x2019;s in the dark. His grandmother had been hunting all her life. She wouldn&#x2019;t fail to notice such a detail, but she simply smiled at them both.</p><p>&#x201c;Any friend of Wyatt&#x2019;s is welcome here. I expect you&#x2019;re both hungry. There&#x2019;s always food on the stove. Simple, but nourishin&#x2019;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nonny, this is Ezekiel and Malichai Fortunes. My <i>grand-mere</i>, Grace Fontenot. Nonny.&#x201d; Wyatt introduced.</p><p>He couldn&#x2019;t keep the notes of love and of pride out of his voice. His grandmother had raised four big Cajun boys, pretty much on her own, and they&#x2019;d been wild. In truth, he&#x2019;d brought Ezekiel and Malichai home with him not only because they were his best friends, but because he felt both of them could use a good dose of his grandmother. They needed to know what home and family really was. The cat in them was always seeking to get the upper hand with its need to hunt.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you for having us, Mrs. Fontenot,&#x201d; Malichai said, his tone very formal.</p><p>&#x201c;Call me Nonny. Everyone around here does,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And Ezekiel, thank you for shieldin&#x2019; my grandson when you were takin&#x2019; such good care of your brother.&#x201d;</p><p>Ezekiel ducked his head, embarrassed.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am&#x2014;Nonny,&#x201d; Malichai murmured, and came up the stairs as if there might be a hidden...</p></p><h2>It is the Responsibility of Intellectuals to speak the truth and to expose lies</h2><p><b>Selected by <i>Newsweek</i> as one of &#x201c;14 nonfiction books you&#x2019;ll want to read this fall&#x201d;<br><br>Fifty years after it first appeared, one of Noam Chomsky&#x2019;s greatest essays will be published for the first time as a timely stand-alone book, with a new preface by the author</b><br><p>As a nineteen-year-old undergraduate in 1947, Noam Chomsky was deeply affected by articles about the responsibility of intellectuals written by Dwight Macdonald, an editor of <em>Partisan Review</em> and then of <em>Politics</em>.

In medicine I was only taught that yeast was either a pesky vaginitis or a life-threatening blood infection in hospitalized patients on numerous IV antibiotics. Dr. William Crook was one of the pioneers in the field and in my naturopathic training I learned about his work and began treating yeast in the early 1980's.</p> <p>In 1986, because I was known as the local expert on treating yeast, I had the honor of being a guest with Dr. Crook on a television talk show called &#x201c;Speaking Out with Harry Brown&#x201d; in Toronto. During our ninety-minute program the station's phone lines were flooded with calls. They tabulated 80,000 people trying to reach the show to ask about yeast. In the aftermath, the station received countless requests for transcripts from the public, doctors, and hospital clinics. Dr. Crook and his emphasis on yeast had really struck a chord.</p> <p>I've even begun to call Dr. Crook's type of yeast Crook's Candidiasis to differentiate it from the medical definition of yeast as a vaginitis or a blood infection.</p> <p>Crook's Candidiasis encompasses:</p> <p>1. Yeast in the intestines that overgrow and change from a budding state to an invasive state under the influence of antibiotics, birth control pills, cortisone, and a refined sugar diet causing intestinal inflammation and leaky gut syndrome including symptoms of IBS;</p> <p>2. Allergic reactions to yeast that cause burning and itching of various parts of the body including nasal membranes, sinuses, skin, and vagina;</p> <p>3. Multiple and sometimes severe reactions in the body to the almost 180 yeast toxic by-products and waste products, either by direct toxic reactions or allergic reactions to these yeast by-products as they pass into the bloodstream due to leaky gut.</p> <p>4. Body-wide allergic reactions and toxic reactions to undigested food molecules, bacterial toxins, and parasitic toxins that pass into the bloodstream due to leaky gut.</p> <p>I never forgot my meeting with Dr. Crook. His generosity and caring were palpable and his legacy is contained in books such as the <strong><em>Yeast Connection Cookbook</em></strong> and <strong><em>The Yeast Connection Handbook</em> </strong>which are modern-day classics. The basis of treating yeast and keeping it under control is diet. There is no drug nor will there ever be a drug that eliminates yeast or that deals with the massive toxic reactions that you see in Crook's Candidiasis.</p> <p>The key to getting yeast under control is to follow a diet that starves yeast by not feeding them sugar and other foods that they crave. That's why this book is so important and vital to your success with a yeast program. And if you repopulate your gut with beneficial organisms called probiotics found in organic yogurt (with no added sugar) or probiotic capsules you will do even better. You can learn about the six-step yeast-fighting plan at www.yeastconnection.com.</p> <p>Since I began treating yeast there have been many breakthroughs in diet and supplements that make your battle with yeast much easier. In health-food stores and large supermarkets you can find numerous wheat-free products; a natural sweetener called Stevia; non-dairy milks&#x2015;soy, almond, rice; chemical-free cleaning products and cosmetics. At yeastconnection.com there are natural supplements that treat vaginitis and yeast overgrowth. Yeastconnection.com also offers an invaluable series of teleconferences on yeast and wellness that make it much easier for you to begin your yeast-fighting journey and to find support on your way.</p> <p>I'm honored to be the medical advisor to yeastconnection.com and work with Dr. Crook's daughter, Elizabeth Crook, as we continue his valuable work.</p> <p>&#x2015;Dr. Carolyn Dean</p></p><h2>A Walk on the Wild Side: A Novel</h2><p><p>With its depictions of the downtrodden prostitutes, bootleggers, and hustlers of Perdido Street in the old French Quarter of 1930s New Orleans, <i>A Walk in the Wild Side</i> has found a place in the imaginations of all generations since it first appeared. As Algren admitted, the book "wasn't written until long after it had been walked . . . I found my way to the streets on the other side of the Southern Pacific station, where the big jukes were singing something called 'Walking the Wild Side of Life.' I've stayed pretty much on that side of the curb ever since."</p><p>Perhaps the author's own words describe this classic work best: "The book asks why lost people sometimes develop into greater human beings than those who have never been lost in their whole lives. Why men who have suffered at the hands of other men are the natural believers in humanity, while those whose part has been simply to acquire, to take all and give nothing, are the most contemptuous of mankind."</p></p><p>With its depictions of the downtrodden prostitutes, bootleggers, and hustlers of Perdido Street in the old French Quarter of 1930s New Orleans, A Walk on the Wild Side found a place in the imaginations of all the generations that have followed since.

From biographical reflections on traditional saints and spiritual masters (including Dorothy Day, Henri Nouwen, Thomas Merton, Flannery O&#39;Connor, and Oscar Romero), he reflects on what it means to read the spiritual text that is written in such lives. From that, we learn to read our own lives in the same light.</p><p><b>Robert Ellsberg,</b> publisher and editor-in-chief of Orbis Books, is the author of many books, including <i>All Saints, Blessed Among All Women, The Saints' Guide to Happiness,</i> and <i>Blessed Among Us</i> (based on his daily reflections for Give Us This Day). A former managing editor of <i>The Catholic Worker,</i> he has edited the selected writings, diaries, and letters of Dorothy Day.<p><em>&#x201c;Robert Ellsberg has written perhaps the most essential illuminant for these darkening times. . . . This is an indelible meditation on living, breathing holiness. . . . </em><em>For the stories gathered here -- the lives of some half-dozen not-yet-sainted but certainly saintly, among them Thomas Merton, Henri Nouwen, Flannery O&#x2019;Connor, and [Dorothy] Day herself -- are presented with such nuance, in all their complexity and shadow (scrubbed of neither sin nor flaw nor foible). Ellsberg has more than met his hope of making saintliness a participatory endeavor, one open to any and all.&#x201d;</em>&#x2014;<strong>Barbara Mahany, <em>Chicago Tribune</em></strong></p> <p><em>&#x201c;A tremendous and compulsively readable book. One of the best books on the saints I've ever read.&#x201d;</em>&#x2014;<strong>James Martin, SJ, author, <em>Jesus: A Pilgrimage</em> and <em>My Life with the Saints&nbsp;</em></strong></p> <p><em>&#x201c;Robert Ellsberg&#x2019;s </em>A Living Gospel<em> is the most meaningful work of hagiography I have ever read.

This book will stretch your ideas of what it means to be holy in this day and age.&#x201d;</em>&#x2014;<strong>Joan Chittister</strong></p> <p><em>&#x201c;This book is a thoughtful account of what makes a truly faithful life, reminding us that God is always at work within each one of us. Ellsberg describes the process of holiness,that gradual movement into alignment with God&#x2019;s will, with incredible perception and wisdom. The examples of lives well lived (including Dorothy Day, Thomas Merton, and Henri Nouwen), along with his depiction of grace, humility, and justice are challenging, meaningful, and life-giving.&#x201d;</em>&#x2014;<strong>Jim Wallis, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>America&#x2019;s Original Sin, </em>editor-in-chief of <em>Sojourners</em> magazine</strong></p> <p><em>&#x201c;Drawing on a lifetime of reflection on saints and holy lives (including those he has known), Robert Ellsberg calls our attention to the deepest function of such stories: to help us recognize the patterns of grace in our own lives, and to respond more faithfully to our own call to holiness.&#x201d;</em>&#x2014;<strong>Richard Rohr, Center for Action and Contemplation</strong></p> <p><em>&nbsp;&#x201c;In this beautiful book, Robert Ellsberg shares the gift of the saints&#x2014;not unreachable, perfect people, floating in prayer, but real human beings who lived close to the ground, who sought to follow Jesus despite their own flaws and their moments of doubt and disbelief; in other words, people like us. Robert&#x2019;s own life has been shaped by his encounters with such figures. Isn&#x2019;t that the way it is for all of us? We come to know Jesus through those who love him. And through their witness we find the courage to take one step, and then another, along his path of discipleship.&#x201d;</em>&#x2014;<strong>Sister Helen Prejean, author, <em>Dead Man Walking</em> </strong></p></p><h2>The Life-Giving Sword: Secret Teachings from the House of the Shogun</h2><p>The legendary seventeenth-century swordsman Yagyu Munenori was the sword instructor and military and political adviser to two shoguns&#x2014;and was a rival to the great Miyamoto Musashi. Despite his martial ability and his political power, Munenori spent his life immersed in Zen teachings and practice. These teachings formed the framework for his deeply spiritual approach to sword fighting; Munenori saw in the practice of the sword a way to transform the student into a total human being. <i>The Life-Giving Sword</i> is Munenori&#x2019;s manifesto on his approach. His central themes are the &#x201c;Life-Giving Sword&#x201d;&#x2014;the idea of controlling one&#x2019;s opponent by spiritual readiness to fight rather than by actual fighting&#x2014;and &#x201c;No Sword,&#x201d; which is the idea that the mind must be free of everything, even the sword itself, in order to get to the place of complete mastery. Munenori&#x2019;s ideas are essential reading for martial artists of all kinds and can be applied to business and human relations as well.</p><p>William Scott Wilson is the foremost translator into English of traditional Japanese texts on samurai culture. His best-selling translations include <i>Hagakure</i> and <i>The Book of Five Rings</i>.Just in time to capitalize on the cinematic vogue for samurai epics comes this new translation of a classic 17th-century Japanese swordsmanship manual. Heavily influenced by Zen Buddhism, Munenori, a swordsmanship instructor to several Shoguns, downplays the training and extols the spiritual enlightenment and life lessons to be gained through martial arts. A few rules of thumb like "you attain the victory by having your opponent make the first move" and "it is dangerous to get any closer than one foot" could be useful in a sword fight, but actual combat maneuvers like Billowing Clouds, Flower Wheel and Sword of Mystery must be learned through "oral transmission" since "they are difficult to express in written words." (A lengthy appendix taken from another source, containing period illustrations and detailed but still opaque instructions on fighting moves, confirms this insight.) Instead of specific routines, Munenori emphasizes the attainment of No-Mind, the Zen version of "flow" in which one's swordplay proceeds without self-conscious thought. The book's philosophy, it must be said, is also pretty difficult to express in written words, and is conveyed through poetic imagery ("with a pilfered glance, the dragonfly evades the shrike") and mystic paradoxes ("that which is called existence is nothing other than non-existence, and that which is called non-existence is none other than existence.") Munenori's rambling exposition of it may lead readers to conclude that, whatever wisdom comes of a lifetime of sword fighting, it doesn't impart a polished literary sensibility. Fortunately, Wilson, translator of several samurai works, includes a substantial biography of Munenori that illuminates the political and cultural background of the samurai ethos and clarifies Munenori's doctrines for novice readers.

She had dropped out of college, was halfheartedly acting in television commercials, and was carrying on with an older married man when her life was changed, in an instant, by a phone call. Her parents had been in a devastating car accident. Neither was expected to survive. In her first memoir, Shapiro offers this powerful true story of a life turned around&#x2014;not by miracles or happy endings, but by unexpected personal catastrophe.</p></p><p>Dani Shapiro was rescued by tragedy. At the age of 23 she is a wreck. A Sarah Lawrence college dropout, she is living as the mistress--one of many, she would later find out--of her best friend's stepfather, Lenny, a high-profile New York City lawyer. It is the height of the excessive '80s, and Lenny goes to extravagant lengths to keep his woman--putting her up in a large downtown apartment, draping her in furs and flashy gems, and spiriting her away by Concorde to Paris for weekend flings. When she isn't with Lenny, Shapiro leisurely courts an acting and modeling career and actively pursues her drug dealer, who delivers cocaine to her door. She is at an expensive spa in California--at a far remove from the middle-class, orthodox Jewish home in which she was raised--when, one snowy night, her parents' car careens into a highway median. When she returns to New Jersey, to her parents' hospital bedsides, she begins the journey to discover and mine her inner strength. She succeeds, and though the process is as arduous as it is painful, Shapiro finds within herself the power to nurse her mother through nearly 100 broken bones, to survive her father's death, and to reset the course of her life. <i>Slow Motion</i> ends where its subject's troubles began: with Shapiro, newly single, re-enrolling as an undergrad at Sarah Lawrence.<p> Shapiro, who is the author of three previous novels, writes sparely and lacks the excessive self-consciousness that plagues some memoirs. She develops her story carefully, drawing readers ever closer into her most intimate thoughts and fears. This honest, and sometimes brutal account of loss and recovery is an inspiration.</p>the most gifted writers of her&nbsp;&nbsp;generation comes the harrowing and exqui-sitely written true story of how a family tragedy saved her life. Dani Shapiro was a young girl from a deeply religious home who became the girlfriend of a famous and flamboyant married attorney--her best friend's stepfather. The moment Lenny Klein entered her life, everything changed: she dropped out of college, began to drink heavily, and became estranged from her family and friends. But then the&nbsp;&nbsp;phone call came. There had been an accident on a snowy road near her family's home in New Jersey, and both her parents lay hospitalized in critical condition. This haunting memoir traces her journey back into the world she had left behind. At a time when she was barely able to take care of herself, she was faced with the terrifying task of taking care of two people who needed her desperately.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dani Shapiro charts a riveting emotional cours</p><h2>Everything Is Workable: A Zen Approach to Conflict Resolution</h2><p><b>Using mindfulness to work with and resolve the inevitable interpersonal conflicts that arise in all areas of life.</b><i><br><br>"Wonderfully engaging, perceptive, and wise."&#x2014;William L.

On one level this is a highly useful guidebook packed with great ideas for enlightened traveling--tape recording local voices, music, and sounds; asking contemplative questions to waitresses and bookstore owners; lighting a traveling candle every morning; making an offering to the local deity. But most compelling is Cousineau's ability to expertly map the interior landscape of a pilgrimage--the sights that lead to insights and the borders that lead to breakthroughs as we trek the exterior landscape of our planet. --<i>Gail Hudson</i><p><strong>Phil Cousineau</strong>&nbsp;is an award-winning writer and filmmaker, teacher and editor, lecturer, storyteller and TV host.

Dreams are for those who are asleep. True illuminates live in the higher worlds, out of the physical body, in a state of intensified wakefulness without ever dreaming.&#x201d;<br><br>Learn the ancient practical methods to awaken consciousness in the world of dreams.<br><br>Scriptures describe how prophets and mystics always acquired wisdom and guidance in dreams. Consciousness in dreams has always been of the utmost spiritual and psychological importance. Astral projection, lucid dreaming, out of body experiences, and vision quests are all part of the extensive science called Dream Yoga, the sacred knowledge of consciously harnessing the power of the dream state.<br><br>This book is a practical guide to lead you towards your own conscious experience of the world of dreams. The time has arrived to abandon theories and beliefs in exchange for personal experience of reality. By awakening consciousness here and now in the physical world, we stop dreaming during the day; subsequently, we stop dreaming at night, and instead, enter the world of dreams with the consciousness awake.<br><br>&#x201c;Whosoever awakens the consciousness stops dreaming. Whosoever awakens the consciousness becomes a competent investigator of the superior worlds.&#x201d; &#x2015;Samael Aun Weor</p><p>Thelema Press is a non-profit incorporation delivering to humanity the Gnostic Works of Samael Aun Weor.The aspirant tries to be conscious of his own dream; hence, he becomes a spectator and actor of a dream with the advantage of being able to abandon the scene at will in order to move freely in the Astral World. Then the aspirant, free of the limitations of the flesh, outside the physical body, will have discarded his old familiar environment and penetrated a universe ruled by different laws. The discipline of the dream state of Tantric Buddhists methodically leads us to the awakening of our Consciousness. Gnostics can awaken to the real state of Illumination only through the understanding and elimination of dreams. Sacred scriptures from Hindustan solemnly assert that the whole world is Brahma&#39;s dream. Having this Hindu postulate as a base, let us emphasize that &#34;when Brahma awakens, his dream ends.&#34; As long as the aspirant does not achieve the radical dissolution, not only of dreams, but of their psychological generators as well, absolute awakening is impossible. The definite awakening of the Consciousness is possible only by means of a radical transformation.</p><h2>Not in Your Lifetime: The Defining Book on the J.F.K.

Her written record of this experience forms the basis for The Cosmic Doctrine.<p>Fortune examines the limbo where Science and Magic interact, where the cosmology of the "Big Bang" and chaos theory run parallel to the evolutionary process. She also illustrates the true nature of Good and Evil, which is generally viewed from an individual's own highly subjective and very personal perspective, and provides further insights into the interaction of the positive and negative polarity within the universal scheme of things. A cryptic warning accompanies these clearly outlined concepts: this book is designed to train the mind rather than inform it. In other words, it is intended to induce in the reader a particular attitude to both the inner and outer world.</p><p>Unpublished until 1949, and then only in a privately printed edition, Fortune and her followers considered the material too dangerous for general release. This revised and definitive edition includes original material left out of previous editions and illuminating diagrams by one of Fortune's closest collaborators.</p><p>Dion Fortune (1891-1946), founder of The Society of the Inner Light, is recognized as one of the most luminous figures of 20th-century esoteric thought.

She was also a member of the Order of the Golden Dawn, whose members included at various times such people as A.E. Waite, Aleister Crowley, and W.B.

Rain pelted the vehicle with such force it sounded like pea gravel striking metal. Peering through the windshield, Isaiah Coulter could barely make out the houses along the tree-lined street. He dreaded the thought of making the fifty-foot sprint to the covered front porch of his parents&#x2019; suburban residence. Not for the first time since this storm had started, he wished he&#x2019;d thought to grab a jacket before leaving home that morning.</p><p>When he pushed open the door of the Hummer, his shirtsleeve grew instantly wet and icy, compliments of the high mountain chill that always descended on Crystal Falls, Oregon, when the autumn sunlight was obscured by clouds. Isaiah clenched his teeth, sprang from the vehicle, and broke into a run even as he slammed the door behind him.</p><p>Water streamed from his face by the time he reached the porch, and dripping shanks of dark brown hair were plastered to his forehead. Swearing under his breath, he raked back the strands with rain-slicked fingers and slapped uselessly at his soaked shirt.</p><p>&#x201c;Mom?&#x201d; he yelled as he opened the front door. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me, Isaiah!&#x201d;</p><p>As he wiped his feet on the entryway rug, Isaiah scanned the tidy living area, barely registering any details because the furniture and decorations were so familiar. On the longest wall, the faces of his brothers and sister as well as his own stared back at him from countless framed photographs, a pictorial record of their lives from infancy to adulthood. The delicious smells of warm apple pie and freshly brewed coffee greeted him as he moved farther into the room.</p><p>&#x201c;In the kitchen, dear heart!&#x201d; Mary Coulter called.</p><p>Following his nose and the sound of her voice, Isaiah stepped into the archway. Standing at the kitchen counter, his mother flashed him a welcoming smile. Her plump cheeks rosy, her dark hair lying in loose curls around her face, she was, in Isaiah&#x2019;s eyes, just as beautiful at almost sixty as she had been twenty years ago.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s my best girl?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Hmph,&#x201d; she responded with a shake of her head. &#x201c;And isn&#x2019;t that a fine kettle of fish? The handsomest of all my sons, and you&#x2019;re still single.&#x201d;</p><p>Isaiah knew very well that he wasn&#x2019;t the handsomest pup in her litter. In truth, he and his brothers were all carbon copies of their dad and looked pretty much the same. As for his being single, he liked it that way. Veterinary medicine was a demanding field, leaving him little time for personal relationships. Someday, when his life grew less hectic, he might consider settling down, but for now he needed to stay focused on his career.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, Mom,&#x201d; he replied in a whiny baritone, his stock response when Mary needled him about getting married.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you &#x2018;ah, Mom&#x2019; me. Just look at you, Isaiah Joel, drenched to the skin and blue around the lips. You need someone with good sense to look after you.&#x201d; She tossed him a hand towel. &#x201c;Mop up as best you can before you make puddles on my floor.&#x201d; She glanced at his boots. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;ve tracked in horse dung, I&#x2019;ll snatch you bald-headed.&#x201d;</p><p>Catching the towel in one fist, Isaiah blotted his face and dried the back of his neck. &#x201c;My boots got pressure-washed coming across the lawn, and I wiped them dry on the rug. As for my lips being blue, that&#x2019;s because it&#x2019;s colder than a well digger&#x2019;s ass out there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your lips are blue because it&#x2019;s October and you aren&#x2019;t wearing a coat. A man with your IQ should know better.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know better. I just forgot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d forget your head if it weren&#x2019;t attached. Absentminded, I guess, always thinking deep thoughts and oblivious to everything else.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was sunny when I left the house this morning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Grab your father&#x2019;s sweatshirt there on the back of the chair and put it on. You&#x2019;ll catch your death, sitting around in that wet thing you&#x2019;re wearing.&#x201d;</p><p>Isaiah did feel cold. He quickly divested himself of the wet garment, plucked a plastic shopping sack from the cloth bag holder hanging on a hook by the kitchen door, and stuffed the shirt inside. A moment later, as he drew his dad&#x2019;s sweatshirt over his head, his mother clucked her tongue, saying, &#x201c;Your ribs are showing, Isaiah Joel. I swear, a high wind would blow you away.&#x201d;</p><p>Isaiah knew very well he wasn&#x2019;t that thin. &#x201c;Ah, Mom.&#x201d;</p><p>Accustomed to Mary&#x2019;s scolding, Isaiah bent to kiss her cheek before taking a chair at the round oak table in one corner of the kitchen. &#x201c;Man, that pie sure does smell good.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Made it especially for you.&#x201d; Mary took two pie plates from the cupboard and set herself to the task of cutting the dessert. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not often anymore that I know ahead of time when you&#x2019;re coming over.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If apple pie is my reward, I&#x2019;ll start calling in advance. It&#x2019;s my favorite.&#x201d;</p><p>Mary smiled. &#x201c;Yes, I know. I&#x2019;m your mother, remember.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks for making me a pie, Mom. That was sweet of you.&#x201d; Isaiah settled back on the chair. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Pop?&#x201d;</p><p>Mary released a shrill little sigh, conveying with a lift of her shoulders that her trials were many as Harv Coulter&#x2019;s wife. &#x201c;He set out early this morning to meet Zeke at Natalie&#x2019;s supper club. Something&#x2019;s gone haywire with the refrigeration system, I think. After that, he was heading out to the Lazy J to help Hank and Jake mend fence line. His back has been giving him fits all week, but do you think he&#x2019;ll take it easy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He enjoys helping at the ranch, Mom. Just because he&#x2019;s retired doesn&#x2019;t mean he has to stop living.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; Mary released another sigh. &#x201c;And Jake and Hank really do need the help right now. With Molly expecting again, and Carly trying to care for a baby so soon after eye surgery, both your brothers are spread mighty thin.&#x201d;</p><p>Isaiah had been so busy that he&#x2019;d nearly forgotten his sister-in-law&#x2019;s corneal surgery. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s Carly doing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; Mary beamed a glad smile as she licked a bit of pie filling from her fingertip. &#x201c;She can see, at any rate. The major problem right now is retraining her thingamajig.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Her visual cortex,&#x201d; Isaiah offered.</p><p>&#x201c;There you go,&#x201d; she agreed with a nod. &#x201c;All those medical terms go in one of my ears and out the other. Hank called last night. He bought some red duct tape and lined the edges of all the steps so Carly can tell where one ends and another starts. She almost fell on the front porch yesterday when she was carrying Hank Junior.&#x201d;</p><p>Isaiah winced. &#x201c;No wonder Hank&#x2019;s taping the steps.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He says it helped.&#x201d; Mary opened another cupboard to get some coffee mugs. &#x201c;With no depth perception, she can&#x2019;t see the stair treads clearly.&#x201d;</p><p>Enjoying the warmth that still radiated from the oven, Isaiah sighed and flexed his shoulders. It was strange, he thought, how quickly he could always relax in his mother&#x2019;s kitchen. He guessed it was because the room was a reflection of the woman herself: small, colorful, busy, and full of love.</p><p>The fact that Mary Coulter loved her children was in evidence everywhere he looked. All available surfaces were crowded with plaster handprints, school portraits, art projects gone yellow with age, and silly stuff that he or his siblings had given her over the years, including a knickknack shelf filled with some old-fashioned power-pole insulators that Isaiah and his twin brother, Tucker, had carted home one long-ago day. Now it appeared that Mary had begun to collect grandchild keepsakes. Jake&#x2019;s son&#x2019;s baby booties were pinned to the ruffled white curtains at the window, and the front of the refrigerator was hidden by his crayon creations, all of which were nothing but scribbles.</p><p>Normally Isaiah disliked clutter, but somehow his mom made it work. The crowded walls and splashes of color were not only pleasing to the eye but also oddly soothing. The tension that had knotted his shoulders all day eased away as he rocked back in the chair. He observed his mother with a faint smile. Even her apron took him back through the years, a white frilly thing with embroidery on the pockets that she&#x2019;d worn for as long as he could remember.</p><p>As always, she chattered nonstop as she worked, launching into a story about some neighbor&#x2019;s granddaughter as she drew a half-gallon of vanilla ice cream from the freezer and rifled through a drawer, looking for the scoop. Isaiah listened with only half an ear, his mind on a cow he&#x2019;d treated that morning.</p><p>&#x201c;Anyway,&#x201d; Mary said as she advanced on the table, &#x201c;the reason I asked you to stop by is because I have an idea I want to run by you.&#x201d;</p><p>Isaiah accepted the plate his mother slid toward him. &#x201c;An idea about what?&#x201d; he asked as he forked up a chunk of juicy fruit and flaky golden crust that dripped with melting ice cream.</p><p>&#x201c;Not what, who,&#x201d; Mary corrected. After filling two mugs with piping-hot coffee, she returned to the table and took a seat across from him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about Laura, the young woman I&#x2019;ve been telling you about.&#x201d;</p><p>Isaiah didn&#x2019;t recall his mother&#x2019;s saying anything about someone named Laura. He sent her a bewildered look.</p><p>Mary huffed in exasperation. &#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t you been listening?&#x201d;</p><p>Isaiah swallowed and nodded. &#x201c;Mostly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mostly?&#x201d;</p><p>He lowered his fork back to the plate. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Mom. I guess I&#x2019;m a little distracted.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What is it this time?&#x201d; Mary asked resignedly. &#x201c;Not another rat fatality, I hope.&#x201d;</p><p>Isaiah winced at the reminder. Two months ago, a new tech had prepped some lady&#x2019;s pet rat for abdominal surgery. After shaving the rodent&#x2019;s belly, she&#x2019;d tried to vacuum up the fur and accidentally sucked up the rat as well. Isaiah had been left to explain the rat&#x2019;s unexpected demise to its owner. It hadn&#x2019;t been one his finest moments as a veterinarian.</p><p>&#x201c;No, not a rat, thank God. A cow this time. Uterine infection. I&#x2019;ve done three flushes and hit her with every antibiotic there is. If this next round doesn&#x2019;t work, I&#x2019;ll have to put her down. The farmer&#x2019;s a young guy with a growing family. He can&#x2019;t afford to lose her.&#x201d;</p><p>Mary reached across the table to push a tendril of hair from Isaiah&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;Oh, sweetie, you worry me so.&#x201d;</p><p>Isaiah caught her wrist to kiss her fingertips. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine, Mom. Just busy, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not fine,&#x201d; she insisted. &#x201c;Just look at you.&#x201d;</p><p>Isaiah glanced down. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve lost weight, for starters, and your hair is so long it&#x2019;s almost to your collar. And where on earth did you find that shirt you were wearing? It looked like you slept in it.&#x201d;</p><p>Isaiah shrugged. &#x201c;It just looked bad because it was wet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wet, my foot it was wrinkled.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I forgot to take it from the dryer, that&#x2019;s all. I shook it out.&#x201d;</p><p>Mary rolled her blue eyes toward the ceiling. &#x201c;And your weight? You can&#x2019;t be eating right. What did you have for breakfast?&#x201d;</p><p>Isaiah tried to recall and couldn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;Yogurt, probably.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Probably?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A dog got run over, Mom. I was in surgery at six forty-five.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you ate no breakfast.&#x201d; Mary nodded sagely. &#x201c;And lunch? Please tell me you had something.&#x201d;</p><p>He&#x2019;d wolfed down a package of Twinkies and a bag of Cheese Nips between ranch calls. &#x201c;I ate while I was driving.&#x201d; He glanced guiltily at his hands, hoping his fingers weren&#x2019;t stained yellow. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing fine. Really.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ha. If ever a man needed a wife to look after him, it&#x2019;s you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are we back to that again?&#x201d; Isaiah chuckled. &#x201c;Let up on me, Mom. Like getting married would solve everything? It&#x2019;s a new generation. Young women today don&#x2019;t stay at home and look after their husbands. They have demanding careers of their own, and that&#x2019;s just as it should be.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There must be a few old-fashioned girls left out there.&#x201d;</p><p>If so, Isaiah hadn&#x2019;t encountered any. Not that he&#x2019;d been looking. &#x201c;Maybe so,&#x201d; he settled for saying, then glanced at his watch. &#x201c;About that idea you wanted to discuss. If we&#x2019;re going to talk, we need to get cracking. I have to be back at the clinic by three.&#x201d;</p><p>Mary took a sip of her coffee. &#x201c;Do you remember my neighbor, Etta Parks?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The old lady two doors down?&#x201d; A fleeting image of a pretty, silver-haired woman passed through Isaiah&#x2019;s mind. &#x201c;Yeah, I remember her.&#x201d;</p><p>Mary smiled. &#x201c;Laura is her granddaughter. She&#x2019;s a lovely, sweet girl. Almost every day she comes by to see Etta while she&#x2019;s out walking the dogs.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dogs? How many does she have?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, they&#x2019;re not actually hers.&#x201d; Mary&#x2019;s blue eyes went misty. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s one of the ways Laura supplements her disability income, by walking people&#x2019;s dogs or caring for them while the owners are on vacation. I think she does other things as well, housework and ironing and such. But it&#x2019;s her knack with animals that made me think of you.&#x201d;</p><p>Isaiah realized that his mother was working her way up to something. He glanced at his watch again. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I&#x2019;m not following. A disability income, did you say?&#x201d;</p><p>Mary filled in the blanks, explaining how Etta&#x2019;s granddaughter had gone swimming with friends five years before and hit her head on a rock when she dove into the river. &#x201c;It left her with brain damage of some kind,&#x201d; she explained.</p><p>Isaiah dimly recalled hearing about that. For a while the young woman had been comatose and not expected to live, if he remembered correctly.</p><p>&#x201c;When Laura awakened after the accident,&#x201d; his mother went on, &#x201c;her whole life had been destroyed. I can&#x2019;t remember now what she did for a living a scientist of some kind, I think. Very good income, lots of travel. Then, in a twinkling, it was all taken from her. Now she lives in an apartment over someone&#x2019;s garage and walks dogs to earn money.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a shame,&#x201d; Isaiah said. And he meant it with all his heart. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just not sure what any of this has to do with me.&#x201d;</p><p>The corners of Mary&#x2019;s mouth tightened. &#x201c;Laura is such a pretty girl, and sweet as can be. Her life would be so much fuller if she had a regular job and could meet people her own age.&#x201d;</p><p>Isaiah shifted uneasily on the chair. &#x201c;I suppose that&#x2019;s true, Mom, but practically speaking, what kind of work can a woman with brain damage do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, you see, that&#x2019;s just the thing.&#x201d; Mary leaned slightly forward, her expression suddenly earnest. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s absolutely wonderful with dogs, Isaiah. It occurred to me the other day that she might make an excellent kennel keeper.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whoa.&#x201d; Isaiah held up a hand. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not suggesting what I think you are. A kennel keeper at our clinic?&#x201d; He shook his head emphatically. &#x201c;Tucker and I are running a veterinary hospital, Mother, not a charity organization. We can&#x2019;t hire someone with brain damage.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But, dear heart, Laura&#x2019;s brain damage isn&#x2019;t that bad. I never even knew something was wrong until Etta mentioned it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, absolutely not. I&#x2019;m sorry, Mom, I really am. I&#x2019;d like to help her out, but there&#x2019;s just no way. Remember the rat? A perfectly normal woman pulled that stunt. Tucker and I have worked hard to get where we are. Our reputations as vets are on the line. We&#x2019;re responsible for the well-being of people&#x2019;s pets and farm animals. We can&#x2019;t have a mentally handicapped woman working at our clinic.&#x201d;</p><p>Mary pursed her lips. Isaiah knew that look. She&#x2019;d used it on him a fair thousand times when he was a kid. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;ll remember, your father and I loaned you boys the start-up capital you needed to open that clinic.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The Story of the Jews Volume Two: Belonging: 1492-1900</h2><p><p><strong>In the second of two volumes of this magnificently illustrated cultural history--the tie-in to the PBS and BBC series The Story of the Jews--Simon Schama details the story of the Jewish people, spanning from their expulsion from Spain in the Inquisition across six hundred years to the present day.</strong><br><br>It is a story like no other: an epic of endurance against destruction, of creativity in the face of oppression, joy amidst grief, the affirmation of life against the steepest of odds.</p><p></p><p>It spans the centuries and the continents--from the Iberian Peninsula and the collapse of &#x201c;the golden age&#x201d; to the shtetls of Russia to the dusty streets of infant Hollywood.

Charles)</h2><p>"The Book of Enoch" is one of the most notable extant apocryphal works of the Bible. Estimated to have been written around 300 BC, this ancient Jewish religious work is ascribed by tradition to Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah. Consisting of five distinct sections, the book begins with the fall of the Watchers, angels who fathered the Nephilim, the offspring of &#x201c;sons of god&#x201d; and the &#x201c;daughters of men.&#x201d; The book follows Enoch as he travels through Heaven and expands more thoroughly, than the Book of Genesis, on the early kingdom of Israel and the events leading up to the great flood of Noah. Many themes common to other Biblical apocalyptic stories can be found here: despair by the godly for their world, a world where goodness did not matter and where evil triumphed and prospered. With evil everywhere around, the Apocalyptists saw no hope for the world as it was, it must be destroyed if the good were ever to triumph.

Charles.</p><p></p><h2>The Jewish State</h2><p><i>"It depends on the Jews themselves whether this political pamphlet remains for the present a political romance. If the present generation is too dull to understand it rightly, a future, finer and better generation will arise to understand it. The Jews who wish for a State shall have it, and they will deserve to have it."</i>&#x2014;Preface<br>Theodor Herzl's passionate advocacy of the founding of a Jewish state grew out of his conviction that Jews would never be assimilated into&nbsp;the populations in which they lived. Born in Budapest, Hungary in 1860, Herzl encountered anti-Semitism when he attended a scientific secondary school. Later, as a newspaper correspondent in Paris, he was shocked and dismayed by the anti-Semitic prejudice surrounding the notorious Dreyfus affair (Herzl said in later years that it was the&nbsp;Dreyfus affair that had made a Zionist out of him). Herzl concluded that the only solution for the majority of Jews would&nbsp;be organized emigration to a state of their own.<br>He discussed the political and historic rationale for such a homeland in this extraordinary and influential book, first published as a pamphlet, <i>Der Judenstaat</i>, in Vienna in 1896. The Jewish question, he wrote, was not a social or religious question but a&nbsp;national question that could be solved&nbsp;only by making it "a political world question to be discussed and settled by the civilized nations of the world in council."

You buy your tickets and concessions, and you walk into the theater. Celluloid images flash at twenty-four frames per second, and the hypnotic sequence of moving pictures coaxes you to suspend disbelief and be entertained by the implausible. Unfortunately, many often suspend their beliefs as well, succumbing to subtle lessons in how to behave, think and even perceive reality. Do you find yourself hoping that a sister will succeed in seducing her sibling's husband, that a thief will get away with his crime, that a serial killer will escape judgment? Do you, too, laugh at the bumbling priest and seethe at the intolerant and abusive evangelist? Do you embrace worldviews that infect your faith and then wonder, after your head is clear, whether your faith can survive the infection? In this thoroughly revised and updated edition of his popular book, Brian Godawa guides you through the place of redemption in film, the tricks screenwriters use to communicate their messages, and the mental and spiritual discipline required for watching movies. <em>Hollywood Worldviews</em> helps you enter a dialogue with Hollywood that leads to a happier ending, one that keeps you aware of your culture and awake to your faith.</p><p>Check out Brian Godawa&#39;s website for more info and links!

He was born in 1920 in Andernach, Germany, to an American soldier father and a German mother, and brought to the United States at the age of two. He was raised in Los Angeles and lived there for over fifty years. He died in San Pedro, California, on March 9, 1994, at the age of seventy-three, shortly after completing his last novel,&nbsp;<em>Pulp</em>.</p><p><strong>Abel Debritto</strong>, a former Fulbright scholar and current Marie Curie fellow, works in the digital humanities. He is the author of&nbsp;<em>Charles Bukowski, King of the Underground</em>, and the editor of the Bukowski collections&nbsp;<em>On Writing</em>,&nbsp;<em>On Cats</em>, and&nbsp;<em>On Love</em>.</p>In a posthumously published poem, Bukowski says he's succeeded "If you read this after I am long dead." By that standard, he is indeed a success: this fifth&#x2014;and purportedly last&#x2014;posthumous book published since his death in 1994 offers his still-large audience more of what made Bukowski (1921&#x2013;1994) and his hard-drinking alter ego Henry Chinaski famous, as chronicled, for example, in the films <i>Barfly</i> and <i>Factotum</i>. Rapid, chatty free verse records his devotion to racehorses, boxing and drinking; his sexual exploits and failures; his contempt for highbrow, hoity-toity literati, and his countervailing yearnings for literary fame. Early on, the poems show unapologetic nostalgia: in "the 1930s," "the landlord/ only got his rent/ when you had/ it." Some of the most memorable poems here record the poet's anxieties and delights while caring for his daughter. The final pages are devoted to fate, last things, old age, mortality and retrospectives on Bukowski's hard-drinking, prolific career: "we were not put here to/ enjoy easy days and/ nights." Bukowski's style did not change in his last years; readers who have already written him off are unlikely to change their minds. Fans, however, may discover one of his strongest, most affecting books. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Although it could be used by anyone, it and the companion instructor&#x2019;s copy (also available on Amazon) were assembled and written with small schools or homeschooling groups in mind. For those without a strong mathematics background, or for those studying Euclid on their own, the author recommends purchasing an instructor&#x2019;s copy, which contains the exact material in the student copy, but with additional notes for teachers, comments on the books, and solutions to selected exercises.</p><p>The work consists of the first six books of the <i>Elements</i>, with the addition of ten sets of exercises (additional proofs) to reinforce concepts. The material has been arranged in such a way as to enable its completion in a school year while assuring that all the basic propositions covered in a standard plane geometry class are included. Some propositions have been omitted, but these have been chosen so that the flow of logic is never interrupted, and all omitted propositions are in Appendix A at the back of the book. There is also an appendix explaining the basics of formal reasoning, including an explanation of the converse and contrapositive of a statement and the concept of an indirect proof. </p><p>This book was not designed for the purist. Although it is pure Euclid and contains all of Books I - VI, it may offend the sensibilities of some who love Euclid (as the assembler/author does) to fail to place each proposition in its proper place in the main body of the text. For anyone not under a time constraint, or anyone moving quickly through the text, the author strongly recommends the inclusion of Book II in the main flow of the course.</p></p><p>Kathryn Goulding has been involved in classical education for many years, having taught mathematics and logic for two classical Christian schools, and serving for ten years on the board of one of them.

But in a war against an enemy armed with the powers of illusion, how do you know who the true enemy is&#x2014;or where he will strike next?</p><p><b>Patricia Briggs</b> is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Mercy Thompson urban fantasy series and the Alpha and Omega novels.<b>Prologue</b><p>The wolf stumbled from the cave, knowing that someone was searching for him and he couldn't protect himself this time. Feverish and ill, his head throbbing so hard that it hurt to move, he couldn't pull his thoughts together.</p><p>After all this time, after all of his preparations, he was going to be brought down by an illness.</p><p>The searcher's tendrils spread out again, brushing across him without recognition or pause. The Northlands were rife with wild magic which is why other magic couldn't work correctly here. The searcher looked for a wizard and would never notice the wolf who concealed the man in its shape unless the fever betrayed him.</p><p>He should lie low, it was the best defense...; but he was so afraid, and his illness clogged his thoughts.</p><p>Death didn't frighten him; he sometimes thought he had come here seeking it. He was more afraid he wouldn't die, afraid of what he would become. Perhaps the one who looked for him was just idly hunting but when he felt a third sweep, he knew it was unlikely. He must have given himself away somehow. He'd always known that he would be found one day. He'd just never thought it would be when he was so weak.</p><p>He fought to blend better with the form he'd taken, to lose himself in the wolf. He succeeded.</p><p>The fourth sizzle of magic, the searcher's magic, was too much for the wolf. The wolf was a simpler creature than the mage who hid within him. If he was frightened, he attacked or ran. There was no one here to attack, so he ran.</p><p>It wasn't until the wolf was tired that he could gather his humanity that was a laugh, <i>his</i> humanity well then, he gathered <i>himself</i> together and stopped running. His ribs ached with the force of his breath and the tough pads of his feet were cut by stones and an occasional crystal of ice from a land where the sun would never completely melt winter's gift. He was shivering though he felt hot, feverish. He was sick.</p><p>He couldn't keep running and it wasn't only the wolf who craved escape because running wasn't escape, not from what he fled.</p><p>He closed his eyes, but that didn't keep his head from throbbing in time with his pounding pulse. If he wasn't going to die out here, he would have to find shelter. Someplace warm, where he could wait and recover. He was lucky he'd come south, and it was high summer. If it had been winter, his only chance would have been to return to the caves he'd run from.</p><p>A pile of leaves under a thicket of aspen caught his attention. If they were deep enough to be dry underneath, they would do for shelter. He headed downhill and started for the trees.</p><p>There was no warning. The ground simply gave out from under him so fast he was lying ten feet down on a pile of rotted stakes before he realized what had happened.</p><p>It was an old pit trap. He started to get up and realized that he hadn't been as lucky as he thought. The stakes had snapped when he hit them, but so had his rear leg.</p><p>Perhaps if he hadn't already been so sick, so tired, he could have done something. He'd long ago learned how to set pain aside while he used his magic. But, though he tried, he couldn't distance himself from it this time, not while his body shivered with fever. Without magic, with a broken leg, he was trapped. The rotting stakes meant no one was watching the pit no one to free him or kill him quickly. So he would die slowly.</p><p>That was all right because he didn't want to be free so much as he didn't want to be caught.</p><p>This was a trap, but it wasn't <i>His</i> trap.</p><p>Perhaps, the wolf thought, as his good legs collapsed again, perhaps it would be good not to run anymore. The ground was cold and wet underneath him, and the flush of heat from fever and the frantic journey drained into the chill of his surroundings. He shivered with cold and pain and waited patiently...; even happily, for death to come and take him.</p><br><p>"If you go to the Northlands in the summer you might avoid snowstorms, but you get mud." Aralorn, Staff Page, Runner, and Scout for the Sixth Field Hundred, kicked a rock, which arced into the air and landed with an unsatisfactory splut just ahead of her on the mucky trail.</p><p>It wasn't a real trail. If it hadn't led from the village directly to the well-used camping spot her unit was currently stopped at, she'd have called it a deer trail and suspected that human feet had never trod it.</p><p>"<i>I</i> could have told them that," she said. "But no one asked me."</p><p>She took another step, and her left boot sank six inches down into a patch that looked just like the bit before it that had held her weight just fine. She pulled her foot out and shook it, trying unsuccessfully to get the thick mud off. When she started walking again, her mud-coated boot weighed twice what her right boot did.</p><p>"I suppose," she said in resigned tones as she squelched along, "training isn't supposed to be fun, and sometimes we have to fight in the mud. But there's mud in warmer places. We could go hunting Uriah in the old Great Swamp. That would be good training and <i>useful</i>, but no one would pay us. Mercenaries can't possibly be useful without someone paying us. So we're stuck literally in the case of our supply wagons practicing maneuvers in the cold mud."</p><p>Her sympathetic audience sighed and butted her with his head. She rubbed her horse's gray cheekbone under the leather straps of his bridle. "I know, Sheen. We could get there in an hour if we hurry but I see no sense in encouraging stupid behavior."</p><p>One of the supply wagons was so bogged down in mud that it had broken an axle when they tried to pull it out. Aralorn had been sent out to the nearest village to have a smith repair the damage because the smith they'd brought with them had broken his arm trying to help get the wagon out.</p><p>That there had <i>been</i> a nearby village was something of a surprise out in the Northlands though they weren't very deep into them. That village had probably been why the mercenary troops had been sent to practice where they were instead of twenty miles east or west.</p><p>The mended axle was tied lengthwise onto the left side of Sheen's saddle, with a weighted bag tied to the opposite stirrup to balance the load. It made riding awkward, which was why Aralorn was walking. Part of the reason, anyway.</p><p>"If we get to camp too early, our glorious and inexperienced captain will be ordering the wagon repaired right away. He'll send us out from a fairly good campsite to march for another few miles until the sun sets and we'll be looking for another reasonable place to camp all night." The captain was a good sort, and would be a fine leader eventually. But right now he was pretty set on proving his mettle and so lost to common sense. He needed to be managed properly by someone with a little more experience.</p><p>"If I don't arrive with the axle until it's dark, then he'll have to wait to move out until dawn," she told Sheen. "With daylight, it won't take long to fix the wagon, and we'll all get a good night's sleep. You and I can trot the last half mile or so, just enough to raise a light sweat and claim it was the smith who took so long."</p><p>Her warhorse jerked his head up abruptly. He snorted, his nostrils fluttering as he sucked air and flattened his ears at whatever his nose was telling him.</p><p>Aralorn thumbed off the thong that kept her sword in its sheath and looked around carefully. It wasn't just a person he'd have alerted her to that with a twitch of his ear.</p><p>The scent of blood might have called her horse's battle training to the fore, she thought, or maybe he sensed some sort of predator. This was the Northlands, after all; there were bear, wolves, and a few other things large enough to cause Sheen's upset.</p><p>The gray stallion whinnied a shrill challenge that was likely to be heard for miles around. She could only hope that her captain didn't hear it. Whatever Sheen sensed, it was in the aspen grove just uphill from where they stood. It was also, apparently, in no hurry to attack them since nothing answered Sheen's call: no return challenge, not even a rustle.</p><p>She could go on past. Likely, if it hadn't come out yet, it wasn't going to. But what was the fun in that?</p><p>She dropped Sheen's reins on the ground. He'd stand until she came back at least until he got hungry. Aralorn drew her knife and crept into the thicket of aspen.</p><br><p>He heard her talking and smelled the horse without moving. He'd heard them come by earlier, too or he thought so anyway. The horse put up a fuss this time because the wind that ruffled the leaves of the aspen would have brought him the wolf's scent.</p><p>He waited for them to leave. Tonight, he thought hopefully. Tonight would be the third night he'd spent here, maybe it would be the last. But part of him knew better, knew just how long it took for a body to die of thirst or of hunger. He was too strong yet. It would be tomorrow, at the soonest.</p><p>He'd distracted himself with the hope of death, and only the sound of the woman's feet told him that she'd approached. He opened his eyes to see a sturdily built woman, plain of face except for her large sea-green eyes, leaning over the edge of the pit. She wore the uniform of the mercenaries, and there were calluses and mud on her hands.</p><p>He didn't want to see her eyes, didn't want to feel interest in her at all. He only wanted her to leave him alone so he could die.</p><p>"Plague them all," she said, her voice tight and angry. Then her voice softened to a croon. "How long have you been here, love?"</p><p>The wolf recognized the threat of the knife she held as she slid down the far side of the pit to stand, one foot on either side of his hips. He growled, rolling off his side in preparation to get up because he'd forgotten he wanted to die. Just for a moment. He shook from exertion, sickness, and from the pain of moving his leg. He lay back down again and flattened his ears.</p><p>"Shh," she crooned, inexplicably sheathing her knife in the face of his aggression. "Not so long as all that, apparently. Now what shall I do about you?"</p><p><i>Go away</i>, he thought. He growled at her with as much threat as he could, feeling his lips peel back from his fangs and the hair rise along his spine.</p><p>The expression on her face was not the one that he'd expected. Certainly not one any sane person would turn on a threatening wolf she was standing over. She should fear him.</p><p>Instead...; "Poor thing," she said in that same crooning tone. "Let's get you out of this, shall we?"</p><p>She dropped her gaze away from his and knelt to examine his hips, humming softly as she moved closer.</p><p>She didn't stink of fear, was all he could think. Everyone feared him. Everyone. Even <i>Him</i>, even the one who searched. She smelled of horse, sweat, and something sweet. No fear.</p><p>He snarled, and she wrapped one hand over his muzzle. Sheer astonishment stopped his growls. Just how stupid was she?</p><p>"Shh." The words blended into the music she was making, and he realized that her humming was pulling magic out of the ground around and beneath them. "Let me look."</p><p>He was as surprised at himself as he was at her when he let her do just that. He could have torn out her throat or broken her neck while she examined every inch of him. But he didn't and he wasn't quite certain why not.</p><p>It wasn't that killing her would bother him. He'd killed a lot of people. But that was before. He didn't want to do that anymore. So perhaps that was part of it.</p><p>He knew she was trying to help him but he didn't want help. He wanted to die.</p><p>Her magic swept over and around him, cushioning him. The wolf whined softly and relaxed, leaving the mage in him fully in charge for the first time since the illness had hit. Maybe even longer ago than that.</p><p>Her magic didn't work on the mage because he knew what it was and, he admitted to himself, because it wasn't coercive magic. He was mage enough to read her intent. She didn't want the wolf to become a lapdog but only to relax.</p><p>But evidently helpful intent wasn't why he didn't kill her. Not the real reason. He hadn't been interested in anything in longer than he could remember, but she made him curious. He'd only ever met a practitioner of green magic, wild magic, once before. They hid from the humans in the land if there were any still left. But here was one wearing the clothes of a mercenary.</p><p>She could pick him up which surprised him because she didn't weigh much more than he did. But she couldn't hoist him high enough to reach the edge of the trap, so she set him down again.</p><p>"Going to need some help," she told him, and clambered to the top. She almost didn't make it out of the pit herself; if it had been round, she wouldn't have.</p><p>When she departed and took her magic with her, it left him bereaved&#x2014;as if someone had covered him with a blanket, then removed it. And only when she left did he realize that her music had deadened his pain and soothed him, despite his being a mage on his guard against it.</p><p>He heard the horse move and the sound of leather and something heavy hitting the ground. The horse approached the pit and stopped.</p><p>When the mercenary who could do green magic hopped back into his almost grave, she had a rope in her hand.</p><p>He waited for the wolf to stir as she tied him in a makeshift harness that somehow managed to brace his bad leg. But the wolf waited as meekly as a lamb while she worked. When he was trussed up to her satisfaction, she climbed back out.</p><p>"Come on, Sheen," she told someone. Possibly, he thought, it was the horse.</p><p>The trip out of the hole was not pleasant. He closed his eyes and let the pain take him where it would. When he lay on the ground at last, she untied him.</p><p>Freed at last, he lay where he had fallen, too weak to run. Maybe too curious as well.</p><br><p><b>Chapter One<br>Four Years Later</b></p><p>Aralorn paced, her heart beating with nervous energy.</p><p>It had seemed like a good idea at the time. She intended to sneak in as a servant she was good at being a servant, and people talked in front of servants as if they weren't there at all. But then there had been that slave girl, freshly sold to the very Geoffrey ae'Magi whose court Aralorn was supposed to infiltrate and observe...;</p><p>Maybe if the slave girl hadn't had the gray-green eyes of the old races, eyes Aralorn shared, she wouldn't have given in to impulse. But it had been easy to free the girl and send her off with connections who would see her safely back to her home proof that though she had lived in Sianim all these years, Aralorn was still Rethian enough to despise slavery. It was even easier to use the magic of her mother's people to rearrange her body and her features to mimic the girl and take her place.</p><p>She hadn't realized that slaves could be locked away until they were needed; she'd assumed she'd have work to do. It was well-known that the Archmage's passions were reserved for magic, and he seldom indulged in more fleshly pleasures. She'd figured that the girl had been purchased to <i>do</i> something not sit locked in a room for weeks.</p><p>Aralorn had been just about ready to escape and try again using a different identity when she'd been brought up to the great hall of the ae'Magi's castle four days ago and put...</p></p><h2>Clinical Psychopharmacology: Principles and Practice</h2><p><em>Clinical Psychopharmacology </em>offers a comprehensive guide to clinical practice that explores two major aspects of the field: the clinical research that exists to guide clinical practice of psychopharmacology, and the application of that knowledge with attention to the individualized aspects of clinical practice.

Within this broader story, the Old Testament presents the specific story of God and God&#x2019;s relationship with Israel as the people called, created, and formed to be God&#x2019;s covenant partner and instrument within creation. </p> <p> The Old Testament begins by introducing God&#x2019;s mission in Genesis. The story opens with the portrait of God&#x2019;s good, intended creation of right-relationships (Gen 1&#x2014;2) and the subsequent distortion of that good creation as a result of humanity&#x2019;s rebellion (Gen 3&#x2014;11). Genesis 12 and following introduce God&#x2019;s commitment to restore creation back to the right-relationships and divine intentions with which it began. Coming out of God&#x2019;s new covenant engagement with creation in Gen 9, this divine purpose begins with the calling of a people (who turn out to be the manifold descendants of Abraham and Sarah) to be God&#x2019;s instrument of blessing for all creation and thus to reverse the curse brought on by sin. The diverse traditions that comprise the remainder of the Pentateuch then combine to portray the creation and formation of Israel as a people prepared to be God&#x2019;s instrument of restoration and blessing. As the subsequent Old Testament books portray Israel&#x2019;s life in the land and journey into and out of exile, the reader encounters complex perspectives on Israel&#x2019;s attempts to understand who God is, who they are as God&#x2019;s people, and how, therefore, they ought to live out their identity as God&#x2019;s people within God&#x2019;s mission in the world. The final prophetic books that conclude the Protestant Old Testament ultimately give the story of God&#x2019;s mission and people an open-ended quality, suggesting that God&#x2019;s mission for God&#x2019;s people continues and leading Christian readers to consider the New Testament&#x2019;s story of the Church as an extension and expansion of the broader story of God introduced in the Old Testament.</p> <p> The main methodological perspective that informs the book includes work on the phenomenological function of narrative (especially story&#x2019;s function to shape the identity and practice of the reader), as well as more recent so-called &#x201c;missional&#x201d; approaches to reading Christian scripture.

In this delightful romance about the man too self-centered to fall in love and the woman too unsure of herself to want more out of life than the little she already has, George Bernard Shaw shakes the dust off the Cinderella story and tells it as only he can. Eliza Doolittle, the Cockney flower girl who wants to work in a flower shop, and Henry Higgins, the phoneticist who turns her into a <i>princess,</i> are no mythological knight and maiden. Instead, even today, they resound with sharp humor and cutting dialogue. Originally published in 1914, <i>Pygmalion</i> invites readers and audience members to examine the roots of social prejudice and the true value of a human being, while also involving them in the improbable lives of Shaw's one-dimensional, yet endearing characters. <p><b>From the Publisher</b></p><p><i>Pygmalion</i> was originally a play written for the stage by George Bernard Shaw in 1913. It was a typical five-act play: Act I taking place in the street outside of Covent Garden Theater; Act II taking place in the library of Henry Higgins s home on Wimpole Street. Act III takes place in the drawing room of Higgins s mother at her at-home. Act IV returns to Higgins s home, and Act V returns to Mrs. Higgins s drawing room. There are, in all, three sets: the London street, Higgins s library, and Mrs. Higgins s drawing room. </p><p>The 1913 stage play is the version reproduced in the <i>Prestwick House Literary Touchstone.</i> </p><p>It is interesting to note that, after theater audiences and critics complained about the ambiguous ending of the 1913 stage play and the apparent lack of a happy ending, Shaw wrote an epilogue, which is included in the Touchstone edition. In this epilogue, Shaw narrates the events of the years following the close of the play. Eliza marries Freddy. He drops the Eynsford from his name and with financial assistance from Colonel Pickering opens a green-grocer shop. Eliza, also with Pickering s help, opens a florist shop next door to Freddy. The couple remains close friends with the Colonel and Higgins, neither of whom ever marry. </p><p>In 1938, Shaw adapted his stage play for the screen. This film version of <i>Pygmalion</i> starred Leslie Howard as Higgins and Wendy Hiller as Eliza. There are several notable differences between the 1913 stage play and the 1938 screenplay. While the stage play has a decidedly Victorian flavor, the screen play is definitely twentieth-century. Whereas in the stage play, Higgins and Pickering intend to take Eliza to an ambassador s garden party, in the screenplay, they take her to an embassy ball. </p><p>The movie also presents the scene of Eliza s triumph at the ball, which the play does not. To do so in the play would have required an additional set change, costume changes, and a host of stage extras, all of which Shaw and his producer apparently deemed unnecessary. </p><p>Probably the most significant difference between the 1913 stage play and the 1938 screen play, however, is the ending. Shaw s epilogue must not have satisfied the public, as, at the end of the 1938 movie, Eliza returns to Higgins. </p><p>It is the 1938 screenplay that served as the basis for the 1956 stage musical and the 1964 movie musical, My Fair Lady. Again, however, there were significant changes. The visit to Mrs. Higgins s home in Act III becomes a visit to the Ascot Racecourse. The role of Eliza s father and his marriage in Act V are greatly expanded. How Eliza spends the night after the embassy ball is expanded, and so on.</p></p><p></p><h2>The View from Somewhere: Undoing the Myth of Journalistic Objectivity</h2><p>#MeToo. #BlackLivesMatter. #NeverAgain. #WontBeErased. Though both the right- and left-wing media claim &#x201c;objectivity&#x201d; in their reporting of these and other contentious issues, the American public has become increasingly cynical about truth, fact, and reality. In <i>The View from Somewhere</i>, Lewis Raven Wallace dives deep into the history of &#x201c;objectivity&#x201d; in journalism and how its been used to gatekeep and silence marginalized writers as far back as Ida B. Wells.<br> &nbsp;<br> At its core, this is a book about fierce journalists who have pursued truth and transparency and sometimes been punished for it&#x2014;not just by tyrannical governments but by journalistic institutions themselves. He highlights the stories of journalists who question &#x201c;objectivity&#x201d; with sensitivity and passion: Desmond Cole of the <i>Toronto Star</i>; <i>New York Times </i>reporter Linda Greenhouse; Pulitzer Prize-winner Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah; Peabody-winning podcaster John Biewen; <i>Guardian </i>correspondent Gary Younge; former <i>Buzzfeed </i>reporter Meredith Talusan; and many others. Wallace also shares his own experiences as a midwestern transgender journalist and activist who was fired from his job as a national reporter for public radio for speaking out against &#x201c;objectivity&#x201d; in coverage of Trump and white supremacy.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> With insightful steps through history, Wallace stresses that journalists have never been mere passive observers&#x2014;the choices they make reflect worldviews tinted by race, class, gender, and geography. He upholds the centrality of facts and the necessary discipline of verification but argues against the long-held standard of &#x201c;objective&#x201d; media coverage that asks journalists to claim they are without bias. Using historical and contemporary examples&#x2014;from lynching in the nineteenth century to transgender issues in the twenty-first&#x2014;Wallace offers a definitive critique of &#x201c;objectivity&#x201d; as a catchall for accurate journalism. He calls for the dismissal of this damaging mythology in order to confront the realities of institutional power, racism, and other forms of oppression and exploitation in the news industry.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now more than ever, journalism that resists extractive, exploitive, and tokenistic practices toward&nbsp;marginalized people isn&#x2019;t just important&#x2014;it is essential. Combining Wallace&#x2019;s intellectual and emotional journey with the wisdom of others&#x2019; experiences, <i>The View from Somewhere</i> is a compelling rallying cry against journalist neutrality and for the validity of news told from distinctly subjective voices. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Lewis Raven Wallace</b>&nbsp;is an independent journalist, a co-founder of Press On, a southern movement journalism collective, and the host of&nbsp;<i>The View from Somewhere&nbsp;</i>podcast. He previously worked in public radio and is a longtime activist engaged in prison abolition, racial justice, and queer and trans liberation. He is a white transgender person from the Midwest and is now based in North Carolina.&#x201c;Nuanced and subtle. . . A compelling addition to the ongoing conversation on journalism and how it is practiced and consumed.&#x201d; (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>"[A]&nbsp;thoughtfully researched series of essays. . . .&nbsp;Wallace makes his case by carefully tracing the history of so-called objectivity in journalism. . . . As his story moves into the present, [he] persuasively argues that collective action can remedy traditional reporting&#x2019;s blind spots." (<i>Bookforum</i>)<br><br>"An outstanding and urgently needed critique of journalistic orthodoxy. . . Ought to be required reading in journalism schools everywhere." (<i>PopMatters</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Wallace dissects modern definitions of &#x2018;neutrality&#x2019; in news and points to journalism&#x2019;s historic trailblazers&#x2014;queer, Black, and immigrant reporters&#x2014;to remind us how marginalized people have suffered at the hands of so-called &#x2018;objective news&#x2019; and how we must urgently resist and reframe those definitions. An essential book for reporters, editors, and consumers of news.&#x201d; (<i>Seema Yasmin, Emmy Award&#x2013;winning journalist, medical doctor, and Stanford University professor</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>The View From Somewhere</i> is brilliant. Wallace slays the myth of journalistic objectivity, forcing the reader to wrestle with something profound: that all readers and creators of journalism have subjectivities, and that we can better perceive and create depictions of truth if we all examine these subjectivities instead of pretending that they don&#x2019;t exist.&#x201d; (<i>Steven Thrasher, journalist and Northwestern University professor</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Wallace asks the right questions and makes a powerful case for a reexamination of what journalism is and how it can best serve the public. American journalists will readily admit, I think, that our industry has let down the broader community in recent&nbsp;years. Wallace posits a new solution for how we might avoid the mistakes of the past and move forward in a productive way. <i>The View from Somewhere</i> is both a fascinating dissection of our political body and a passionate plea for reform. It's also a darn good read.&#x201d; (<i>Celeste Headlee, author of We Need to Talk: How to Have Conversations That Matter</i>)</p><h2>Camino Portugu�s Maps: Lisbon - Porto - Santiago / Camino Central, Camino de la Costa, Variente Espiritual &amp; Senda Litoral (Camino Guides) (English and Portuguese Edition)</h2><p><p><b>2020 edition</b></p> <p>Spiritual seekers and travelers will find all the resources they need to walk the Way of St. James in this complete set of maps and town plans covering the sacred route from Lisbon, via Porto, to Santiago de Compostella, including the alternate coastal route.

Merry is the daughter of the local police chief and granddaughter of his predecessor; her father is a strict boss and Merry feels pressure to go the extra mile to prove her promotion to detective isn&#x2019;t just nepotism. But the Mason murder is a demanding first test. Merry&#x2019;s investigation brings to light all the tensions that plague the tiny community of Nantucket: the decades-old grudges, the skyrocketing real estate that only wealthy weekenders can afford, the resentments of the old Nantucket families who are barely keeping their homes and heritage fishing businesses alive.

Being a good preacher requires learning the mental, emotional, spiritual and physical skills needed to effectively share God's word with a congregation. It demands a commitment to the craft of preaching. But few pastors feel adequately prepared for this high-stakes responsibility when they begin their ministries. Mary Hulst knows what it takes to preach well. Forged by her experiences as a pastor, preaching professor and college chaplain, she recognizes the challenges of the pulpit. In this uniquely practical book, Hulst provides foundational concepts and tips that all pastors can use, whether they are ministry newcomers or seasoned professionals. Preaching can bring both you and your congregation great joy and satisfaction, week after week. And <em>A Little Handbook for Preachers</em> can help you deliver a better sermon by Sunday.</p><p>Mary S. Hulst (MDiv, Calvin Theological Seminary; PhD, University of Illinois) is the college chaplain at Calvin College. She previously served as a professor of preaching at Calvin Theological Seminary and as senior pastor of Eastern Avenue Christian Reformed Church. She lives in Grand Rapids, Michigan, with her husband, Andrew Kromminga."Mary Hulst writes with great authority and verve. Her writing is balanced and mature but also fresh. I can't imagine a preacher who would not be blessed by her work." (Cornelius Plantinga Jr., author of Reading for Preaching)<br><br>"Three words came to mind as I read this book: <em>honest</em>, <em>practical</em> and <em>personal</em>. <em>Honest</em> because this little gem of a book reminds those of us who have been preaching a while as well as those new to preaching that we can improve our preaching. Many of us will find ourselves in the stories she shares about preaching gone wrong. <em>Practical</em> because Mary doesn't just tell us that we could be doing better, she shares with us how we can improve. She guides us through small steps that will yield big dividends. And <em>Personal</em> because, as someone who knows Mary, preaching matters to her and she is good at it. I can hear her voice as I read through the pages. The words on these pages are from a person who cares deeply about the Word and who cares about those who proclaim it. This book is a must-have for anyone who proclaims the gospel." (Michelle R. Loyd-Paige, Dean of Multi-Cultural Affairs, Calvin College and president of Preach Sista!)<br><br>"Mary Hulst has the rare gift of not only being an extremely effective preacher, but also an extremely effective teacher of preaching. One particular virtue of this book is the way that it integrates excellence in biblical exegesis, theological interpretation, pastoral discernment, communication skills and interpersonal intelligence into one seamless vision. As a result, the book helps us envision how the highest ideals for ministry can be practiced in a realistic and sustainable way of life. This book promises to inspire both rookie and veteran preachers for seasons of vital and faithful ministry." (John D. Witvliet, Calvin Institute of Christian Worship, Calvin College and Calvin Theological Seminary)<br><br>"There are multitudes of thick, heavy books on the theology and philosophy of preaching. There are multitudes of preachers trying to get into their pulpit with a sermon every week. In this book, Mary Hulst has distilled theology and philosophy into a field guide for active-duty preachers. Relatively new preachers will find courage and thoughtful answers to the questions no one bothered to ask or answer in seminary (where do I hook my mic pack if I'm wearing a dress?). Seasoned preachers will find a fresh take on their work and encouragement to try something new or to return to their first love&#x2015;telling the old, old story again and again." (Meg Jenista, pastor, Washington, DC Christian Reformed Church)<br><br>"<em>A Little Handbook for Preachers</em> is an outstanding resource for those called to preach the gospel today. Much like the author and her sermons, the book is clear, insightful and inspired. Mary S. Hulst provides the essential principles for biblical preaching and offers practical and poignant advice on how to prepare a sermon that connects with the changing landscape of listeners in our churches today." (Josiah Chung, pastor, Living Water CRC, Grand Rapids, MI)<br><br>"A wholly approachable and practical guide for those who take the call to preach seriously. Mary does not leave us full of shame for not preparing 'her way' but instead offers us a wealth of information, examples, stories and suggestions to encourage us to dig for the ways God will meet us as we go about the task of preaching. With each chapter, Mary reminds us of our own capacity for creativity and the possibility for connection&#x2015;with God and those who will be moved by our words." (Austin Channing Brown, writer and speaker)<br><br>"<em>A Little Handbook for Preachers</em> is a great resource for pastors who want to work on their preaching, for a group of preachers to study together, and for other church leaders who simply want a better idea of what goes into preaching God's Word faithfully and fully. Thank you, Pastor Mary, for serving up such a good meal for the church today." (Chris Schoon, Reformed Worship, September 14, 2016)<br><br>"Why would anyone other than a preacher read a handbook for preachers? While this book is packed with clear, practical encouragement and suggestions for preachers, it also offers a quick educational course for those in the pews. . . . This is a great resource for worship committees and councils, especially as they seek to support those who stand behind the pulpit each Sunday." (Kristy Quist, Banner, June 3, 2016)<br><br>"Mary Hulst knows what it takes to preach well. Forged by her experiences as a pastor, preaching professor and college chaplain, she recognizes the challenges of the pulpit. In this uniquely practical book, Hulst provides foundational concepts and tips that pastors can use, whether they are ministry newcomers or seasoned professionals." (The Light, May 2016)<br><br>"I love the hard-hitting, practical, encouraging way that Hulst presents the preaching task! She has certainly done the world of preachers a great service."

As an informal confidant of Sir Robert Cecil, adviser to King James I, he witnesses the making of history, from the Gunpowder Plot to the accession of King Charles I and the growing animosity between Parliament and court. <br><br>Tradescant&#x2019;s talents soon come to the attention of the most powerful man in the country, the irresistible Duke of Buckingham, the lover of King Charles I. Tradescant has always been faithful to his masters, but Buckingham is unlike any he has ever known: flamboyant, outrageously charming, and utterly reckless. Every certainty upon which Tradescant has based his life&#x2014;his love of his wife and children, his passion for his work, his loyalty to his country&#x2014;is shattered as he follows Buckingham to court, to war, and to the forbidden territories of human love.</p><p>Philippa Gregory is the author of many <i>New York Times</i> bestselling novels, including&nbsp;<i>The Other Boleyn Girl</i>, and is a recognized authority on women&#x2019;s history.

She welcomes visitors to her website PhilippaGregory.com.Seventeenth-century England is the setting for this engaging historical novel based on the life of John Tradescant, a gardener of common birth who transforms plain plots of land into slices of heaven on earth. As vassal to the secretary of state, Sir Robert Cecil, Tradescant&#x2014;who, as fate would have it, had no sense of smell&#x2014;places his master's garden above all else, much to the chagrin of his wife, Elizabeth, and young son, J. Tradescant's affinity for botanicals is matched by his thirst for adventure; in the service of his lord, he travels to distant lands to defend his country's honor (and collect cuttings of rare and exotic plants). When Tradescant is summoned by King James I's closest confidante, the dark-haired and devious Duke of Buckingham, he is immediately taken by the nobleman's beauty. Devotion soon turns to erotic obsession, and Tradescant must face the consequences of loving a fickle, heartless man. Gregory (<i>The Virgin's Lover</i>; <i>The Other Boleyn Girl</i>) renders lush details of plants and clever commentary on the passions and power plays of the British royal court. Only the occasional detail-heavy battle scene slows this vibrant tale of a man grappling with the liabilities of loyalty and love. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Writers&#39; Lab over the course of ten years and has helped hundreds of screenwriters complete their work. Many graduates of the Lab have gone on to illustrious careers as screenwriters and producers in TV and film. The 90-Day Screenplay method of structuring your story is organic, involving a rigorous inquiry into the dilemma besetting your characters. This inside-out approach avoids the distractions that frequently occur when one&#39;s focus is placed squarely on plot. Screenwriting is often taught by Hollywood story analysts who confuse story structure with &#34;plotting,&#34; thus leading to a formulaic, one-size-fits-all style of writing. By focusing on the dilemma besetting your characters, and by exploring the resolution to this dilemma, the plot emerges naturally in surprising and dynamic ways. The 90-Day Screenplay will guide you through the process of outlining your screenplay, writing a first draft, and completing a rewrite, all in three months. In this day-by-day guide you will: * Uncover the dilemma at the heart of your screenplay * Learn how to write from your subconscious * Rewrite your work efficiently * Discover your story&#39;s structure as an experiential model * Develop a process of getting the story from your imagination to the page</p><p>"<i>The 90-day Screenplay</i>&nbsp;is not just for writers, but for producers who want to know how their "product" is made." &nbsp;<br><b>- David Streit (co-producer of&nbsp;<i>Internal Affairs</i>,&nbsp;<i>River's Edge</i>)</b><br><b></b>&nbsp;<br>"<i>The 90-Day Screenplay</i>&nbsp;digs straight for the substratum of drama by asking the question: why is dramatic form universal and how is it a reflection of human experience?

Charles Gatewood &amp; His Apache Wars Memoir</h2><p>Lt. Charles B. Gatewood (1853&#x2013;96), an educated Virginian, served in the Sixth U.S. Cavalry as the commander of Indian scouts. Gatewood was largely accepted by the Native peoples with whom he worked because of his efforts to understand their cultures. It was precisely this connection between Gatewood and the Indians, and with Geronimo and Naiche in particular, that led to his involvement in the last Apache war and his work for Indian rights.<br>Realizing that he had more experience dealing with Native peoples than other lieutenants serving on the frontier, Gatewood decided to record his experiences. Although he died before he completed his project, <i>Lt. Charles Gatewood &amp; His Apache Wars Memoir</i> is an important firsthand account of Gatewood&#x2019;s life as a commander of Apache scouts and as a military commandant of the White Mountain Indian Reservation. Louis Kraft presents Gatewood&#x2019;s previously unpublished account, complementing it with an introduction, additional text that fills in the gaps in Gatewood&#x2019;s narrative, detailed notes, and an epilogue. Kraft&#x2019;s work offers new background information on Gatewood and throws the manuscript into new relief as a fresh account of how Gatewood viewed the events in which he took part.</p><p>Louis Kraft, an independent scholar, is the author of <i>Gatewood &amp; Geronimo</i> and <i>Custer and the Cheyenne: George Armstrong Custer&#x2019;s Winter Campaign on the Southern Plains</i>.&#x201c;The memoir is a fascinating read. To fill in missing details, Kraft has provided excellent commentary and footnotes. Readers will find invaluable Lt. Gatewood&#x2019;s accounts of his service as chief of Apache scouts, commander of the White Mountain Apache Reservation, and later aide-de-camp to General Nelson Miles. . . . A welcome addition to the literature of the frontier army and Apache relations. . . .

The shape of<br>it, to begin with. The very first time I saw her, it was the back of the<br>head I saw, and there was something lovely about it, the angles of it.<br>Like a shiny, hard corn kernel or a riverbed fossil. She had what the<br>Victorians would call <i>finely shaped head. </i>You could imagine the<br>skull quite easily.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;d know her head anywhere.<br>&nbsp;<br>And what&#x2019;s inside it. I think of that too: her mind. Her brain, all<br>those coils, and her thoughts shuttling through those coils like fast,<br>frantic centipedes. Like a child, I picture opening her skull, unspooling<br>her brain and sifting through it, trying to catch and pin down<br>her thoughts. <i>What are you thinking, Amy? </i>The question I&#x2019;ve asked<br>most often during our marriage, if not out loud, if not to the person<br>who could answer. I suppose these questions stormcloud over every<br>marriage: <i>What are you thinking? How are you feeling? Who are</i><br><i>you? What have we done to each other? What will we do?</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>My eyes flipped open at exactly six a.m. This was no avian fluttering<br>of the lashes, no gentle blink toward consciousness. The awakening<br>was mechanical. A spooky ventriloquist- dummy click of the lids:<br>The world is black and then, <i>showtime! </i>6- 0- 0 the clock said&#x2014; in my<br>face, first thing I saw. 6- 0- 0. It felt different. I rarely woke at such a<br>rounded time. I was a man of jagged risings: 8:43, 11:51, 9:26. My<br>life was alarmless.<br>&nbsp;<br>At that exact moment, 6- 0- 0, the sun climbed over the skyline of<br>oaks, revealing its full summer angry- god self. Its reflection flared<br>across the river toward our house, a long, blaring finger aimed at me<br>through our frail bedroom curtains. Accusing: <i>You have been seen.</i><br><i>You will be seen.</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>I wallowed in bed, which was our New York bed in our new house,<br>which we still called <i>the new house, </i>even though we&#x2019;d been back here<br>for two years. It&#x2019;s a rented house right along the Mississippi River,<br>a house that screams Suburban Nouveau Riche, the kind of place<br>I aspired to as a kid from my split- level, shag- carpet side of town.<br>The kind of house that is immediately familiar: a generically grand,<br>unchallenging, new, new, new house that my wife would&#x2014; and did&#x2014;<br>detest.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Should I remove my soul before I come inside?&#x201d; Her first line upon<br>arrival. It had been a compromise: Amy demanded we rent, not buy,<br>in my little Missouri hometown, in her firm hope that we wouldn&#x2019;t<br>be stuck here long. But the only houses for rent were clustered in<br>this failed development: a miniature ghost town of bank- owned,<br>recession- busted, price- reduced mansions, a neighborhood that closed<br>before it ever opened. It was a compromise, but Amy didn&#x2019;t see it that<br>way, not in the least. To Amy, it was a punishing whim on my part, a<br>nasty, selfish twist of the knife. I would drag her, caveman- style, to a<br>town she had aggressively avoided, and make her live in the kind of<br>house she used to mock. I suppose it&#x2019;s not a compromise if only one of<br>you considers it such, but that was what our compromises tended to<br>look like. One of us was always angry. Amy, usually.<br>&nbsp;<br>Do not blame me for this particular grievance, Amy. The Missouri<br>Grievance. Blame the economy, blame bad luck, blame my parents,<br>blame your parents, blame the Internet, blame people who use the<br>Internet. I used to be a writer. I was a writer who wrote about TV<br>and movies and books. Back when people read things on paper, back<br>when anyone cared about what I thought. I&#x2019;d arrived in New York in<br>the late &#x2019;90s, the last gasp of the glory days, although no one knew it<br>then. New York was packed with writers, real writers, because there<br>were magazines, real magazines, loads of them. This was back when<br>the Internet was still some exotic pet kept in the corner of the publishing<br>world&#x2014; throw some kibble at it, watch it dance on its little leash,<br>oh quite cute, it definitely won&#x2019;t kill us in the night. Think about it: a<br>time when newly graduated college kids could come to New York and<br><i>get paid to write. </i>We had no clue that we were embarking on careers<br>that would vanish within a decade.<br>&nbsp;<br>I had a job for eleven years and then I didn&#x2019;t, it was that fast. All<br>around the country, magazines began shuttering, succumbing to<br>a sudden infection brought on by the busted economy. Writers (my<br>kind of writers: aspiring novelists, ruminative thinkers, people whose<br>brains don&#x2019;t work quick enough to blog or link or tweet, basically old,<br>stubborn blowhards) were through. We were like women&#x2019;s hat makers<br>or buggy- whip manufacturers: Our time was done. Three weeks after<br>I got cut loose, Amy lost her job, such as it was. (Now I can feel Amy<br>looking over my shoulder, smirking at the time I&#x2019;ve spent discussing<br>my career, my misfortune, and dismissing her experience in one sentence.<br>That, she would tell you, is typical. <i>Just like Nick, </i>she would<br>say. It was a refrain of hers: <i>Just like Nick to . . . </i>whatever followed,<br>whatever was <i>just like me, </i>was bad.) Two jobless grown- ups, we spent<br>weeks wandering around our Brooklyn brownstone in socks and pajamas,<br>ignoring the future, strewing unopened mail across tables and<br>sofas, eating ice cream at ten a.m. and taking thick afternoon naps.<br>&nbsp;<br>Then one day the phone rang. My twin sister was on the other<br>end. Margo had moved back home after her own New York layoff<br>a year before&#x2014; the girl is one step ahead of me in everything, even<br>shitty luck. Margo, calling from good ole North Carthage, Missouri,<br>from the house where we grew up, and as I listened to her voice, I<br>saw her at age ten, with a dark cap of hair and overall shorts, sitting<br>on our grandparents&#x2019; back dock, her body slouched over like an old<br>pillow, her skinny legs dangling in the water, watching the river fl ow<br>over fish- white feet, so intently, utterly self- possessed even as a child.<br>Go&#x2019;s voice was warm and crinkly even as she gave this cold news:<br>Our indomitable mother was dying. Our dad was nearly gone&#x2014; his<br>(nasty) mind, his (miserable) heart, both murky as he meandered<br>toward the great gray beyond. But it looked like our mother would<br>beat him there. About six months, maybe a year, she had. I could tell<br>that Go had gone to meet with the doctor by herself, taken her studious<br>notes in her slovenly handwriting, and she was teary as she tried<br>to decipher what she&#x2019;d written. Dates and doses.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, fuck, I have no idea what this says, is it a nine? Does that<br>even make sense?&#x201d; she said, and I interrupted. Here was a task, a<br>purpose, held out on my sister&#x2019;s palm like a plum. I almost cried with<br>relief.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come back, Go. We&#x2019;ll move back home. You shouldn&#x2019;t have to<br>do this all by yourself.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She didn&#x2019;t believe me. I could hear her breathing on the other end.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious, Go. Why not? There&#x2019;s nothing here.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>A long exhale. &#x201c;What about Amy?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>That is what I didn&#x2019;t take long enough to consider. I simply assumed<br>I would bundle up my New York wife with her New York interests,<br>her New York pride, and remove her from her New York parents&#x2014;<br>leave the frantic, thrilling futureland of Manhattan behind&#x2014; and<br>transplant her to a little town on the river in Missouri, and all would<br>be fine.<br>&nbsp;<br>I did not yet understand how foolish, how optimistic, how, yes,<br><i>just like Nick </i>I was for thinking this. The misery it would lead to.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Amy will be fine. Amy . . .&#x201d; Here was where I should have said,<br>&#x201c;Amy <i>loves </i>Mom.&#x201d; But I couldn&#x2019;t tell Go that Amy loved our mother,<br>because after all that time, Amy still barely knew our mother. Their<br>few meetings had left them both baffled. Amy would dissect the conversations<br>for days after&#x2014;&#x201c;And what did she mean by . . . ,&#x201d; as if my<br>mother were some ancient peasant tribeswoman arriving from the<br>tundra with an armful of raw yak meat and some buttons for bartering,<br>trying to get something from Amy that wasn&#x2019;t on offer.<br>&nbsp;<br>Amy didn&#x2019;t care to know my family, didn&#x2019;t want to know my<br>birthplace, and yet for some reason, I thought moving home would<br>be a good idea.<br>&nbsp;<br>My morning breath warmed the pillow, and I changed the subject in<br>my mind. Today was not a day for second- guessing or regret, it was a<br>day for doing. Downstairs, I could hear the return of a long- lost sound:<br>Amy making breakfast. Banging wooden cupboards (rump- thump!),<br>rattling containers of tin and glass (ding- ring!), shuffling and sorting<br>a collection of metal pots and iron pans (ruzz-shuzz!). A culinary<br>orchestra tuning up, clattering vigorously toward the finale, a cake<br>pan drumrolling along the floor, hitting the wall with a cymballic<br>crash. Something impressive was being created, probably a crepe,<br>because crepes are special, and today Amy would want to cook something<br>special.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was our five- year anniversary.<br>&nbsp;<br>I walked barefoot to the edge of the steps and stood listening,<br>working my toes into the plush wall- to- wall carpet Amy detested on<br>principle, as I tried to decide whether I was ready to join my wife.<br>Amy was in the kitchen, oblivious to my hesitation. She was humming<br>something melancholy and familiar. I strained to make it out&#x2014; a folk<br>song? a lullabye?&#x2014;and then realized it was the theme to <i>M*A*S*H.</i><br>Suicide is painless. I went downstairs.<br>&nbsp;<br>I hovered in the doorway, watching my wife. Her yellow- butter<br>hair was pulled up, the hank of ponytail swinging cheerful as a jumprope,<br>and she was sucking distractedly on a burnt fingertip, humming<br>around it. She hummed to herself because she was an unrivaled<br>botcher of lyrics. When we were first dating, a Genesis song came on<br>the radio: &#x201c;She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah.&#x201d; And Amy<br>crooned instead, &#x201c;She takes my hat and puts it on the top shelf.&#x201d;<br>When I asked her why she&#x2019;d ever think her lyrics were remotely, possibly,<br>vaguely right, she told me she always thought the woman in the<br>song truly loved the man because she put his hat on the <i>top </i>shelf. I<br>knew I liked her then, really liked her, this girl with an explanation<br>for everything.<br>&nbsp;<br>There&#x2019;s something disturbing about recalling a warm memory and<br>feeling utterly cold.<br>&nbsp;<br>Amy peered at the crepe sizzling in the pan and licked something<br>off her wrist. She looked triumphant, wifely. If I took her in my arms,<br>she would smell like berries and powdered sugar.<br>&nbsp;<br>When she spied me lurking there in grubby boxers, my hair in full<br>Heat Miser spike, she leaned against the kitchen counter and said,<br>&#x201c;Well, hello, handsome.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Bile and dread inched up my throat. I thought to myself: <i>Okay, go.</i><br>I was very late getting to work. My sister and I had done a foolish<br>thing when we both moved back home. We had done what we always<br>talked about doing. We opened a bar. We borrowed money from Amy<br>to do this, eighty thousand dollars, which was once nothing to Amy<br>but by then was almost everything. I swore I would pay her back,<br>with interest. I would not be a man who borrowed from his wife&#x2014; I<br>could feel my dad twisting his lips at the very idea. <i>Well, there are all</i><br><i>kinds of men, </i>his most damning phrase, the second half left unsaid,<br><i>and you are the wrong kind.</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>But truly, it was a practical decision, a smart business move. Amy<br>and I both needed new careers; this would be mine. She would pick<br>one someday, or not, but in the meantime, here was an income, made<br>possible by the last of Amy&#x2019;s trust fund. Like the McMansion I rented,<br>the bar featured symbolically in my childhood memories&#x2014; a place<br>where only grown- ups go, and do whatever grown- ups do. Maybe<br>that&#x2019;s why I was so insistent on buying it after being stripped of my<br>livelihood. It&#x2019;s a reminder that I am, after all, an adult, a grown man,<br>a useful human being, even though I lost the career that made me<br>all these things. I won&#x2019;t make that mistake again: The once plentiful<br>herds of magazine writers would continue to be culled&#x2014; by the<br>Internet, by the recession, by the American public, who would rather<br>watch TV or play video games or electronically inform friends that,<br>like, <i>rain sucks! </i>But there&#x2019;s no app for a bourbon buzz on a warm day<br>in a cool, dark bar. The world will always want a drink.<br>&nbsp;<br>Our bar is a corner bar with a haphazard, patchwork aesthetic. Its<br>best feature is a massive Victorian back bar, dragon heads and angel<br>faces emerging from the oak&#x2014; an extravagant work of wood in these<br>shitty plastic days. The remainder of the bar is, in fact, shitty, a showcase<br>of the shabbiest design offerings of every decade: an Eisenhowerera<br>linoleum floor, the edges turned up like burnt toast; dubious<br>wood- paneled walls straight from a &#x2019;70s home- porn video; halogen<br>floor lamps, an accidental tribute to my 1990s dorm room. The ultimate<br>effect is strangely homey&#x2014; it looks less like a bar than someone&#x2019;s<br>benignly neglected fixer- upper. And jovial: We share a parking<br>lot with the local bowling alley, and when our door swings wide, the<br>clatter of strikes applauds the customer&#x2019;s entrance.<br>&nbsp;<br>We named the bar The Bar. &#x201c;People will think we&#x2019;re ironic instead<br>of creatively bankrupt,&#x201d; my sister reasoned.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yes, we thought we were being clever New Yorkers&#x2014; that the<br>name was a joke no one else would really get, not get like we did.<br>Not <i>meta</i>- get. We pictured the locals scrunching their noses: Why&#x2019;d<br>you name it <i>The Bar</i>? But our first customer, a gray- haired woman in<br>bifocals and a pink jogging suit, said, &#x201c;I like the name. Like in <i>Breakfast</i><br><i>at Tiffany&#x2019;s </i>and Audrey Hepburn&#x2019;s cat was named Cat.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>We felt much less superior after that, which was a good thing.<br>I pulled into the parking lot. I waited until a strike erupted from<br>the bowling alley&#x2014; <i>thank you, thank you, friends</i>&#x2014; then stepped<br>out of the car. I admired the surroundings, still not bored with the<br>broken- in view: the squatty blond- brick post office across the street<br>(now closed on Saturdays), the unassuming beige office building just<br>down the way (now closed, period). The town wasn&#x2019;t prosperous, not<br>anymore, not by a long shot. Hell, it wasn&#x2019;t even original, being one<br>of two Carthage, Missouris&#x2014; ours is technically <i>North </i>Carthage,<br>which makes it sound like a twin city, although it&#x2019;s hundreds of miles<br>from the other and the lesser of the two: a quaint little 1950s town<br>that bloated itself into a basic midsize suburb and dubbed it progress.<br>Still, it was where my mom grew up and where she raised me and Go,<br>so it had some history. Mine, at least.<br>&nbsp;<br>As I walked toward the bar across the concrete- and- weed parking<br>lot, I looked straight down the road and saw the river.

It presents the ideas of challenging societal expectations and tradition and expressing yourself freely in kid-terms that are both funny and thought provoking--it even functions as a guidebook for adults to understand what it is to be a critically thinking, creative individual.

It was a move that brought to the fore the Austrian composer's genius for discovering fresh and convincing formal solutions for his musical aims. Without a specific dramatic "program" or narrative live, the Fifth Symphony moves forward in vivid, emotionally compelling musical shapes that begin in funereal gloom and build to climactic expressions of heroic triumph and ultimate joy.<br>In his Sixth Symphony, Mahler continued to explore the potential of the instrumental symphony, but followed an opposite dramatic course to that of the Fifth, this time building to a series of shattering climaxes implying ultimate defeat and death. Both of these deeply moving works, composed between 1901 and 1906, are today among the most performed symphonic works in the orchestral repertoire. Both symphonies are reprinted here from authoritative full-score editions in a finely produced volume designed to provide a lifetime of enjoyment and study.</p><p></p></p><p>Austrian composer and conductor Gustav Mahler (1860&#x2013;1911) wrote chiefly symphonies and <i>Lieder. </i>Late Romantic in style, his tempestuous works reflect the anxious mood of Europe at the turn of the 20th century.

Not only did they invent, build, and fly the first airplane, they were also idiosyncratic individuals who had a unique relationship, sharing a home, a bank account, and a business throughout their lives. Their story is portrayed here in brief, accessible chapters, beginning with their childhood fascination with flight and love of problem solving, then detailing their early experiments and dangerous trial runs in North Carolina, and ending with their successful flights of 1903. This well-researched and personable biography is illustrated with elegant watercolors by flight enthusiast and noted artist Robert Andrew Parker.

Many biographies sufficiently document their trials, errors, and successes. And like Russell Freedman's The Wright Brothers (Holiday, 1991), they benefit from careful research; the brothers themselves took and left copious notes and photographs. The advantage of this presentation is its style and accessibility and the story it tells of two brothers (alike in goals, different in personalities) who had ideas and kept at them, whose parents nurtured those ideas, that creativity, and critical thinking. Old takes readers along with a chronological approach and stops after the first heavier-than-air manned flight. She relates how two bicycle repairmen solved the problems that leading scientists of the time had been unable to master. She carefully and almost effortlessly helps youngsters to understand the steps: wind resistance, drag, the need for rounded front edges on a propeller, more accurate air-pressure tables. But her story ultimately shows how the brothers worked together-almost in tandem-like the bicycle wheels in their shop, and how each man's strengths complemented the other's. Parker's characteristic watercolors do more than inform Old's straightforward story. They help to set an inventive tone-a kind of experimental fluidity that floats through the book-as if something might be going to happen. And for young readers, something indeed does.<br><i>Harriett Fargnoli, Great Neck Library, NY</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The End of Accounting and the Path Forward for Investors and Managers (Wiley Finance)</h2><p><b>An innovative new valuation framework with truly useful economic indicators</b> <p><i>The End of Accounting and the Path Forward for Investors and Managers</i> shows how the ubiquitous financial reports have become useless in capital market decisions and lays out an actionable alternative. Based on a comprehensive, large-sample empirical analysis, this book reports financial documents' continuous deterioration in relevance to investors' decisions. An enlightening discussion details the reasons why accounting is losing relevance in today's market, backed by numerous examples with real-world impact. Beyond simply identifying the problem, this report offers a solution&#x2015;the Value Creation Report&#x2015;and demonstrates its utility in key industries. New indicators focus on strategy and execution to identify and evaluate a company's true value-creating resources for a more up-to-date approach to critical investment decision-making. </p><p>While entire industries have come to rely on financial reports for vital information, these documents are flawed and insufficient when it comes to the way investors and lenders work in the current economic climate. This book demonstrates an alternative, giving you a new framework for more informed decision making. </p><ul> <li>Discover a new, comprehensive system of economic indicators</li> <li>Focus on strategic, value-creating resources in company valuation</li> <li>Learn how traditional financial documents are quickly losing their utility</li> <li>Find a path forward with actionable, up-to-date information</li> </ul> <p>Major corporate decisions, such as restructuring and M&amp;A, are predicated on financial indicators of profitability and asset/liabilities values.

Inside, the authors share their radical findings from examining quarterly earnings conference calls and investor meetings in four major economic sectors, revealing that a company's worth lies in the strategic, value-enhancing resources it holds rather than the traditional assets in corporate financial reports. This groundbreaking process is more than a way to avoid investing in companies with misleading financial reports; it's also proven to uncover the companies poised to capture major market share, but currently burdened by red ink on their books. The conclusions inside fly in the face of conventional investment wisdom and practice, but they were reached by extensive examination of real-world facts and, as you will see, proven in numerous case studies.

This new text is revised, updated and expanded by best-selling popular-science author Russell Stannard (author of the much-acclaimed Uncle Albert series of books for children).George Gamow (1904 to 1968) was not only one of the most influential physicists of the twentieth century (one of the founders of the Big Bang theory) but was also a master at science popularisation.

A former game designer and editor, he lives in southern Wisconsin with his wife, Andria.One<br><br> Evening had come to Unity Green, and the first hawk-bats were already out, dipping down to pluck yammal-jells and coufee eels from the rolling whitecaps on Liberation Lake. On the far shore, the yorik coral bluffs that marked the edge of the park had grown purple and shadowed. Beyond them, the durasteel skeletons of the rising skytowers gleamed crimson in the setting sun. The planet remained as much Yuuzhan&#x2019;tar as Coruscant, and in many ways that would never change. But it was at peace. For the first time in Luke Skywalker&#x2019;s life, the galaxy was truly not at war&#x2014;and that counted for everything.<br><br> There were still problems, of course. There always would be, and today several senior Masters were struggling to address the chaos that Jaina and four other young Jedi Knights had caused by abruptly abandoning their duties and departing for the Unknown Regions.<br><br> &#x201c;Lowbacca was the only one who completely understood the biomechanics of the Maledoth,&#x201d; Corran Horn was saying in his throaty voice. &#x201c;So, as you can see, the Ramoan relocation project has ground to a complete standstill.&#x201d;<br><br> Luke reluctantly shifted his gaze from the viewport to the council room&#x2019;s speaking circle, where Corran stood using a laser- wand to highlight the holographic projection of a huge Yuuzhan Vong slaveship. The Jedi order had been hoping to use the vessel to evacuate the population of a dying world.<br><br> Corran flicked the laserwand, and the holograph switched to the image of blast-pocked asteroid miner. &#x201c;The situation in the Maltorian mining belt is deteriorating as well. Without Zekk there to lead the hunt, Three-Eye&#x2019;s pirates have the run of the system. Raw material shipments have fallen by fifty percent, and RePlanetHab is trying to buy them off.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s one circuit we need to kill now,&#x201d; Mara said. Seated in the chair next to Luke&#x2019;s, she was&#x2014;as usual&#x2014;the first to cut to the heart of the matter. That was one of the things Luke most admired about her; in a time when the smallest decision carried ramifications that even a Columi dejarik champion could not predict, his wife&#x2019;s instincts remained steady and true. &#x201c;If rehab conglomerates start buying off pirates, we&#x2019;ll have marauders popping up all over the Core.&#x201d;<br><br> The other Masters voiced their agreement.<br><br> &#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Corran said. &#x201c;Where do we find a replacement for Zekk?&#x201d;<br><br> No one rushed to answer. The Jedi were spread too thin already, with most Jedi Knights&#x2014;and even some apprentices&#x2014;already assigned three tasks. And as the ranks of the greedy and the selfish grew ever more adept at manipulating the Galactic Alliance Senate, the situation seemed increasingly desperate.<br><br> Finally, Kyp Durron said, &#x201c;The Solos should be finished on Borao soon.&#x201d; Dressed in threadbare cape and tunic, wearing his brown hair long and shaggy, Kyp looked as though he had just come in from a long mission. He always looked like that. &#x201c;Maybe RePlanetHab will be patient if they know they&#x2019;re the Solos&#x2019; next assignment.&#x201d;<br><br> The silence this time was even longer than the last. Strictly speaking, the Solos were not available for assignments. Han wasn&#x2019;t even a Jedi, and Leia&#x2019;s status was completely informal. The council just kept asking them to help out, they just kept doing it, and every Master in the room knew the order had been exploiting the Solos&#x2019; selfless natures for far too long.<br><br> &#x201c;Someone else needs to contact them,&#x201d; Mara finally said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s getting so bad that Leia cringes whenever she sees Luke&#x2019;s face on the holocomm.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I can do it,&#x201d; Kyp offered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m used to making Leia cringe.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That takes care of Maltoria,&#x201d; Corran said. &#x201c;Now, what about the Bothan ar&#x2019;krai? Alema&#x2019;s last report suggested that Reh&#x2019;mwa and his fundamentalists had a line on Zonama Sekot&#x2019;s location. They were provisioning the Avengeance for a scouting mission into the Unknown Regions.&#x201d;<br><br> A subtle eddy in the Force drew Luke&#x2019;s attention toward the entrance. He raised a hand to stop the discussion.<br><br> &#x201c;Excuse me.&#x201d; He turned toward the foyer and immersed his mind completely in the Force until he recognized one of the presences coming toward them, then said, &#x201c;Perhaps we should continue this later. We don&#x2019;t want Chief Omas to know how concerned we are about Jaina&#x2019;s departure.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No.&#x201d; Luke rose and started toward the door. &#x201c;Especially not when he&#x2019;s bringing Chiss.&#x201d;<br><br> Luke stopped in the foyer area, where a simple wooden bench and two empty stone vases sat opposite the door, arranged to subtly calm visitors and make them feel welcome. Barely a moment passed before the door hissed open and a young apprentice came to a surprised halt directly in front of Luke.<br><br> &#x201c;M-master S-skywalker!&#x201d; the young Rodian stammered. He turned and raised a spindly-fingered hand toward the door. &#x201c;Chief Omas and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I know, Twool. Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br> Luke nudged the youth back into the corridor with the other apprentice, then stepped into the doorway and found himself looking at Chief of State Cal Omas and a trio of blue-skinned Chiss. With a wrinkled face and sagging jowls, the Chiss in front was probably the oldest Luke had ever seen. The two in the rear were clearly bodyguards&#x2014;tall, strong, alert, and dressed in the black uniforms of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet.<br><br> &#x201c;Chief Omas,&#x201d; Luke said. The strains of Omas&#x2019;s office showed in his hollow cheeks and ashen complexion. &#x201c;Welcome.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re expecting us.&#x201d; Omas cast a pointed glance into the conference room. &#x201c;Good.&#x201d;<br><br> Luke ignored the hint and bowed to the elderly Chiss.<br><br> &#x201c;And Aristocra . . .&#x201d; It took a moment for the name to rise to the top of Omas&#x2019;s mind, where Luke could sense it without being overly intrusive. &#x201c;Mitt&#x2019;swe&#x2019;kleoni. It&#x2019;s a pleasure to make your acquaintance.&#x201d;<br><br> The Chiss&#x2019;s red eyes narrowed to crimson lines. &#x201c;Very impressive. It&#x2019;s not easy to gather identity files on Chiss aristocracy.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Luke smiled and continued to block the door. &#x201c;You and your bodyguards are welcome to come inside, once you have removed your hidden weapons.&#x201d;<br><br> Omas cringed visibly, but Luke did not move. Even had he not perceived the concealed weapons through the Force, he still would have made the request. These were Chiss, after all.<br><br> &#x201c;As you know,&#x201d; Luke continued, &#x201c;the only weapons allowed in the Jedi Temple are lightsabers.&#x201d;<br><br> Mitt&#x2019;swe&#x2019;kleoni smiled like an old man caught sipping something against his doctor&#x2019;s orders, then pulled a small hold-out blaster from his boot and passed it to a bodyguard.<br><br> &#x201c;My bodyguards will wait in the corridor,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I can see they wouldn&#x2019;t be of much use in a room full of Jedi.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;There would be no need.&#x201d; Luke stepped aside and waved the two statesmen toward the conference circle. &#x201c;Please join us.&#x201d;<br><br> As they crossed the room, Mitt&#x2019;swe&#x2019;kleoni kept sneaking glances at its appointments&#x2014;the automated service kitchen, the small forest of rare trebala plants, the flowform chairs&#x2014;and the arrogance vanished from his demeanor. It was not a reaction Luke liked to see. The new Temple had been a gift from the Galactic Alliance, pressed on the Jedi when&#x2014;in a desperate attempt to manufacture a symbol of progress&#x2014;the faltering Reconstruction Authority had moved the seat of government back to Coruscant. In most regards, the relocation had failed as spectacularly as it had deserved. But the Temple, a stone-and-transparisteel pyramid designed to harmonize with the new face of postwar Coruscant, never failed to impress with its regal scale and Rebirth architecture. It also served as a constant reminder to Luke of his greatest fear, that the Jedi would start to perceive themselves through the eyes of others and become little more than the guardians of a grateful Galactic Alliance.<br><br> At the conference area, the Jedi Masters rose to greet their guests.<br><br> &#x201c;Everyone knows Chief Omas, I think.&#x201d; Luke motioned Omas into a chair, then took Mitt&#x2019;swe&#x2019;kleoni by the elbow and guided him into the sunken speaking circle. &#x201c;This is Aristocra Mitt&#x2019;swe&#x2019;kleoni from the Chiss empire.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Please use my core name, Tswek,&#x201d; the Aristocra instructed. &#x201c;It will be much easier for you to pronounce correctly.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Luke said, continuing to look at the council. &#x201c;Tswek has some disturbing news for us, I believe.&#x201d;<br><br> Tswek&#x2019;s wrinkled brow rose, but he no longer seemed surprised by Luke&#x2019;s &#x201c;intuition.&#x201d; &#x201c;Then you know the purpose of my visit?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We can sense your apprehension through the Force,&#x201d; Luke said, avoiding a direct answer. &#x201c;I assume it concerns our Jedi in the Unknown Regions.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Indeed it does,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The Chiss Ascendancy requires an explanation.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;An explanation?&#x201d; Corran was not quite able to conceal his indignation. &#x201c;Of what?&#x201d;<br><br> Tswek pointedly ignored Corran and continued to stare at Luke.<br><br> &#x201c;The Jedi have many voices, Aristocra,&#x201d; Luke said. &#x201c;But we speak as one.&#x201d;<br><br> Tswek considered this a moment, then nodded. &#x201c;Very well.&#x201d; He turned to Corran. &#x201c;We demand an explanation of your actions, of course. What happens on our frontier is no concern of yours.&#x201d;<br><br> Despite the wave of confusion and doubt that rippled through the Force, the Jedi Masters remained outwardly composed.<br><br> &#x201c;The Chisz frontier, Aristocra?&#x201d; Saba Sebatyne, one of the newest Jedi Masters, asked.<br><br> &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; Tswek turned to the Barabel, his brow furrowed in thought. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know what your Jedi Knights have been doing, do you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;All of our Jedi are well trained,&#x201d; Luke said to Tswek. &#x201c;And the five under discussion are very experienced. We&#x2019;re confident they have good reason for any action they&#x2019;ve undertaken.&#x201d;<br><br> A glint of suspicion showed in Tswek&#x2019;s crimson eyes. &#x201c;So far, we have identified seven Jedi.&#x201d; He turned to Omas. &#x201c;It appears I have no business here after all. Obviously, the Jedi involved in this matter are acting on their own.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Involved in what matter?&#x201d; Kyp asked.<br><br> &#x201c;That is of no concern to the Galactic Alliance,&#x201d; Tswek said. He bowed to the council at large. &#x201c;My apologies for taking so much of your time.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No apologies are necessary,&#x201d; Luke said. He considered dropping the name of Chaf&#x2019;orm&#x2019;bintrani, an Aristocra he and Mara had met on a mission some years earlier, but it was impossible to know how this would be received. Chiss politics were as volatile as they were secretive, and for all Luke knew Formbi&#x2019;s had been one of the five ruling families that had mysteriously disappeared while the rest of the galaxy fought the Yuuzhan Vong. &#x201c;Anything in which our Jedi Knights involve themselves concerns this council.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Then I suggest you do a better job supervising them in the future,&#x201d; Tswek said. When Luke did not step out of his way, he turned to Omas. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m quite finished here, Chief.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; Omas shot Luke a look imploring him to stand aside, then said, &#x201c;An escort will meet you at the Temple entrance. I believe I need to have a word with these Jedi.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;In that case, I&#x2019;ll thank you for your hospitality now.&#x201d; Tswek bowed to the Chief, then started for the door. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be returning to the Ascendancy within the hour.&#x201d;<br><br> Omas waited until the Aristocra was gone, then scowled at Luke. &#x201c;Well?&#x201d;<br><br> Luke spread his hands. &#x201c;At this point, Chief Omas, you know more than we do.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I was afraid of that,&#x201d; Omas growled. &#x201c;Apparently, a team of Jedi have involved themselves in a border dispute with the Chiss.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How can that be?&#x201d; Mara asked. Luke knew that she meant the question literally. Before departing, Jaina had sent the council a set of destination coordinates that she and the others had calculated by triangulating the direction from which the mysterious call had come. An astronomical reconnaissance had revealed not even a star in the area, and certainly no indication that the coordinates would be of interest to the Chiss. &#x201c;Their destination was over a hundred light-years from Ascendancy space.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Then our Jedi are out there,&#x201d; Omas said. &#x201c;What in the blazes for? We can&#x2019;t spare one Jedi at the moment, much less seven.&#x201d;<br><br> Mara&#x2019;s green eyes looked ready to loose a stream of blaster bolts. &#x201c;Our Jedi, Chief Omas?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Forgive me.&#x201d; The Chief&#x2019;s voice was more placating than apologetic; Luke knew that, in his heart, Omas considered the Jedi as much servants of the Galactic Alliance as he was. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean to imply anything.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Of course not,&#x201d; Mara said, in a tone that suggested he had better be serious. She turned to the rest of the council. &#x201c;Mitt&#x2019;swe&#x2019;kleoni said seven Jedi. What do we make of that?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;This one only countz five.&#x201d; Saba lifted her hand and began to raise her taloned fingers. &#x201c;Jaina, Alema, Zekk, Lowbacca, and Tesar.&#x201d;<br><br> Kyp added two fingers. &#x201c;Tekli and Tahiri?&#x201d;<br><br> Omas frowned. &#x201c;How could you know that? I thought they were with Zonama Sekot in the Unknown Regions.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re supposed to be,&#x201d; Corran said. &#x201c;But, like the others, they&#x2019;re also Myrkr survivors.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; Omas said. &#x201c;What does this have to do with the Myrkr mission?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I wish we knew,&#x201d; Luke said. Undertaken in the middle of the war with the Yuuzhan Vong, the Myrkr mission had been as costly as it had been successful. Anakin Solo and his strike team had destroyed the enemy&#x2019;s Jedi-killing voxyn. But six young Jedi Knights had died in the process&#x2014;including Anakin himself&#x2014;and another was missing and presumed lost. &#x201c;All I can tell you is that for several weeks, Jaina and the other survivors of that mission reported feeling a &#x2018;call&#x2019; from the Unknown Regions. On the day they left, that call became a cry for help.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And since we know Tenel Ka is still on Hapes,&#x201d; Mara explained, &#x201c;it seems likely the extra Jedi are Tekli and Tahiri.&#x201d;<br><br> Nobody suggested that Jaina&#x2019;s brother, Jacen, might be one of the extras. The last anyone had heard, he had been somewhere on the far side of the galaxy, sequestered with the Fallanassi.<br><br> &#x201c;What about Zonama Sekot?&#x201d; Omas asked. Zonama Sekot was the living planet that had agreed to serve as home to the defeated Yuuzhan Vong. &#x201c;Could the call have come from it?&#x201d;<br><br> Luke shook his head. &#x201c;Zonama Sekot would have contacted me directly if it needed our help. I&#x2019;m convinced this has something to do with the mission to Myrkr.&#x201d;<br><br> Omas stayed silent, waiting for more of an explanation, but that was all Luke knew.<br><br> Instead, Luke asked, &#x201c;What did Mitt&#x2019;swe&#x2019;kleoni tell you?&#x201d;<br><br> Omas shrugged. &#x201c;He demanded to know why the Galactic Alliance had sent its Jedi&#x2014;his words&#x2014;to interfere in a Chiss border dispute. When he saw how surprised I was, he demanded to speak to you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;This is bad,&#x201d; Mara said. &#x201c;Very bad.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I agree,&#x201d; Omas said. &#x201c;Either he thinks we&#x2019;re all lying&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Or he believez our Jedi Knightz have gone rogue,&#x201d; Saba finished. &#x201c;In either case, the result will be the same.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll try to solve the problem themselves,&#x201d; Omas said. He ran a hand through his thinning hair. &#x201c;How hard will this be on them?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Our Jedi Knights can take care of themselves,&#x201d; Luke said.<br><br> &#x201c;I know that!&#x201d; Omas snapped. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m asking about the Chiss.&#x201d;<br><br> Luke felt Mara&#x2019;s ire rise, but she chose to overlook Omas&#x2019;s tone and remain silent. Now was a poor time to remind him that the Jedi did not expect to be addressed as though they were unruly subordinates.<br><br> &#x201c;If the Chiss take action against them, Jaina and the others will attempt to defuse the situation . . . for a time,&#x201d; Luke said. &#x201c;After that, it depends on the nature of the conflict.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But they won&#x2019;t hesitate to meet force with force,&#x201d; Mara clari- fied. &#x201c;Nor would we ask them to. If the Chiss push things, sooner or later Jaina is going to bloody their noses.&#x201d;<br><br> Omas paled and turned to Luke. &#x201c;You need to put a stop to this, and soon. We can&#x2019;t let it come to killing...</p><h2>Raising Positive Kids in a Negative World</h2><p><p>Raising positive, drug-free kids in a negative world is not easy, but in the long run it's easier than raising negative ones.

Once awakened, often through meditation and yoga practices, it rises up the spine and finds expression in the form of spiritual knowledge, mystical vision, psychic powers, and ultimately, enlightenment. <br><br>This is the classic first-person account of Gopi Krishna, an ordinary Indian householder who, at the age of thirty-four, after years of unsupervised meditation, suddenly experienced the awakening of kundalini during his morning practice. The story of this transformative experience, and the author's struggle to find balance amid a variety of powerful physiological and psychic side effects, forms the core of the book. His detailed descriptions of his dramatic inner experiences and symptoms such as mood swings, eating disorders, and agonizing sensations of heat&#x2014;and of how, with the help of his wife, he finally stabilized at a higher level of consciousness&#x2014;make this one of the most valuable classics of spiritual awakening available.</p><p>Gopi Krishna (1903&#x2013;1984) was an ordinary Indian householder who experienced the awakening of the spiritual force known as kundalini at the age of thirty-four. He subsequently became the inspired writer of numerous books in which he shared his insights with others."Gopi Krishna was a pioneer in the land of spirituality."&#x2014;Deepak Chopra, M.D.<br>"Gopi Krishna never felt that what took place was personally his.

She went quietly, her body still, and Dane was at her bedside to see her go. The ICU physician said it was inevitable, only a matter of minutes once they removed the ventilator, and so it was. Her heart went into premature ventricular contractions, stopped, restarted momentarily, and then the line on the heart monitor went flat.<br> <br>It happened more quickly than anyone expected.<br> <br>She was an organ donor, so she had to be removed immediately for procurement. Dane touched her hand to say good-bye, and blood and skin came off on his fingers.<br> <br>A nurse wheeled him out of the room. She found a secluded corner out on the fourth floor patio, a place with a view of the city and shade from the Nevada sun, and left him to grieve.<br> <br>Now, try as he might to fathom such feelings, grief and horror were inseparably mixed. When he wiped his tears, her blood smeared his face. When he tried to envision how she gladdened whenever she saw him, how she would tilt her head and shrug one shoulder and her eyes would sparkle as she broke into that smile, he would see her through the blackening glass, crumpled over the steering wheel, the deflated airbag curling at the edges, melting into her face.<br> <br>A handkerchief made careful passes over his face below and around his eyes. Arnie was trying to clean him up. Dane couldn&#x2019;t say anything; he just let him do it.<br> <br>The smell under his robe found his attention: sweat, antiseptics, gauze, bandages. His right shoulder still felt on fire, only, thanks to the painkillers, on fire somewhere else far away. Not a serious burn, they told him, so he kept telling himself. The bruises ate away at him, little monsters sequestered against his bones, festering under all that blued flesh in his side, his right hip, his right shoulder. It hurt to sit in the wheelchair; it hurt more to walk.<br> <br>He broke again, covering his eyes to ward off the vision of her hair crinkling, vaporizing down to her scalp, steam and smoke rising through her blouse, flames licking through the broken glass, but it remained. Oh, God! Why? How could He change her so instantly from what she was&#x2014;the woman, the saint, his lover with the laughing eyes, wacky humor, and wisdom of years&#x2014;to what Dane had just seen perish on a bloodied gurney behind a curtain, sustained by tubes, monitors, machines? The images replayed. He thought he would vomit again.<br> <br>Arnie brought the pan and a towel close under his chin.<br> <br>He drew in a long, quaking breath, then another, then centered his mind on every breath that followed, commanding, controlling each one.<br> <br>Arnie put the pan aside and sat close, silent.<br> <br>Dane gave his weeping free rein; there could be no stopping it even as his bruises tortured him with every quake of his body. The moment passed, not in minutes but in breaths, thoughts, memories, wrenchings in his soul, until somewhere in his mind, just slightly removed from the visions, the soul pain, the hospital smells, and the painkillers, he took hold of what he already knew.<br> <br>He could hardly place the breath behind the words. &#x201c;I am just so much going to miss her.&#x201d;<br> <br>Arnie blew his nose on the same handkerchief he&#x2019;d used to clean Dane&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;You may never finish saying good-bye. Maybe that&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d; He cleared his throat. &#x201c;If it were me, I could never give her up.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dane noticed the move of the breeze over his face, the warmth of the sun on the patio. Birds flitted and chattered in the arbor. Mandy was about things like that.<br> <br>&#x201c;I suppose there were many who loved her,&#x201d; Dane said. &#x201c;But it was my arm she took to go to parties; she wrote her love notes for me; she chose to share my future when I didn&#x2019;t even have one.&#x201d; His vision blurred with fresh tears. &#x201c;How did a guy like me rate a woman like her?&#x201d;<br> <br>Arnie touched him on the left shoulder, the one that wouldn&#x2019;t hurt. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the stuff you wanna remember.&#x201d;<br> <br>Arnie Harrington, his agent but mostly his friend, a little on the heavy side, still had some hair but not much, and had to be as old as Dane but didn&#x2019;t look it. How he found out there&#x2019;d been an accident Dane would have to ask him later. It was only now that Dane fully recognized he was here.<br> <br>He drew a breath to calm his insides and touched Arnie&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Thanks for coming.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Got a call from Jimmy Bryce over at the Mirage. He thought it was a rumor so he called me. I suppose I can call him back, but it&#x2019;ll be all over town by now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Guess it&#x2019;ll be in the papers.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Guess they&#x2019;re already writing it. I&#x2019;ll handle all of that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d appreciate it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dane followed Arnie&#x2019;s gaze toward the Las Vegas Strip, where every structure, object, entrance, and electric light vied for attention. It was no great revelation, but after all the years he and Mandy worked here, all he could see, all he cared to remember was the woman who remained real in such an unreal place. &#x201c;I got way better than I deserved.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, yeah.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Forty years.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Like I said . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Forty years . . .&#x201d; The fact came alive as he lingered on it and salved the horrors from his mind, at least for now. With no effort at all the unfaded image of Mandy first setting foot in his life played before his eyes, the dove girl sitting in the front row who caught and held his eye . . . to the swelling, carnival sound of a gilded merry-go-round.</p><h2>Stand Fast in the Way of Truth: Fathers and Sons Volume 1</h2><p><i>Stand Fast in the Way of Truth</i> draws fathers and teenage sons into a purposeful study about what it means to be a man.<br><br>Doug Bond wants to strengthen and equip young men to take every thought captive as they strive to love and adore Christ in our culture.

Beginning with the historical context of the recovery movement and its recent emergence on the center stage of mental health policy around the world, the authors then clarify various definitions of mental health recovery and address the most common misconceptions of recovery held by skeptical practitioners and worried families. With this framework in place, the authors suggest fundamental principles for recovery-oriented care, a set of concrete practice guidelines developed in and for the field, a recovery guide model of practice as an alternative to clinical case management, and tools to self-assess the recovery orientation of practices and practitioners. In doing so, this volume represents the first book to go beyond the rhetoric of recovery to its implementation in everyday practice.<br> <br> Much of this work was developed with the State of Connecticut's Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, helping the state to win a #1 ranking in the recent NAMI report card on state mental health authorities. Since initial development of these principles, guidelines, and tools in Connecticut, the authors have become increasingly involved in refining and tailoring this approach for other systems of care around the globe as more and more governments, ministry leaders, system managers, practitioners, and people with serious mental illnesses and their families embrace the need to transform mental health services to promote recovery and community inclusion.<br> <br> If you've wondered what all of the recent to-do has been about with the notion of "recovery" in mental health, this book explains it. In addition, it gives you an insider's view of the challenges and strategies involved in transforming to recovery and a road map to follow on the first few steps down this exciting, promising, and perhaps long overdue path.<br></p><p>Larry Davidson is Director of the Program on Recovery and Community Health at the Institute for Social and Policy Studies at Yale University.

Essays. Winner of the 2015 Essay Collection Competition, Selected by Wayne Koestenbaum.<br><br> "Rarely have I come across tenderness, venom, and fire held so intimately, so exquisitely, as in Lily Hoang's A BESTIARY. This book would be impressive enough as a collection of finely-forged fragments, but as it weaves itself into an even more impressive whole, my hat came off. Lily Hoang writes like she has nothing to lose and everything at stake."&#x2014;Maggie Nelson<br><br>"A BESTIARY is a work of great subtlety, precision, intelligence, daring, and emotive keenness. It seems completely contemporary (by which I mean that it is unlike anything I've read and that it makes me want to change my own writerly procedures). With head-long, reckless, improvisatory gestures, Lily Hoang prompts us to rethink what literature today can dare to aspire to. Her intellectually magnanimous book's position on the threshold between recognizable 'literature' and some other vanguard form of performance/utterance made me feel happy and stimulated and dizzy (in a rapturous way) while I was reading it."&#x2014;Wayne Koestenbaum<br> <br> "The most perfect use of fragmentation, myth, language, fairytale, and terrible beauty that I have ever seen in my life. I'm swooning.

Hoang models her postcolonial bestiary on the Chinese zodiac A pack of dogs. A swarm of insects. A mischief of rats./ You desire the human equivalent and uses it to represent such concepts as fidelity, beauty, and the disgust of desire. In doing so, she confronts such topics as feminine subjection, familial suffering due to assimilation ( Vietnamese women suffer better than all other people, my mother used to tell me ), and a sister s addiction and death with a precision that is by turns vulnerable and justly incensed. Hoang subverts the moralizing tendencies of folklore to form a new hybrid mythology that, like all belief systems, reassures the believer and the reader that human vulnerability is undergirded by a sense of mutual care. In order to join the collective, you must un-become, lose your face and skin, eject your identity, she writes. This is called belonging. In Hoang s mutinous cosmos, time warps and dilates to link ruptures between games and reality, the living and the dead, pain internalized and sickness expressed.

He describes, with boundless enthusiasm and humor, how travel to the future is not only possible but has already happened, and he contemplates whether travel to the past is also conceivable.

Protestants deny it even exists, while many Catholics fundamentally misunderstand it. It is Purgatory: that place of purifying penance where souls saved by Christ are made perfect and acceptable to spend life eternal in heaven.<br><br> In The Biblical Basis For Purgatory, author and apologist John Salza (Why Catholics Cannot Be Masons) offers the definitive scriptural explanation of this distinctively Catholic doctrine. Building on the teachings of Christ and St. Paul, he shows how the existence of a place of temporal punishment after death is not only a logical extension of what we know about the reality of sin and God's justice, but is also a supreme expression of God's love and mercy.<br><br> Although Purgatory is a place of mercy, its pains are real, and they are severe. This book does more than defend and explain Purgatory it provides a solid plan, drawn from the Church s perennial wisdom for conquering our sins by God s grace, while still on earth.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>John Salza was born on November 30, 1967, and is an apologist, author, and speaker. He became an attorney after being raised Catholic, but joined the Freemasons in 1996 for several years before giving up his membership. He is the author of <i>Why Catholics Cannot Be Masons</i>, <i>The Mystery of Predestination</i>, <i>Masonry Unmasked</i>, and <i>The Biblical Basis for Purgatory</i>. He has also appeared on Ave Maria radio and hosts the radio program <i>Relevant Answers</i>.<br> John Salza is held as a leading defender of the Catholic faith, and is devoted to apologetics.

Philosophy professor, novelist, and MacArthur Fellow Rebecca Goldstein reinterprets the evidence and restores to G�del's famous idea the meaning he claimed he intended: that there is a mathematical truth--an objective certainty--underlying everything and existing independently of human thought. G�del, Goldstein maintains, was an intellectual heir to Plato whose sense of alienation from the positivists and postmodernists of the 1940s was only ameliorated by his friendship with another intellectual giant, Albert Einstein. As Goldstein writes, "That his work, like Einstein's, has been interpreted as not only consistent with the revolt against objectivity but also as among its most compelling driving forces is ... more than a little ironic."<p> This and other paradoxes of G�del's life are woven throughout <i>Incompleteness</i>, with biographical details taking something of a back seat to the philosophical and mathematical underpinnings of his theories. As an introduction to one of the three most profound scientific insights of the 20th century (the other two being Einstein's relativity and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle), <i>Incompleteness</i> is accessible, yet intellectually rigorous. Goldstein succeeds admirably in retiring inaccurate interpretations of G�del's ideas. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>Rebecca Goldstein is a MacArthur Fellow, a professor of philosophy, and the author of five novels and a collection of short stories.

Fox tantalizingly suggests that the most prayerful, most spiritually powerful act a person can undertake is to create, at his or her own level, with a consciousness of the place from which that gift arises.</p><p><b>Matthew Fox</b> is well-known for having revived the tradition of Creation Spirituality and for being a compelling voice for ecological and socially progressive causes. He is the author of 35 books, including <i>Original Blessing</i>, which has sold more than a quarter million copies. He is the recipient of the Courage of Conscience Award given by the Peace Abbey of Sherborn, Massachusetts. Other recipients have included the Dalai Lama, Mother Teresa, Ernesto Cardenal, and Rosa Parks. He lives in California, where he has founded the University of Creation Spirituality, and is codirector of the Naropa Institute in Oakland.Once more, with feeling. Having written more than 20 books on the themes of prayer, spirituality and concern for the earth, Episcopal priest and New Age icon Fox doesn't plow much new territory in this intermittently eloquent meditation on tapping into the power of human creativity. Using nuggets of wisdom from various religions and philosophies, with Christian terminology used to buttress his points, the founder and president of the University of Creation Spirituality argues that we are living in a time of ecological and spiritual crisis. In using our creativity, that which differentiates us from other species, in nurturing our sense of gratitude for life as a gift and accepting the inevitability of suffering, we can consciously decide to be faithful to our divine potential and likeness. The choice is ours: praise, joy and union with the universe, or addiction, consumerism and destruction. All of our social, religious, economic systems, even our personal lifestyle choices, are in dire need of re-examination and renewal, says the author. "This is redemption: that we be creative like God is. And that our creativity and co-creation serve God's agenda, which is always compassion." Pushing well beyond the bounds of conventional Christian doctrine, the writer's attempt to shape a new ethic will be welcomed by his many fans. Whether this sometimes repetitive and occasionally provocative book will inspire new converts remains to be seen.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Encyclopedia of Native Tribes of North America</h2><p><p> Praise for the first edition: </p><p> <i>"A model of excellence in the art of reference volume publishing ...

Johnson has researched Native American history and culture for more than 35 years, and has numerous books on the subject. In July 2000, he received The Denali Press Award from the American Library Association for the <i>Macmillan Encyclopedia of Native American Tribes</i>. He has visited more than 30 Indian communities and reservations. </p><p>Foreword<br> By Dr. James A. Clifton Ph.D., Adjunct Professor, U.S. Marine Corps Command and Staff College</p> <p>I thought that the first edition of this beautiful book was a near-flawless example of the book publishing art. So I am delighted to see this somewhat enlarged new edition, the original gem much improved by the addition of new facets and a polishing of the whole. Author Michael Johnson, illustrator Richard Hook and the publisher's copy editors and book designers have obviously collaborated to superb effect in this upgrading.</p> <p>In the original, Hook's panoptic multitribal color plates were stunning, but so full of visual information about crafts and costumes as to overwhelm the viewer. These multitribal plates were also separated from the pertinent text entries. In the new edition, the composite plates have been broken up, each separate figure enlarged and relocated adjacent to the appropriate text description, with substantial reinforcing effect. That decision was obviously an editor's or book designer's decision, unnamed talents who deserve credit for contributing to the usefulness of this book. Author and publisher also have added a great many additional photographic plates, historic and contemporary. Altogether, this is the most lavishly illustrated reference book about North American Indians available in print.</p> <p>Michael Johnson has corrected the few glitches in his original exposition, updated numerous entries following recently published scholarly works, and included a useful, illustrated glossary. Adding to his original scholarship, Johnson has produced a sound, accurate and concise course of instruction about the native tribes of North America.</p> <p>This new edition is an updated, enlarged (sufficient to lose the "Concise" in the first edition's title) model of excellence in the art of reference volume publishing. With Michael Johnson and Richard Hook, they have produced a beginning student's book, a collector's book, a young person's book, a librarian's book, an artist's book, a general reader's book, a costume designer's book and even a scholar's book. It is a banquet for the eyes, a pleasure to hold and handle, and a resource for the mind.</p> <p>Johnson, one of the world's most respected savants of North American Indian arts, crafts and material culture, worked in close partnership with famed illustrator, Richard Hook, whose color plates are meticulous in detail and dazzling in artistic quality. Of Johnson (an engineer by profession) it may be said that he is an amateur, meaning his lifelong pursuit of knowledge about Indians has been his avocation and that he lacks academic credentials to tack on to his name. But it must also fairly be said that he shares his status with Darwin and Gibbon. Of Hook it may be accurately said that in preparing his illustrations he had to work from archival or museum materials, visual and textual, rather than from living models, unlike his 19th-century predecessors such as George Winter, George Catlin or Rudolph Frederich Kurz. But it must also be fairly said that Hook is easily the superior in artistic talent and mastery of technique to any of his precursors.</p> <p>Johnson's introductory essay, covering prehistoric and historic Indian populations, languages and cultural distributions, and his 10 chapters describing the many tribes in North America's culture areas put me in mind of Frederick Webb Hodge's 1907 classic, <i>Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico</i>, which had the entire staff of the Smithsonian Institution's Bureau of American Ethnology, and other scholars, as contributors. This book is that sound, useful and handy a reference work. The author's coverage of the tribes in each culture area is comprehensive, not abbreviated, and his summaries of each tribe's affiliations and history are solid and perceptive.</p> <p>I am particularly impressed by the amount of attention Michael Johnson has given to the distinguishing details of the ethnology of North America. These details include a classification of Indian languages, together with a summary of culture areas; and lists of the tribes and languages (with translations of ethonyms) preceding each of the 10 culture area chapters, from the Northeastern Woodlands to the Arctic. His brief chapter, "The Indian Today," is honest and perceptive, and is sufficient to remind readers that "the Indian" certainly did not disappear with the passenger pigeon.</p> <p>For some decades a swelling popular and academic interest in North America's native peoples has caused a flood of hastily prepared "Dictionaries" or "Encyclopedias" of things Indian. The shelves of our libraries now groan with the weight of such poor stuff, typically as shaky in scholarship as they are inferior in accuracy in editing, art, print quality, paper and binding. <i>The Encyclopedia of Native Tribes of North America</i> does not belong in this opportunistic genre. It stands in marvelous contrast, in a class, and of a quality, by itself.</p> <p>James A .

He also had a lifelong passion for magic tricks and puzzles. Well known for his mathematical games column in <i>Scientific American</i> and his "Trick of the Month" in <i>Physics Teacher</i> magazine, Gardner attracted a loyal following with his intelligence, wit, and imagination. <p><b>Martin Gardner: A Remembrance <br></b>The worldwide mathematical community was saddened by the death of Martin Gardner on May 22, 2010. Martin was 95 years old when he died, and had written 70 or 80 books during his long lifetime as an author. Martin's first Dover books were published in 1956 and 1957: <i>Mathematics, Magic and Mystery,</i> one of the first popular books on the intellectual excitement of mathematics to reach a wide audience, and <i>Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science,</i> certainly one of the first popular books to cast a devastatingly skeptical eye on the claims of pseudoscience and the many guises in which the modern world has given rise to it. Both of these pioneering books are still in print with Dover today along with more than a dozen other titles of Martin's books. They run the gamut from his elementary <i>Codes, Ciphers and Secret Writing,</i> which has been enjoyed by generations of younger readers since the 1980s, to the more demanding <i>The New Ambidextrous Universe: Symmetry and Asymmetry from Mirror Reflections to Superstrings,</i> which Dover published in its final revised form in 2005. </p><p> </p><p>To those of us who have been associated with Dover for a long time, however, Martin was more than an author, albeit a remarkably popular and successful one. As a member of the small group of long-time advisors and consultants, which included NYU's Morris Kline in mathematics, Harvard's I. Bernard Cohen in the history of science, and MIT's J. P. Den Hartog in engineering, Martin's advice and editorial suggestions in the formative 1950s helped to define the Dover publishing program and give it the point of view which &#x2014; despite many changes, new directions, and the consequences of evolution &#x2014; continues to be operative today. </p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>In the Author's Own Words:<br></b>"Politicians, real-estate agents, used-car salesmen, and advertising copy-writers are expected to stretch facts in self-serving directions, but scientists who falsify their results are regarded by their peers as committing an inexcusable crime. Yet the sad fact is that the history of science swarms with cases of outright fakery and instances of scientists who unconsciously distorted their work by seeing it through lenses of passionately held beliefs." </p><p> </p><p>"A surprising proportion of mathematicians are accomplished musicians.

It tells of the dragon-slayer Sivrit, the mysterious kingdom of the Nibelungs, a priceless treasure guarded by dwarves and giants, an Amazonian queen, fortune-telling water-sprites, and a cloak of invisibility. Driven by the conflict between Kriemhilt, the innocent maiden turned she-devil, and her antagonist, the stoic, indomitable Hagen, the story is one of love, jealousy, murder, and revenge, ending in slaughter on a horrific scale. Since its rediscovery in the eighteenth century, the<em> Nibelungenlied</em> has come to be regarded as the national epic of the Germans, and has inspired countless adaptations, including Richard Wagner's Ring cycle. Cyril Edwards' prose translation, the first in forty years, is more accurate and accessible and captures the poem's epic qualities. Edwards also provides an introduction that discusses the poem's historical background and its status as German national epic. The volume includes an up-to-date bibliography, invaluable notes, a map, and a list of people and places.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Ten years after the crime, Tracey&#x2019;s case finally went to trial in an explosive courtroom showdown. In a searing exploration of the criminal mind, bestselling investigative journalist M.

In sheer daemonic strangeness and fertility of conception, Smith is perhaps unexcelled by any other writer.&#x201d; H. P. Lovecraft<br><br>Clark Ashton Smith, considered one of the greatest contributors to seminal pulp magazines such as Weird Tales, helped define and shape weird fiction&#x201d; in the early twentieth century, alongside contemporaries H. P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard, drawing upon his background in poetry to convey an unparalleled richness of imagination and expression in his stories of the bizarre and fantastical.<br><br>The Collected Fantasies series presents all of Smith&#x2019;s fiction chronologically. Authorized by the author&#x2019;s estate and endorsed by Arkham House, the stories in this series are accompanied by detailed background notes from editors Scott Connors and Ron Hilger, who in preparation for this collection meticulously compared original manuscripts, various typescripts, published editions, and Smith&#x2019;s own notes and letters. Their efforts have resulted in the most definitive and complete collection of the author&#x2019;s work to date.<br><br>The Last Hieroglyph is the fifth of five volumes collecting all of Clark Ashton Smith&#x2019;s tales of fantasy, horror, and science fiction. It includes all of his stories from "The Dark Age" (1933) to "The Dart of Rasasfa" (1961).</p><p><b>Clark Ashton Smith</b> was a self-educated poet and author best remembered for his short stories of fantasy, horror, and the supernatural published in genre pulp magazines such as Wonder Stories and Weird Tales in the late 1920s and 1930s. Smith died in 1961 in California.The fifth and final volume in this definitive collection (following Red World of Polaris and The Maze of the Enchanter) reveals Smith in the twilight of his career. As the editors note, Smith, "A stranger in a world he never made nor lived in happily or comfortably," excelled at creating vivid, phantasmagorical worlds, from the rugged Hyperboria of "The Seven Geases" to the lush post-apocalyptic setting of "The Dark Age." Ordered chronologically as they were composed, these works also reveal recurring themes, like deadly obsession in "The Treader of the Dust," "The Garden of Adompha," and "Nemesis of the Unfinished." Heroes strive but fail against power-hungry sorcerers in "The Death of Malygris," "The Seven Geases," and "Necromancy in Naat." Alternate worlds claim the unwary in "The Primal City," "Symposium of the Gorgon," and "The Great God Awto," while "The Chain of Aforgomon," "Double Cosmos," and the title story draw readers into recursive realities worthy of Borges. Readers seeking dense, ornate fantasies will enjoy these classic stories knit from flickering shadows, dark secrets, and twisted magic. <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

True Food Facts from Around the World and Throughout History</h2><p><b>An interesting and nose-wrinkling collection of true food facts from around the world and throughout history.</b><br><br>How about a nice dish of Colonial Squirrel Pie with a side of milkweed shoots? If that doesn&#x2019;t grab you, you might think about trying some Garbage Stew, just like they made in medieval England. But if you&#x2019;re feeling a little tired and need a boost, your best bet is roasted spiders. They&#x2019;ve got three times the protein of cooked beef. (Is your mouth watering yet?)<br> <br>Illustrated by the wildly-creative Eric Brace, <i>It&#x2019;s Disgusting and We Ate It!</i> is a fascinating look at culinary creations from all over the world!</p><p><p>I talked to people from all over the planet and combed through hundreds of books in my search for the world's funniest foods. Research meant picking violets for 500-year-old royal recipes, telephoning Australia to ask if any people there eat worms (they do), and pondering deep philosophical questions like "Which fried insects make the best after-school snack?" (Aristotle recommends cicadas fat with eggs.) I even talked to a scientist who ate meat from a 36,000-year-old bison found frozen in Alaska.</p>Grade 3-6ASolheim appeals to the gross-out side of kids in this exploration of edible grub (larvae and otherwise) around the world, past and present, and it's more laughs than a barrel of monkey brains (the one delicacy he missed). Divided into three sections, the book begins with "People Eat the Wildest Things," a look at some of the less common foods eaten today, such as frog legs, earthworms, snakes, insects, flowers, and seaweed. "From Mammoth Meatballs to Squirrel Stew" considers strange fare from the past, such as a menu from a medieval royal feast in England (14 oxen and 50 swans, among other things), the rat stew eaten by sailors, and the robins popular in Colonial America. "If You Think That's Sick, Look in Your Fridge" takes a look at how many common edibles, such as milk, cheese, honey, and mushrooms, are grown or produced. Each double-page spread includes basic facts and lots of interesting trivia written in a wacky, off-the-wall style that children will love. There are also poems-amusing, tongue-in-cheek odes to unusual delicacies (a haiku celebrates sushi). Brace's cockeyed, whimsical illustrations, done with colored pencils and acrylic paints, are delightful. The pages are filled with colorful characters who make wry observations about the text.

It was the culmination of nearly twenty years of resistance against an occupying force that sought to crush a vibrant, complex civilization and replace it with the laws, taxes and slavery of the Roman Empire. Gloriously imagined, BOUDICA: DREAMING THE EAGLE recreates the beginnings of a story so powerful its impact has survived through the ages, recounting the journey to adulthood of Breaca, who at twelve kills her first warrior, and her sensitive, skilful half-brother Ban, who carries with him a vision of the future that haunts his waking hours. In the company of a supreme storyteller, the reader is plunged into the unforgettable world of tribal Britain in the years before the Romans came: a twilight world of Dreamers and the magic of the gods; a world where horses and dogs and the landscape itself become characters in their own right; where warriors fight for honour as much as victory. Above all, it is a world of passion and courage and spectacular, heart-felt heroism pitched against overwhelming odds.

Her reimagining of this age, when the tribes of Britain clashed with the legions of Rome, includes interior monologues, multiple points of view, dreams, visions, ecstasies, and interlocutions with the dead, all of it utterly convincing and compelling. . . .

She longs to be a Dreamer, a mystical leader who can foretell the future, but having killed the man who has attacked and killed her mother, she has proven herself a warrior. <b>Dreaming the Eagle</b> is also the story of the two men Boudica loves most: Caradoc, outstanding warrior and inspirational leader; and B�n, her half-brother, who longs to be a warrior, though he is manifestly a Dreamer, possibly the finest in his tribe&#x2019;s history.

Russell accepts and Stewart vows revenge. The lion's share of <i>The Best Laid Plans</i> revolves around the young pol's rise to power and Stewart's byzantine plotting to bring him to grief. Russell gives his phony wife plenty of opportunities because, like every fictional president (and some real ones), Russell has an unruly libido. Reading this book is like waiting for a train wreck, bracing for the inevitable collision; but to Sheldon's credit, the titanic scandal that ends the novel is not quite what you expect...HE WANTED POWER. SHE WANTED REVENGE.<p>Dear Diary: This morning I met the man I am going to marry. That declaration sets Leslie Stewart on a destiny she could never have imagined. For she is engaged to Oliver Russell, a man fated to rise to the pinnacle of world power, the office of the President of the United States. And, in the aftermath of the shattering betrayal that follows, Leslie will amass her own towering media empire, dedicated to a single purpose -- the downfall of Oliver Russell, on the eve of his most dazzling triumph. From Sidney Sheldon, the unchallenged master of bestselling fiction, comes a story of blazing ambitions and thwarted love that enthralls and surprises with every page....</p></p><h2>Death in Dark Blue (A Writer&#39;s Apprentice Mystery)</h2><p><b>An aspiring suspense author finds herself writing mysteries by day and solving them by night in the second Writer&#x2019;s Apprentice Mystery by the author of <i>A Dark and Stormy Murder</i> and the Undercover Dish Mysteries.</b><br><br><i>In the quaint town of Blue Lake, Indiana, Lena London is settling into her dream job, but someone is making her life a nightmare...</i><br><br>Things are beginning to go right for Lena.

From the mythical monstrous races of the ancient world to the murderous cyborgs of our day, monsters have haunted the human imagination, giving shape to the fears and desires of their time. And as long as there have been monsters, there have been attempts to make sense of them, to explain where they come from and what they mean. This book collects the best of what contemporary scholars have to say on the subject, in the process creating a map of the monstrous across the vast and complex terrain of the human psyche.</p><p>Editor Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock prepares the way with a genealogy of monster theory, traveling from the earliest explanations of monsters through psychoanalysis, poststructuralism, and cultural studies, to the development of monster theory per se&#x2014;and including Jeffrey Jerome Cohen&#x2019;s foundational essay &#x201c;Monster Theory (Seven Theses),&#x201d; reproduced here in its entirety. There follow sections devoted to the terminology and concepts used in talking about monstrosity; the relevance of race, religion, gender, class, sexuality, and physical appearance; the application of monster theory to contemporary cultural concerns such as ecology, religion, and terrorism; and finally the possibilities monsters present for envisioning a different future.&nbsp;</p><p>Including the most interesting and important proponents of monster theory and its progenitors, from Sigmund Freud to Julia Kristeva to J.

Arising at Columbia University in 2000 from roots in the humanities and patient-centered care, narrative medicine draws patients, doctors, nurses, therapists, and health activists together to re-imagine a health care based on trust and trustworthiness, humility, and mutual recognition.<br><br>Over a decade of education and research has crystallized the goals and methods of narrative medicine, leading to increasingly powerful means to improve the care that patients receive. The methods described in this book harness creativity and insight to help the professionals in being with patients, not just to diagnose and treat them but to<br>bear witness to what they undergo. Narrative medicine training in literary theory, philosophy, narrative ethics, and the creative arts increases clinicians' capacity to perceive the turmoil and suffering borne by patients and to help them to cohere or endure the chaos of illness.<br><br>Narrative medicine has achieved an international reputation and reach. Many health care settings adopt methods of narrative medicine in teaching and practice. Through the Master of Science in Narrative Medicine graduate program and health professions school curricula at Columbia University, more and more clinicians and scholars have obtained the rigorous training necessary to practice and teach narrative medicine. This text is offered to all who seek the opportunity for disciplined training in narrative medicine. By clearly articulating our principles and practice, this book provides the standards of the field for those who want to join us in seeking authenticity, recognition, affiliation, and justice in a narrative health care.<br></p><p><br>Rita Charon is a general internist and literary scholar at Columbia University who originated the field of narrative medicine and directs the Program in Narrative Medicine at Columbia.

But this illusion, acted out by the people who have lived through it in reality, is the unchaining of life. . . .<br>This mad passion, this unfolding of life in the domain of illusion, does not work like a renewal of suffering, rather it confirms the rule: every true second time is the liberation from the first. One gains towards his own life, towards all one has done and does, the point of view of the creator&#x2015;the experience of the true freedom, the freedom from his own nature. . . . Every living figure denies and resolves itself through psychodrama. . . . One speaks, eats, drinks, procreates, sleeps, is awake, writes, fights, quarrels, earns, loses, even dies a second time in psychodramatic ways. But the same pain does not affect the player and spectator as pain, the same want does not affect him as want, the same thought does not affect him as thought. It is painless, consciousless, thoughtless, deathless. . . . It is the self-produced and self-created recurrence of itself.</p> <p><br>&#x2015;J. L. Moreno<br>Psychodrama, Volume 1</p> <p><br>Psychodrama uses action and role play as a means to study behavior in its concrete form. The therapeutic stage allows for the natural condensations and expansions of time that exist in both the conscious and unconscious mind to emerge into the therapeutic moment. On the living stage our worlds can be produced in a manner that more closely imitates the way in which they are stored in our surplus reality. Psychodrama accesses that part of us that, though invisible, provides the script from which we live&#x2015;our psychological and emotional world, with all of its uniquely personal meaning, logic and significance. The world that drives and defines us. <br><br>In psychodrama we 'unchain the illusion.' The usual instruction in psychodrama is 'show me, don't tell me.' Psychodrama as a method of action uses the body in situ to warm up to the contents of the mind and heart. It differs from talking methods not so much in its theoretical approach but in its use of action or role play, in addition to words, to tell a story. Indeed, many therapeutic approaches&#x2015;psychoanalysis, object relations, trauma and grief theory, self psychology, and some cognitive/behavioral approaches, to name a few&#x2015;fit tongue-and-groove as a theoretical base for the flexible, action method of psychodrama. Psychodrama's genius is its recognition that in order to find the right words we have to find the right feeling, and in order to find the right feeling we may need to gently reenter in body as well as mind, the time and space in which that feeling was germinated.<br><br>Psychodrama might also be seen as 'the royal road' to right-brain functioning. The right brain plays a central role in organizing the psychobiological processes that underlie a number of vital functions that occur beneath levels of awareness. The control of vital functions that support survival and enable the organism to cope with stressors (Wittling and Schweiger 1993), the storage of early attachment experiences and internal working models that encode strategies of affect regulation and guide the individual in his interaction with others (Schore 1994), the processing of socioemotional information that is meaningful to the individual (Schore 1998), the ability to empathize with the emotional states of other human beings (Voeller 1986, Schore 1996) . . . the cerebral representation of one's own past and the activation of autobiographical memory (Fink et al., 1996), the �establishment of a 'personally relevant universe' (Van Lancker 1991), and the capacity to self-reflect and 'mentally travel through time' (Wheeler et al., 1997). These basic coping mechanisms reflect the right mind's essential role in primary process cognition and affective and motivational phenomena. It is undoubtedly true that adaptive internal and external functioning involves the activation of both left and right brain processes. Freud felt that centrality of unconscious processes in everyday pointed to the fact that the right brain is 'dominant' in humans, and that the most fundamental problems of human existence cannot be understood without addressing this primordial realm' (Schore 2004).<br><br>One recognizes in the previous paragraph the qualities that are part of psychodrama, along with why it is a method that integrates right and left brain functioning. Simply put, it accesses right brain functioning and the left brain makes conscious sense out of the material that emerges. Through role play, one can recreate one's 'personally relevant universe,' tap into 'early attachment experiences and internal working models that encode strategies of affect regulation and guide the individual in his actions toward others' and concretize 'socioemotional information that is meaningful to the individual' and train people to 'empathize with the emotional states of other human beings' and expand the client's ability to 'self-reflect' and 'mentally travel through time.'</p> <p><br><strong>The Fully Articulated Self</strong></p> <p><br>Recent studies reveal that our neural patterning is set up through myriad tiny interactions. The child, in conjunction with his or her primary care�takers, lays down a psychological and emotional template that gets built on throughout his or her life. This seems to be a phenomenon that continues to occur throughout life but is especially pronounced in childhood when the child's brain and body are in a rapid state of development. Each tiny interaction between child and caretaker affects the child's neural wiring, which is also part of the limbic system. Nature and nurture are exquisitely intertwined within the development of the growing child. And this seemingly personal imprint is, in part at least, relational. Accordingly, our limbic system is the part of our body/brain that has primary jurisdiction over our emotional selves. Altering deep emotional patterns is slow and painstaking work. Limbic bonds imprint themselves onto our emotional systems. The limbic system 'sets the mind's emotional tone, filters external events through internal states (creates emotional coloring), tags events as �internally important, stores highly charged emotional memories, modulates motivation, controls appetite and sleep cycles, promotes bonding and directly processes the sense of smell and modulates libido' (Amen 1998). Childhood imprints lay down a foundation for how we process our emotions that we work from throughout our lives. Our neural networks are not easily altered, for 'early emotional experiences knit long-lasting patterns into the very fabric of the brain's neural networks, changing that matrix calls for a different kind of medicine all together' (Lewis 2002). Our emotional life is therefore physical; it imprints itself on our bodies and it is changed through therapeutic and relational experiences. (I'll discuss this further in our chapter on group �psychotherapy).<br><br>We learn through all of our senses, and the quality of our sensory integration affects our ability to process life's experiences in a coherent, emotionally intelligent manner. The more senses that are involved in learning, the more the brain records and remembers. In the case of trauma, the more senses involved at the moment the trauma occurred, the greater the risk for developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. For example, the first responder at Ground Zero on September 11, 2001, is more likely to develop PTSD symptoms than the person who watched the events unfold on television because more senses were involved (Golden 2002).<br><br>Traumatic experiences from childhood, within the home, involve many senses and are powerfully recorded on the brain/body. They also occur at the hands of caretakers who, in relation to children, have the power in the relationship. A pain-filled relationship where there is a power imbalance coupled with reduced access to support from the outside world can set up a traumatic bond. These are the sorts of bonds that tend to recreate themselves throughout life if they remain unexamined. Psychodrama allows for a reversal of that power imbalance by placing the protagonist at the center of her own experience, in charge of the material to be explored. She operates as a sort of coproducer in her own drama and engages in the psychodramatic moment with all of her senses. This allows her to put the pieces of her world together in a more efficient manner, as many of those pieces are not only encapsulated in word but also in body, action and senses.<br>Clients who have been traumatized, who have spent too much time on high alert in a fight/flight mode, have likely experienced some deregulation of their limbic system, which governs moods. For example, they may be physically tight and tense, depressive, anxious, moody, or impulsive. Psycho�drama, sociometry and group psychotherapy allow clients to slowly create new neural imprints, to repattern their limbic system. Traumatized people may view everyday life in black and white terms. They may cycle back and forth between intense feeling states that overwhelm them and a sort of emotional and psychological numbness. As a result, their inner world comes to mirror this pattern, and it gets projected onto their experience of life. Therapy provides a slow remodulation and, over time, can allow them to renter their bodies and their lives. Their hyper-reactivity can slowly calm down and eventually reach a less volatile level.<br><br>Psychodrama allows for a level of sensory, intellectual, emotional and behavioral integration that is the foundation of its unusual therapeutic efficacy and healing power. It incorporates all of the senses along with language, concrete behavior and affect. It provides for an integration of both left and right brain.</p> <p><br><strong>Roles People Play</strong></p> <p><br>The role, according to J. L. Moreno, 'is the tangible form the self takes,' the concrete expression of the living, breathing inner world. By studying the role, we have a way of studying the self, and by working with the role, we have a way of working with the self. Man, according to Moreno, is fundamentally a role-player. 'The function of the role is to enter the unconscious from the social world and bring shape and order into it.' Through working with the roles that a person plays in his or her life, both on the healing stage of psychodrama and in the client's actual life, we have a way to enter a person at a fundamental level and reshape the unconscious. This is, in part, why working through roles goes so deep, because it enters the unconscious and accesses the thinking, feeling and behavior that have developed alongside the role since its beginnings. Psychodrama concretizes, explores, reviews and revises the person in vivo, in all his complexity and power. It strengthens and empowers the self.</p> <p><br>One of psychodrama's fundamental tasks, according to Zerka Moreno 'is to put the client in touch with their own internal healer.' She describes that 'we all must touch the autonomous healing center of our clients no matter which particular approach we use' (Blatner 1987). As part of the psychodramatic method the protagonist is encouraged to make and remake life choices and expand his or her role repertoire by adding new roles, either within the self or in relation to other people, while reducing others. This can facilitate the learning and mastery of new coping skills (role training) and provide a corrective, socially supportive network or a reworking of object relations through surrogates (role repair). All people have a variety of roles that they constantly play. The process of repairing some roles, adding new ones and allowing others to move from the foreground to the background is part of how psychodrama uses role-play to heal. Protagonists can learn self-directed problem-solving skills using their own and their auxiliaries' resources to help solve issues and experience the self-esteem related to task completion. We are all people living within a context, and all of our problems cannot be adequately addressed by looking only at the inner person. We need a method that looks at the social atom of a person, or a concrete representation of the nucleus of the client's relational world. Through sociometry we address the interpersonal aspect of healing as we work to bring a client's social atom into balance and harmony (social atom repair).</p> <p><br><strong>Spontaneity and Creativity</strong></p> <p><br>Moreno felt that man was fundamentally a creator, that our lives suffer when we lose our ability to be creative, spontaneous and in the moment. When we are ruled by fixed images, or cultural conserves rather than the experience of living in the here and now, we lose access to our personal sense of empowerment. Moreno believed, as do certain Eastern philosophies, in the sacredness of the present moment. 'The greatest challenge in life is to be present, in the here and now, and to act' (Hale 1981). The science of action, both psychodrama and sociometry, 'is concerned with the preparation for action (warm-up), barriers to action (resistance), inability to be in the moment and therapeutic methods designed to assist the creative process in life.' The task of action is to explore those life events and situations in which a person has learned attitudes and behaviors preventing spontaneity and creativity.</p> <p><br>Spontaneity and creativity are twin principles of psychodrama. Psychodrama places the protagonist at the center of his own drama. This empowers him to both show and tell his own story, to restore his position as the creator. In embracing the concepts of spontaneity and creativity, and in understanding and stepping into the role of 'the creator,' Moreno's concepts become important cornerstone ideas on which to build a life and a world.</p> <p><br>We are steeped in the scientific, which is one of our great strengths as a society and helps fuel our curiosity and enhance and inform our relationship with life, the world and ourselves. But we need to be more than objective witnesses in life. We need to engage in the spontaneous process of living. We cannot 'Google' our way into self-knowledge; we need a method that will allow us to work from the inside out and the outside in. As we reach, through role exploration, into deeper layers of self, we expand into a new universe&#x2015;the universe of self. And we find, to our surprise, that it is in connecting with the self that we connect with others, and in connecting with both we delve into our spiritual natures and recognize the pulse of life vibrating within and around us. We see what's already there with new and deepened vision.</p> <p><br>Psychodrama believes that 'joy, creativity and laughter are vital to the human experience and as such are to be part of psychotherapy' (Siroka and Gershoni 2004).</p> <p><strong><br>The Warming-Up Process</strong></p> <p><br>Moreno felt that what was learned in action must also be unlearned in action, that in action we can do, undo and redo, thus freeing ourselves from blocks and barriers that keep us from being present in the here and now, that block our spontaneity.<br><br>Each of us has a warm-up to the various activities of our day, a warm-up to going to work or school, to doing written work, to returning home, to going out with friends and so on. The warm-up is what moves us toward action. Some warm-ups can lead toward positive, nourishing action, while other warm-ups might get us in trouble or cause us to go down a less-than-helpful road. 'The science of action begins with the crucial concern of the warming-up process.

They are valued among the great soulwinners of this century. <p>Married at ages 17 and 18, the Osborns were missionaries in India at 20 and 21. In 1949 they instituted the OSFO International Gospel Center-a world evangelism and missionary church organization. Their life commitment: To express and to propagate the gospel of Jesus Christ to people throughout the world. </p><p>Their guiding principle: the top priority of the church is the evangelization of the world. The Osborns have conducted mass crusades in over 70 nations, preaching to audiences ranging from 20,000 to 250,000 nightly and more. They have sponsored over 25,000 national preachers as full-time missionaries, reaching their own unreached tribes and villages. They have published gospel literature in 132 languages and dialects. They have produced documentary films and crusade tapes for public evangelism in nearly 80 major languages. They have provided airlifts and huge shipments of soulwinning tools for gospel missions and workers worldwide. They have furnished vehicles with films, projectors, screens, generators, P.A. systems, audio cassettes and cassette players, and great quantities of literature for evangelism abroad. </p><p>They are energetic and prolific writers. T.L. Osborn's living classic, Healing The Sick-now in its 62nd printing-has been a faith-building best-seller since 1951.

The Lord's Supper. We recognize these church practices. But do we really grasp their meaning and place in Christian worship? Is our neglect of them hindering our communion with Christ? Are we missing the real drama of our salvation? Often the object of debate, the sacraments are likewise neglected and superficially understood. Leonard Vander Zee makes a compelling case that these problems can be overcome when we see the connection between Baptism and the Lord's Supper and the continuing ministry of Jesus Christ, the incarnate Word of God. Founding his discussion in biblical teaching reaching back to the creation narrative and forward to the teaching of Jesus and the apostle Paul, Vander Zee sees the Christ-centered celebration of these sacraments as essential to the renewal of the church. A reappropriation of Baptism and the Eucharist, especially in the evangelical church, holds great promise for healing the rift between the natural and the spiritual, the personal and social, the head and the heart, and between the body of believers and our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us and now lives to make intercessions for us. In <em>Christ, Baptism and the Lord's Supper,</em>Vander Zee not only opens up a Christ-centered approach to the sacraments but also provides guidance on the practical matters that face pastors and parishioners in the pursuit of a renewed and authentic Christian worship.</p><p>Leonard J. Vander Zee (M.Div., Calvin Theological Seminary) is editor in chief for Faith Alive Christian Resources. Previously he served in pastorates in Indiana, Michigan, Iowa and New York. He is the author of <em>In Life and In Death: A Pastoral Guide for Funerals</em> (CRC Publications, 1992) and <em>More Than Words: Prayer as a Way of Life, a Leader's Guide</em> (CRC Publications, 1995). His articles have appeared in <em>The Banner, Reformed Worship, Perspectives</em> and <em>Christianity Today.</em>Given the rise of contemporary worship services not only in evangelical churches, but also in main line denominations, Vander Lee?s book is a must read. Being evangelical and liturgical--in both worship practice and sacramental theology--need not be exclusive of one another, and that contemporary worship need not be completely stripped of all historical and liturgical content in order to be relevant to contemporary society. (Sacramental Life, Summer 2007)<br><br>"Pastor Vander Zee invites evangelicals into a sacramental experience of the Savior they love. This engaging book unfolds biblical and theological teaching in ways that are both challenging and compelling." (M. Craig Barnes, Meneilly Professor of Leadership and Ministry, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary)<br><br>"In <em>Christ, Baptism and the Lord's Supper</em> Leonard Vander Zee offers a gift to the whole church. His marvelous clarity, theological acuity and personal warmth make this book a joy to read. Most of all, he helps us reclaim the worship practices of an embodied faith, the bath and the feast that demonstrate Christ's real presence in a world grown weary of mere words." (Andy Crouch, Columnist, Christianity Today)<br><br>"This insightful analysis from a pastor who practices what he preaches promises to deepen our view not only of baptism and the Lord's Supper but also of our Lord. Just as the eyes of Elisha's servant were opened to see the chariots of fire that encircled Elisha (2 Kings 6), so too the themes of this book can help us perceive the vibrant, nourishing ways that God works through worship. In an age tempted to treat worship merely as a means to other ends, this vision is one that will comfort, challenge and transform us." (John D. Witvliet, Calvin Institute of Christian Worship, Calvin College and Calvin Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Here, at last, is a major primer on the sacraments for evangelicals. Drawing on the wisdom of the Reformation traditions, as well as the wider Christian heritage, Pastor Vander Zee shows us how our worship can be enriched, and God more greatly glorified, through a new focus on baptism and the Lord?s Supper. A wonderful guide to a deeper understanding of 'the visible words of God.'" (Timothy George, Dean, Beeson Divinity School, Samford University, and Executive Editor, Christianity Today)<br><br>"From the ranks of deeply educated clergy Leonard Vander Zee steps forward to testify on the sacraments. He does so with power and beauty that stick in the mind. Absorbing!" (Cornelius Plantinga Jr., Ph.D., President and Professor of Systematic Theology, Calvin Theological Seminary)<br><br>"The new attitude given to baptism and the Lord's Supper among evangelicals is a positive sign of the deepening of evangelical faith and worship. <em>Christ, Baptism and the Lord's Supper</em> is an important contribution to the current trend toward sacramental thinking because it is rooted in tradition and applied to the health of the present church. More than a study, it is a guide for thoughtful action."

Because of its complexity, the Abhidharma has traditionally been reserved only for academic or monastic study; now, for the first time, clinical psychologist Beth Jacobs brings this dynamic body of work to general readers, using practical explanation, personal stories, and vivid examples to gently untangle the technical aspects of the Abhidharma. Drawing on decades of experience as both a therapist and a Buddhist, Jacobs&nbsp;illuminates this classic area of Buddhist thought, highlighting the ways it can broaden and deepen our experience of the human psyche and offering profound insights into spiritual practice.</p><p>BETH JACOBS, PhD, is a clinical psychologist in private practice and a former faculty member of the Feinberg School of Medicine of Northwestern University. A lay teacher in the Soto Zen tradition, Jacobs incorporates Buddhist studies and meditation into her work as both a psychologist and a writer. She is the author of <i>Writing for Emotional Balance</i> (2005) as well as an award-winning<br> column for the National Association for Poetry Therapy."Beth Jacobs has the kind of mind that absorbs Abhidharma information and structure, combined with a lifetime of eloquent writing and clinical skills as a psychologist. The result is a unique treasure of a book and contribution to the study of Buddhism and mind."<br>&#x2014;Sojun Diane Martin, founding and guiding teacher, Udumbara Zen Center<br> &nbsp;<br> "Jacobs' work here is unprecedented: for all of the popular literature on Buddhist thought and practice and its relationship to psychotherapy, no one has yet made the foundational Buddhist psychological sources&#x2014;the Abhidharma&#x2014;available to a non-academic audience. Jacobs is doing just that. The Abhidharma is notoriously difficult to understand, let alone master. But in weaving her personal experiences as a therapist and Zen student into her learned discussion of the Abhidharma psychology, Jacobs makes the Abhidharma come alive.

Oe was ten when American jeeps first drove into the mountain village where he lived, and his literary work reveals the tension and ambiguity forged by the collapse of values of his childhood on the one hand and the confrontation with American writers on the other. The earliest of his novels included here, Prize Stock, reveals the strange relationship between a Japanese boy and a captured black American pilot in a Japanese village. Teach Us to Outgrow Our Madness tells of the close relationship between an outlandishly fat father and his mentally defective son, Eeyore. Aghwee the Sky Monster is about a young man&#x2019;s first job chaperoning a banker&#x2019;s son who is haunted by the ghost of a baby in a white nightgown. The Day He Himself Shall Wipe My Tears Away is the longest piece in this collection and Oe&#x2019;s most disturbing work to date. The narrator lies in a hospital bed waiting to die of a liver cancer that he has probably imagined, wearing a pair of underwater goggles covered with dark cellophane.</p><p></p><h2>United States of Distraction: Media Manipulation in Post-Truth America (And What We Can Do About It) (City Lights Open Media)</h2><p><p><strong>A powerful critique of how manipulation of media gives rise to disinformation, intolerance, and divisiveness, and what can be done to change direction.</strong></p><p>"Mickey Huff and Nolan Higdon emphasize what we can do today to restore the power of facts, truth, and fair, inclusive journalism as tools for people to keep political and corporate power subordinate to the engaged citizenry and the common good."&#x2014;<strong>Ralph Nader</strong></p><p>The role of news media in a free society is to investigate, inform, and provide a crucial check on political power.

The emperor is plotting a conquest of Crispin&#x2019;s homeland to regain an empire. And with his fate entwined with that of his royal benefactor, Crispin&#x2019;s loyalties come with a very high price. </p> <p> And another voyager has come to the imperial city<strong>:</strong> Rustem of Kerakek, a physician from an eastern desert kingdom<strong>,</strong> determined to find his own fate amid the shifting, treacherous currents of passion and violence that define Sarantium. </p> <p> <br> </p></p><p>For whatever reason, Guy Gavriel Kay just insists on getting better and better. <i>Sailing to Sarantium</i> outshone the already excellent <i>Lions of Al-Rassan</i>, and now <i>Lord of Emperors</i>--the stunning second half of the Sarantine Mosaic--somehow surpasses even its predecessors. <p> <i>Emperors</i> picks up the story of the overwhelmed but still tenacious Crispin, now Imperial Mosaicist to Valerius II and thoroughly steeped in the machinations of Sarantium--not to mention being personally entangled in the lives of the emperor, the empress, and now his own queen, the exiled Gisel. <i>Lord of Emperors</i> also sends a new protagonist sailing into Sarantium, an unassuming country doctor who--like Caius--has found himself thrust into a position of great potential and peril, a victim of both circumstance and his own competence and moxie. The two struggle to stay afloat in Sarantium's swirling intrigues, as Valerius prepares for war in Crispin's homeland and unexplained, ghostly fires flicker around the city. </p><p> A touching, literate, and doggedly intelligent book, <i>Lord of Emperors</i> continues to prove Kay's mastery of historical fantasy (Sarantium being a well-researched analog to sixth-century Byzantium under Justinian and Theodora), as he gracefully spins a rich, convincing weave of legend and history. While other fantasy titles might have us imagine our lives as great heroes, Kay leaves a far more lasting impression by celebrating the heroics and passions of ordinary people who possess extraordinary character and spirit. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p><p> <strong>Guy Gavriel Kay</strong> is the international bestselling author of numerous fantasy novels including The Fionavar Tapestry trilogy, <em>Tigana</em>, <em>The Last Light of the Sun</em>, <em>Under Heaven</em>, <em>River of Stars</em>, and <em>Children of Earth and Sky</em>.

But in God&#x2019;s Year 1171, Henry Fitz Empress,&nbsp;second of that name to rule England since the Conquest, was more concerned&nbsp;with the judgment of the Church than History&#x2019;s verdict.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;When the Archbishop of Canterbury was slain in his own cathedral by men who&nbsp;believed they were acting on the king&#x2019;s behalf, their bloodied swords might well have&nbsp;dealt Henry a mortal blow, too. All of Christendom was enraged by Thomas Becket&#x2019;s&nbsp;murder and few were willing to heed Henry&#x2019;s impassioned denials of blame. His continental&nbsp;lands were laid under Interdict and his multitude of enemies were emboldened,&nbsp;like wolves on the trail of wounded prey. The beleaguered king chose to make a&nbsp;strategic retreat, and in October, he sailed for Ireland. There he soon established his&nbsp;lordship over the feuding Irish kings and secured oaths of fealty from the Irish bishops. The winter was so stormy that Ireland truly seemed to be at the western edge of&nbsp;the world, the turbulent Irish Sea insulating Henry from the continuing outcry over&nbsp;the archbishop&#x2019;s death.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;But in the spring, the winds abated and contact was established once more with&nbsp;the outside world. Henry learned that papal legates had arrived in Normandy. And he&nbsp;was warned that his restless eldest son was once more chafing at the bit. In accordance&nbsp;with continental custom, he had been crowned in his father&#x2019;s lifetime. But the young&nbsp;king was dissatisfied with his lot in life, having the trappings of shared kingship but&nbsp;none of the power, and Henry&#x2019;s agents were reporting that Hal was brooding about&nbsp;his plight, listening to the wrong men. Henry Fitz Empress decided it was time to&nbsp;go home.&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;<br><br>Chapter One<br>April 1172&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Dyved, South Wales&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></i>Soon after leaving haverford, they were ambushed by&nbsp;the fog. Ranulf had long ago learned that Welsh weather gave no fair&nbsp;warning, honored no flags of truce, and scorned all rules of warfare. But&nbsp;even he was taken aback by the suddenness of the assault. Rounding a bend in the&nbsp;road, they found themselves riding into oblivion. The sky was blotted out, the earth&nbsp;disappearing under their horses&#x2019; hooves, all sound muffled in this opaque, smothering&nbsp;mist, as blinding as wood-smoke and pungent with the raw, salt-tang of the sea.&nbsp;Drawing rein, Ranulf&#x2019;s brother Rainald hastily called for a halt.&#x201c;Mother of God,&nbsp;it is the Devil&#x2019;s doing!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Ranulf had a healthy respect for Lucifer&#x2019;s malevolence, but he was far more familiar&nbsp;than Rainald with the vagaries of the Welsh climate. &#x201c;It is just an early-morning&nbsp;fog, Rainald,&#x201d; he said soothingly.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I can smell the brimstone on his breath,&#x201d; Rainald insisted, &#x201c;can hear his cackling&nbsp;on the wind. Listen and you&#x2019;ll hear it, too.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Ranulf cocked his head, hearing only the slapping of waves against the rocks below&nbsp;them. Rainald was already shifting in the saddle, telling their men that they were&nbsp;turning back. Before Ranulf could protest, he discovered he had an ally in Gerald de&nbsp;Barri, the young clerk and scholar who&#x2019;d joined their party after a stopover at&nbsp;Llawhaden Castle.Kicking his mule forward, Gerald assured Rainald that such sudden&nbsp;patches of fog were quite common along the coast. They&#x2019;d soon be out of it, he promised,&nbsp;and offered to lead them, for this was a road he well knew.&nbsp;<br><br>Pressed, too, by Ranulf, Rainald reluctantly agreed and they ventured on, slowly&nbsp;and very warily. &#x201c;Now I know what it&#x2019;s like for your wife,&#x201d; Rainald grumbled, glancing&nbsp;over his shoulder at his brother. &#x201c;Poor lass, cursed to live all her days bat-blind and&nbsp;helpless as a newborn babe.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Ranulf&#x2019;s wife, Rhiannon, was indeed blind, but far from helpless. Ranulf took no&nbsp;offense, though; Rainald&#x2019;s tactlessness was legendary in their family. Slowing his&nbsp;mount, he dropped back to ride beside Rainald&#x2019;s young son. The boy&#x2019;s dark coloring&nbsp;had earned him his nickname, Rico, for upon viewing him for the first time, Rainald&nbsp;had joked that he was more an Enrico than a Henry, swarthy as a Sicilian. Rico&#x2019;s olive&nbsp;skin was now a ghostly shade of grey, and Ranulf reached over to pat him reassuringly&nbsp;upon the arm. &#x201c;Horses do not fancy going over cliffs any more than men do, and&nbsp;Welsh ponies are as sure-footed as mountain goats.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Rico did not seem comforted. &#x201c;Yes, but Whirlwind is Cornish, not Welsh!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Ranulf camouflaged a smile, for the placid hackney hardly merited such a spirited&nbsp;name. &#x201c;They breed sure-footed horses in Cornwall, too, lad.&#x201d; To take his nephew&#x2019;s&nbsp;mind off their precarious path, he began to tell Rico of some mischief-making by his&nbsp;youngest son,Morgan, and soon had Rico laughing.&nbsp;<br><br>He missed Morgan, missed his elder son, Bleddyn, and daughter,Mallt, above all&nbsp;missed Rhiannon. But he&#x2019;d agreed to accompany Rainald to the holy well of St Non,&nbsp;even knowing that he&#x2019;d be away for weeks, for he knew the real reason for Rainald&#x2019;s&nbsp;pilgrimage. Rainald had claimed he wanted to pray for his wife&#x2019;s soul. But Beatrice had&nbsp;been ailing for many years, hers a malady of the mind that only death had healed.&nbsp;Rainald&#x2019;s true concern was for his other son,Nicholas, who had not been blessed with&nbsp;Rico&#x2019;s robust good health. Frail and sickly, Nicholas was not likely to live long enough&nbsp;to succeed to his father&#x2019;s earldom, as evidenced by Rainald&#x2019;s desperate decision to seek&nbsp;aid from saints, not doctors.&nbsp;<br><br>Rainald&#x2019;s pain was all the greater because Nicholas was his only male heir. Rico&nbsp;was born out of wedlock, and thus barred by Church law from inheriting any of his father&#x2019;s&nbsp;estates&#x2013;even though Rainald himself was bastard-born. The irony of that was&nbsp;lost upon Rainald, who was the least introspective of men. It was not lost upon&nbsp;Ranulf, who shared Rainald&#x2019;s tainted birth, both of them natural sons of the old King&nbsp;Henry. Neither of them had suffered from the stigma of illegitimacy, though. As a&nbsp;king&#x2019;s son, Rainald had been judged worthy to wed the heiress of the earldom of Cornwall, and Ranulf had long been the favorite uncle of the current king, Henry Fitz Empress.<br><br>&nbsp;Henry would gladly have bestowed an earldom upon him, too, but Ranulf, who&nbsp;was half-Welsh, had chosen to settle in Wales where he&#x2019;d wed his Welsh cousin and&nbsp;raised his family&#x2013;until forced into English exile by a Welsh prince&#x2019;s enmity.&nbsp;<br><br>His Welsh lands were forfeit and his English manors were meager in comparison&nbsp;to Rainald&#x2019;s vast holdings in Cornwell, but Ranulf had no regrets about turning down&nbsp;a title. He was at peace with his yesterdays, and he&#x2019;d lived long enough to understand&nbsp;how few men could say that. For certes, Rainald could not. Nor could the king, his&nbsp;nephew, absent these many months in Ireland, where he&#x2019;d gone to evade Holy&nbsp;Church&#x2019;s fury over the slaying of Thomas Becket.&nbsp;<br><br>Gerald de Barri&#x2019;s voice floated back upon the damp morning air. A natural-born&nbsp;talker, he was not going to let a bit of fog muzzle him, and he continued to engage&nbsp;Rainald in conversation, not at all discouraged by the earl&#x2019;s taciturn, distracted responses.&nbsp;Ranulf listened, amused, for Gerald was an entertaining traveling companion,&nbsp;if somewhat self-serving. The nephew of the Bishop of St David&#x2019;s, he was&nbsp;returning to England after years of study in Paris, and he reminded Ranulf of Thomas&nbsp;Becket, another worldly clerk blessed with great talents and even greater ambitions.&nbsp;Becket had been a superb chancellor, wielding enormous influence because of his&nbsp;close friendship with the king. What a pity it was, Ranulf thought, that Harry had&nbsp;taken it into his head to elevate Becket to the archbishopric. But who could ever have&nbsp;expected the man to undergo such a dramatic transformation? He wasn&#x2019;t even a&nbsp;priest, had hastily to take holy vows just days before his investiture. But once he was&nbsp;Canterbury&#x2019;s archbishop, he&#x2019;d devoted himself to God with all of the zeal he&#x2019;d once&nbsp;shown on behalf of England&#x2019;s king. Henry hadn&#x2019;t been the only one discomfited by&nbsp;Becket&#x2019;s newfound fervor.His fellow bishops had often been exasperated by his provocations,&nbsp;his refusal to compromise, his self-righteous piety. Even His Holiness the Pope&nbsp;had been confounded at times by Becket&#x2019;s intransigence.&nbsp;<br><br>All that had changed, of course, as he bled to death on the floor of his own cathedral,&nbsp;and when the monks had discovered their slain archbishop&#x2019;s vermin-infested&nbsp;hair-shirt under his blood-soaked garments, none had doubted they were in the presence&nbsp;of sainthood. Acclaimed as a holy martyr in death, even by those who&#x2019;d considered&nbsp;him to be a vexation and an enigma in life, Thomas Becket was sure to be&nbsp;anointed as the Church&#x2019;s next saint. Already people flocked to his tomb at Canterbury,&nbsp;seeking healing cures and buying little vials of his blood as precious relics.More than&nbsp;fifteen months after Becket&#x2019;s death, Ranulf still marveled at it all. Was Becket truly&nbsp;a saint?&nbsp;<br><br>He smiled wryly, then, remembering his last meeting with his nephew the king,&nbsp;just before Henry&#x2019;s departure for Ireland. Over a late-night flagon of wine,Henry had&nbsp;challenged him, wanting to know if he believed Becket was a saint.He still recalled his<i>&nbsp;</i>reply. &#x201c;I cannot answer your question, Harry, doubt that anyone can. I do know,&nbsp;though, that saints are not judged like ordinary men. That is, after all, what makes&nbsp;them saints.&#x201d; Henry had reflected upon that in silence, then said, sounding both skeptical&nbsp;and regretful, &#x201c;Saint or not, Thomas got the last word for certes.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Menevia was the name given to the small settlement that had&nbsp;sprung up around the cathedral of St David. Its houses were outnumbered by shabby&nbsp;inns, stables, taverns, and a few cook-shops, for the shrine of the Welsh saint was a&nbsp;popular choice for pilgrimages. Because of its remoteness and the difficulty of travel&nbsp;in Wales, the Holy See had decreed that two pilgrimages to St David&#x2019;s were the equivalent&nbsp;of one to St Peter&#x2019;s in Rome. The cathedral itself was situated just west of the village&nbsp;in a secluded hollow, out of sight of the sea raiders and Norsemen who had&nbsp;pillaged the coast in bygone times.&nbsp;<br><br>The men expected to be accosted by villagers proclaiming the comforts of their&nbsp;inns, the superiority of their wines and mead, the bargain prices of their pilgrim&nbsp;badges. To their surprise, the streets appeared deserted. Advancing uneasily, they finally&nbsp;encountered an elderly man in a doorway, leaning heavily upon a wooden&nbsp;crutch.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Where have all the folk gone?&#x201d; Rainald called out, and when he got only a blank&nbsp;stare in response, Ranulf repeated the question in Welsh, to better effect.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;To the harbor,&#x201d; the ancient replied, hobbling forward a few steps. &#x201c;Sails were&nbsp;spied and when word spread, people went to see.Most pilgrims come on foot, but we&nbsp;do get some who sail from Normandy and Flanders, even a few Frenchmen who lack&nbsp;the ballocks to brave Welsh roads.&#x201d; He grinned, showing a surprising mouthful of&nbsp;teeth for one so old, but Ranulf knew the Welsh were particular about tooth care,&nbsp;cleaning them with green hazel shoots and polishing them with woolen cloth.&nbsp;Flipping him a coin for his trouble, Ranulf interpreted for the others, translating&nbsp;the old man&#x2019;s &#x201c;Frenchmen&#x201d; into &#x201c;English&#x201d; to avoid confusion. It was not always easy to&nbsp;live in lands with so many spoken tongues. To many of the Welsh, the invaders from&nbsp;England were French, for that was the language they spoke. To the French, those who&nbsp;dwelled on the rain-swept island were English. But those descendants of the men&nbsp;who&#x2019;d followed William the Bastard to victory in God&#x2019;s Year 1066 thought of themselves&nbsp;as Norman, and his nephew Henry was Angevin to the core.&nbsp;<br><br>Having no interest in incoming ships, they continued on toward the cathedral,&nbsp;where they received the welcome worthy of an earl, although Gerald de Barri was disappointed&nbsp;to learn that the bishop, his uncle, was away. They were escorted to the&nbsp;guest hall and were washing off the grime of the road when they heard shouting out&nbsp;in the close. Ranulf and Rainald hastened to the window, looking down at a man&nbsp;sprinting toward the bishop&#x2019;s palace. As several canons hurried to meet him, he sank&nbsp;to his knees, chest heaving.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;The king . . .&#x201d;He gasped, struggling for breath. &#x201c;The king is coming! His ships&nbsp;have dropped anchor in the harbor!&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><h2>Europe&#39;s Last Summer: Who Started the Great War in 1914?</h2><p>When war broke out in Europe in 1914, it surprised a European population enjoying the most beautiful summer in memory. For nearly a century since, historians have debated the causes of the war. Some have cited the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand; others have concluded it was unavoidable.<br><br>In <b>Europe&#x2019;s Last Summer</b>, David Fromkin provides a different answer: hostilities were commenced deliberately. In a riveting re-creation of the run-up to war, Fromkin shows how German generals, seeing war as inevitable, manipulated events to precipitate a conflict waged on their own terms. Moving deftly between diplomats, generals, and rulers across Europe, he makes the complex diplomatic negotiations accessible and immediate. Examining the actions of individuals amid larger historical forces, this is a gripping historical narrative and a dramatic reassessment of a key moment in the twentieth-century.</p><p>From the author of the best-selling <i>A Peace to End All Peace</i> (&#x201c;extraordinarily ambitious, provocative, and vividly written&#x201d;&#x2013;<i>Washington Post Book World</i>), a dramatic reassessment of the causes of the Great War. <br><br>The early summer of 1914 was the most glorious Europeans could remember. But, behind the scenes, the most destructive war the world had yet known was moving inexorably into being, a war that would continue to resonate into the twenty-first century. The question of how it began has long vexed historians. Many have cited the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand; others have concluded that it was nobody&#x2019;s fault. But David Fromkin&#x2013;whose account is based on the latest scholarship&#x2013;provides a different answer. He makes plain that hostilities were commenced deliberately. <br><br>In a gripping narrative that has eerie parallels to events in our own time, Fromkin shows that not one but two wars were waged, and that the first served as pretext for the second. Shedding light on such current issues as preemptive war and terrorism, he provides detailed descriptions of the negotiations and incisive portraits of the diplomats, generals, and rulers&#x2013;the Kaiser of Germany, the Czar of Russia, the Prime Minister of England, among other key players. And he reveals how and why diplomacy was doomed to fail.<br><i> </i><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>David Fromkin is University Professor and Professor of History at Boston University.

It was the age of McCarthy and Suze was an outsider in her neighborhood and at school. She found solace in poetry, art, and music&#x2014;and in Greenwich Village, where she encountered like-minded and politically active friends. One hot July day in 1961, Suze met Bob Dylan, then a rising musician, at a concert at Riverside Church. She was seventeen, he was twenty; they were both vibrant, curious, and inseparable. During the years they were together, Dylan transformed from an obscure folk singer into an uneasy spokesperson for a generation.<br><br><i>A Freewheelin&#x2019; Time</i> is a hopeful, intimate memoir of a vital movement at its most creative. It captures the excitement of youth, the heartbreak of young love, and the struggles for a brighter future in a time when everything seemed possible.</p></p><p><b>Suze Rotolo </b>(aka Susan) is an artist who lives in New York City with her family.<b>Portrait</b><br>In the 1960s Bobby wore a black corduroy cap, with the snap on the brim undone, over his head of curly khaki-colored hair. His clothes were sloppy and didn&#x2019;t fit his body well. He wore shirts in drab colors, chinos and chunky boots, which later gave over to slimmer-fitting jeans and cowboy boots. I slit the bottom seams on his jeans and sewed in an inverted &#x201c;U&#x201d; from an older pair so they would slide over his boots. He is wearing them on the cover of the <i>Another Side of Bob Dylan</i> album. My solution was a precursor of the bell-bottoms that came on the market not too long afterward.<br><br>He had baby fat, and Dave Van Ronk, already a well-known folk musician dubbed the Mayor of MacDougal Street, loved to tease him about the way he looked. As a folksinger, he advised, Bob had to develop and present an image to the outside world, his future public. Such things might have been talked about in jest, but in truth they were taken quite seriously. Much time was spent in front of the mirror trying on one wrinkled article of clothing after another, until it all came together to look as if Bob had just gotten up and thrown something on. Image meant everything. Folk music was taking hold of a generation and it was important to get it right, including the look&#x2014;be authentic, be cool, and have something to say. That might seem na�ve in comparison with the commercial sophistication and cynicism of today, but back then it was daring, underground, and revolutionary. We believed we could change perceptions and politics and the social order of things. We had something to say and believed that the times would definitely change.<br><br>Bobby had an impish charm that older women found endearing, though my mother was immune. He was aware of it and used it when he could. But in general he was shy around people. He had a habit of pumping the air with his knees, a kind of marching in place, whether standing or sitting&#x2014;all jumpy. Onstage he did it in time to the music. He looked good, despite his floppy clothes. He had a natural charisma, and people paid attention to him.<br><br>At the height of his Woody Guthrie phase, he talked through his teeth and when he laughed he would toss back his head and make a cracking <i>ha ha</i> sound or a small <i>ha</i>, with fingers covering his mouth. His walk was a lurch in slow motion. He had a touch of arrogance, a good dose of paranoia, and a wonderful sense of the absurd.<br><br>It was very important t him at that time t write as he spoke. Writin like speech an without havin any punctuation or t write out the word to.<br><br>We got on really well, though neither one of us had any skin growing over our nerve endings. We were both overly sensitive and needed shelter from the storm. But Bobby was also tough and focused, and he had a healthy ego. The additional ingredients protected the intense sensitivity. As an artist he had what it took to become a success.<br>We hadn&#x2019;t been together long when we went to Philadelphia with Dave Van Ronk and his wife, Terri Thal, for a gig she had booked for the two of them at a coffeehouse. When Bobby got up on the stage, he stood straight with his head slightly back and his eyes nowhere and began to sing &#x201c;Dink&#x2019;s Song,&#x201d; a traditional ballad I had heard sung before by others. I watched him as he sang:<br>If I had wings like Nora&#x2019;s dove<br>I&#x2019;d fly &#x2019;cross the river to the one I love<br>Fare thee well oh honey,<br>Fare thee well<br>He started slow, building the rhythm on his guitar. Something about him caught my full attention.<br><br>He pushed out the lyrics as he hit the strings with a steady, accelerating drumlike beat. The audience slowed their chattering; he stilled the room. It was as though I had never heard the song before. He stilled my room, for sure.<br><br>In those early years Bob Dylan was a painter searching for his palette. He had in mind the pictures he wanted to paint; he just needed to find the right color mix to get him there. He savored all that was put before him, dabbing his brush here and there, testing, testing, adding new layers and scraping old ones away until he got what he wanted. He would delve into ideas&#x2014;latch on to them with incredible intensity and deliberate their validity. He had an uncanny ability to complicate the obvious and sanctify the banal&#x2014;just like a poet. Some hated that about him because they felt he was putting them on, scrambling their brains, which he was. It was his way of examining and investigating what was on his mind. It worked for me, even when he made me nuts at times, because I liked to ponder other possibilities too, to find the bit that made a thing that was smooth suddenly produce a bump.<br><br>One evening we went to Emilio&#x2019;s on Sixth Avenue and Bleecker Street, a restaurant that was a fixture&nbsp;in what was then still an Italian neighborhood. It had a lovely outdoor garde in the back that compensated for the stereotypical food. Bobby was all fired up about the&nbsp; concept of freedom. What defined the essence of freedom?<br><br>Were birds really free? he&nbsp;asked. They are chained to the sky, he said, where they are compelled to fly. So&nbsp;are they truly free?<br><b>Folk City</b><br>Long ago, when New York City was affordable, people who felt they didn&#x2019;t fit into the mainstream could take a chance and head there from wherever they were. Bob Dylan came east from Minnesota in the winter of 1961 and made his way downtown to Greenwich Village. Like countless others before him, he came to shed the constricted definition of his birthplace and the confinement of his past.<br><br>I first saw Bob at Gerde&#x2019;s Folk City, the Italian bar and restaurant cum music venue on the corner of Mercer and West Fourth Streets, one block west of Broadway and a few blocks east of Washington Square Park. Bob was playing back-up harmonica for various musicians and as a duo with another folksinger, Mark Spoelstra, before he played sets by himself. Mark played the twelve string guitar and had a melodious singing voice. Bob&#x2019;s raspy voice and harmonica added a little dimension to the act. Their repertoire consisted of traditional folk songs and the songs of Woody Guthrie. They weren&#x2019;t half bad. Bob was developing his image into his own version of a rambling troubadour, in the Guthrie mode.<br><br>Before I actually met Bob I was sitting with my friend Pete Karman at the bar one night at Gerde&#x2019;s watching Bobby and Mark Spoelstra play. Pete was a journalist at the New York Mirror. Back then there were seven dailies, as I recall, and the Mirror was right up there with the best of the tabloids.<br><br>Pete was a fellow red-diaper baby, as the offspring of Communists were called, who lived in Sunnyside, Queens, where I&#x2019;d been born. He had gone through traumatic times, his parents having been jailed during the McCarthy era. His father was a Yugoslav seaman who had jumped ship as a young man. Left without papers, he also couldn&#x2019;t get any because he had been born in Austria-Hungary, a nation that went out of business after World War I.<br><br>Pete&#x2019;s parents were involved with other Yugoslavs in the American Communist Party when a woman they knew informed on them. They were jailed for about six months under threat of deportation, although there was no country that would take them. Shortly after their release, Pete&#x2019;s father died of a heart attack. Pete, a junior high school student, was home alone when two policemen rang his doorbell to give him the news. A few years later he met my older sister, Carla, and they became close friends. During those years he spent a lot of time at our Queens apartment talking politics with my mother and soon was part of the family. When I was living by myself at seventeen, house-sitting an apartment in the Village, my mother delegated Pete to be my surrogate guardian and asked him to keep an eye on me. I had been living pretty much without any parental supervision since my own father had died three years earlier, but since Pete took me into bars I saw no need to chafe at his guardianship. In those days the legal drinking age in New York was eighteen. Underage girls could get into bars without being carded as long as an older guy accompanied them: Pete was my passport to legality.<br><br>That night, Pete was going on about something, in his gregarious way, and commented on a woman with a good pair of legs. In response, I pointed to Mark Spoelstra up on the stage and said, That cute guy up there has a nice pair of shoulders. Pete turned it into a running joke, pointing to guys and asking me what I thought of their shoulders. Not as nice as Mark&#x2019;s, I&#x2019;d reply. He has a real nice set.<br><br>When Bob and Mark left the stage Pete called out: Hey, Mark Shoulders, come meet Suze. She says you&#x2019;re cute.<br><br>I was embarrassed and Mark looked confused. A natural storyteller, Pete often told the tale for laughs, until eventually it ended up revised and expanded in several books about Bob Dylan.<br>In those years Little Italy extended into the streets of Greenwich Village below Washington Square Park and Gerde&#x2019;s was a hangout for local Italians, stray musicians, and Village types. Mike Porco owned it and ran the place with his brothers. Mike was a warm, generous man, and if his English wasn&#x2019;t perfect his instincts were. He knew a good thing when he saw it, whether it was a struggling musician or a business deal and he was always ready to give someone a chance. I&#x2019;m sure Mike knew I was underage, yet when he found out I could draw he let me try my hand at making the fliers that advertised the performance schedule and I joined the ranks of his rotating stable of fledgling artists. One of his younger brothers who tended bar spoke very little English, but he had the vocabulary he felt went with his job. Looking at me meaningfully one night as he topped a drink with a maraschino cherry, he said, Girls gotta guard their cherries.<br><br>I learned about Gerde&#x2019;s history as a folk music club from the inimitable music man and raconteur, Dave Van Ronk. Dave always knew the story behind everything, and could tell it with the veracity and aplomb required to effectively eliminate other versions.<br><br>Sometime around 1959, Israel &#x201c;Izzy&#x201d; Young and a friend approached Mike Porco about making Gerde&#x2019;s into a club for folk music. They wanted to call it The Fifth Peg (as in the fifth peg on a banjo). Mike wasn&#x2019;t aware of the growing popularity of folk music, but he was game to try something that would improve business. He did have music in the bar now and then, some jazz or blues musicians and the occasional accordion player. It never hurt, so he said sure.<br><br>The verbal agreement was simple: Izzy and his partner would charge an entry fee and out of that they would pay the performers and for publicity, while Mike would keep the profits from the sale of drinks and food. Mike couldn&#x2019;t lose, but it wasn&#x2019;t a winning deal for Izzy. Word spread that there was a bar in the Village that featured live folk music, and people started coming to listen. Soon Gerde&#x2019;s evolved into a destination.<br><br>The disastrous finances made it inevitable that others more savvy in the ways of running a club would ease Izzy out. The Fifth Peg reverted to its original name of Gerde&#x2019;s, to which Mike added Folk City, but most people just called it Gerde&#x2019;s. (The origin of the name Gerde&#x2019;s Bar and Restaurant goes back to the 1950s, when Mike bought what was then a hangout for local factory workers. He never changed the name.)<br><br>Since Izzy Young didn&#x2019;t specialize in hanging out, drinking, and smoking, he wasn&#x2019;t around much in the evenings. He was the sole proprietor and founder of the Folklore Center over on MacDougal Street, a store that took up most of his time. Izzy sold books, magazines, broadsides, records, guitar strings, and anything else related to folk music and folklore. The store thrived as a gathering place for professional musicians, aspiring musicians, and folk music aficionados, with Izzy as its up-to-the-minute historian and archivist. You didn&#x2019;t stop to talk to him unless you wanted to do a lot of listening. To engage with Izzy meant entering his universe, listening to his tales, and following his theories wherever they went. He never made much money at anything he did, even though he promoted many events in the world of folk music and folk dance. He was always full of information, ideas, and enthusiasms&#x2014;his interests went way beyond the borders of the folk world&#x2014;but he had no business acumen. No one would dispute that Izzy Young played a significant role in the rise of folk music in the 1960s.<br>Broadway was considered no-man&#x2019;s-land, dividing Greenwich Village from the Lower East Side (soon to be renamed the East Village). During the day, the area around Broadway and Mercer Street was bustling with small manufacturing businesses on every floor of the ornate loft buildings, but after five there was no activity anywhere except on West Fourth Street, at Gerde&#x2019;s. Most of the coffeehouses and other music clubs were farther west on MacDougal and Bleecker Streets.<br><br>The entrance to Gerde&#x2019;s opened onto a small vestibule with another door that led into the place proper. The bar was straight ahead. Just to the left of the door, past a dividing wall maybe four and a half feet high, was a small elevated stage against the back wall. Directly in front of the stage were the tables and chairs with waiter service. The dividing wall continued opposite the bar, and customers t here could lean over it and watch the show, drinks in hand. Sitting on a bar stool afforded a view only of the top of a performer&#x2019;s head. Past the length of the bar was a door leading down a steep flight of stairs to the basement, where the food, booze, and performers were stored.<br><br>If there were more than three people onstage at the same time, it was a crowd. It was fun to watch the bluegrass musicians choreograph their moves. They had to angle their instruments&#x2014;guitar, banjo, and mandolin&#x2014;just so, to be able to come together at the one microphone and sing a chorus, then separate for solos, without a collision. The&nbsp; music spanned a variety of genres that included, besides bluegrass, traditional ballads, folk songs in many languages from many lands, blues, and gospel. Whoever came through the doors and signed up to play could perform at the Monday night hootenannies. Gerde&#x2019;s was on the bar circuit for jazz and blues artists of an earlier generation, from the forties and fifties, artists who&#x2019;d encountered the legendary musicians of the twenties and thirties when they started out.

In 1989, he published an epic poem, "Massacre," that condemned the killings in Tiananmen Square and for which he spent four years in prison. His works include <i>Testimonials</i> and <i>Report on China's Victims of Injustice. </i>In 2003, he received a Human Rights Watch Hellman-Hammett Grant, and in 2007, he received a Freedom to Write Award from the Independent Chinese PEN Center. He lives in China.<br><br>Wen Huang is a writer and freelance journalist whose articles and translations have appeared in <i>The Wall Street Journal Asia, </i>the <i>Chicago Tribune, </i>the <i>South China Morning Post, The Christian Science Monitor, </i>and <i>The Paris Review.<br></i><b>Foreword</b>To hear a new voice is one of the great excitements that a book can offer--and through Liao Yiwu we hear more than two dozen original voices that have a great deal to say. Liao is at once an unflinching observer and recorder, a shoe-leather reporter and an artful storyteller, an oral historian and deft mimic, a folklorist and satirist. Above all, he is a medium for whole muzzled swathes of Chinese society that the Party would like to pretend do not exist: hustlers and drifters, outlaws and street performers, the officially renegade and the physically handicapped, those who deal with human waste and with the wasting of humans, artists and shamans, crooks, even cannibals--and every one of them speaks more honestly than the official chronicles of Chinese life that are put out by the state in the name of "the people."Liao was shaped as a writer by the harshest of experiences: he nearly starved to death as a child and his father was branded an enemy of the people; he was thrown in jail for writing poems that spoke truthfully about China's Communist Party and he was beaten in jail for refusing to shut up; and he discovered in jail the enormous value of listening to others like him whom the authorities wanted to keep forever unheard. So Liao writes with the courage of a man who knows loss and doesn't fear it. There is nothing to make him take notice like an official injunction against noticing, nothing to make him listen like official deafness, nothing that drives him to make us see than the blindness that Communist officialdom seeks to impose. But it is not merely defiance, and it is hardly political polemic, that drives the vitality of the stories in this collection. What makes Liao's encounters with his characters so powerful is the fact that he clearly delights in their humanity, however twisted its expression, and he shows his respect for his subjects in the most fundamental way: he lets them speak for themselves.There is no question that Liao Yiwu is one of the most original and remarkable Chinese writers of our time. It is, however, truer to say that he is one of the most original and remarkable writers of our time, and that he is from China. Yes, his language is Chinese, his country and its people are his subject, and his stories originate from intensely local encounters. But even to someone who has never been to China, and who can know Liao's work only through Wen Huang's translations, these stories have an immediacy and an intimacy that crosses all boundaries and classifications. They belong to the great common inheritance of world literature.Liao Yiwu is an original, but it seems a very good bet that writers as diverse as Mark Twain and Jack London, Nikolai Gogol and George Orwell, Fran�ois Rabelais and Primo Levi would have recognized him at once as a brother in spirit and in letters. He is a ringmaster of the human circus, and his work serves as a powerful reminder--as vital and necessary in open societies lulled by their freedoms as it is in closed societies where telling truthful stories can be a crime--that it is not only in the visible and noisy wielders of power but equally in the marginalized, overlooked, and unheard that the history of our kind is most tellingly inscribed.<i>Philip GourevitchNovember 2007</i></p><h2>Becoming Raw: The Essential Guide to Raw Vegan Diets</h2><p>This book contains a wealth of information on the raw food lifestyle.

Only the attitudes and</i> <i>circumstances of human beings change.</i> When my father was well into his nineties, I walked into his room one afternoon and found him alone, sound asleep. And he was teaching. Even in sleep his words were clearly distinguishable as he chanted Sanskrit verses in the traditional way that sages of India have always taught their students. On this occasion, as I recall, he was reciting the tale of Valmiki, who was seized by a fit of anger when he witnessed a hunter kill a pair of sacred cranes. In his rage, Valmiki started to lay a curse on the hunter, but when he opened his mouth he instead spoke Mankind's first words of poetry. And this poetry was the beginning of the revelations of the <i>Ramayana,</i> the epic poem. That my father, who was widely known as Professor T. Krishnamacharya, should be teaching in his sleep did not surprise me, although I was deeply moved. In those final years of his long life, I knew he was feeling a great sense of urgency. He had amassed so much knowledge that he alone possessed. He was desperate to pass along as much aspossible, knowing that otherwise it would be lost and irrecoverable. Even in dream life, he was never off his teaching. Krishnamacharya's knowledge was legendary. It included languages, scriptures, theological commentaries, astrology, literature, rhetoric, logic, law, medicine, Vedic chanting, ritual, meditation, music, and much more. He had earned the equivalent of seven Ph.D.'s. His learning would have filled many thousands of pages. It would, that is, if it had all been written down. Much of it he had learned in the oral tradition, from teachers sought out in universities of a bygone era, and in places as distant as temples in tropical southern India and caves in the mountains of Tibet. Virtually all of this scholarly accomplishment he had committed to a memory that remained perfectly accurate into great old age. I was always amazed by it, as were visiting students and scholars. For example, he could quote an exact chapter and verse of the <i>Mahabharata,</i> the world's longest epic poem--at 220,000 lines nearly eight times as long as Homer's <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> combined. The knowledge of Krishnamacharya, I should add, might seem not only arcane but also fairly alien to the modern world. He had mastered most of the languages of the Indian subcontinent, and none of the West. Medicine and law as comprehended in the tradition of Krishnamacharya would dismay most of today's practicing physicians and lawyers. His studies had reached back across centuries into the remote past where history fades into myth. This is the realm of the procreators of all Indian science, religion, and philosophy; it is the time of the Buddha, and the age when immortal tales were first written down about fabulous gods, demons, and heroes. Yet, the purpose of my father's erudition was not to preserve the past, but to serve the present and the future. The astonishing range and variety of his studies all combined toward a single end. This was to place the promise of Yoga at the service of humanity, without regard to age, sex, race, nationality, culture, station in life, belief, or nonbelief. Krishnamacharya was convinced that Yoga was India's greatest gift to the world. Part of his genius was to use his enormous learning to reshape the ancient wisdom for modern life. In that sense this most orthodox of religious men was also one of the most revolutionary. He swept aside prohibitions laid down thousands of years ago against the teaching of Yoga to women. To the contrary, he believed that Yoga was even more important for women than for men, in part because it would enhance their health in pregnancy and in giving birth to a healthy child. He also felt that women were the most trustworthy preservers and transmitters of Yogic teaching. My father was a celebrated healer in his own lifetime. This ability, too, owed much to his willingness to adapt past practices to present needs. He demonstrated the contributions that Yoga could make to physical and mental health--to the prevention of disease and recovery from illness. In many parts of the world his practices are currently being used to help victims of asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, digestive disorders, back pain, and a host of other ailments, including mental illnesses and disabilities. He further proved the value of Yoga in sustaining a lucid, balanced mind in our distracting, stressful, and difficult societies. Toward these ends, he experimented and explored ways to refine Yogic techniques to fit the busy routines of modern life. Even the healing and sustaining powers of Yoga, however, were only a part of his mission. The true purpose of Krishnamacharya's teaching was to bring Man into contact with something beyond himself, and far greater. What is Yoga, this gift that promises so much? It is a simple word of vast meaning, subject to many partial understandings and not a few misconceptions. For many millions of people around the world who practice Yoga, it is a kind of physical exercise that involves prescribed movement anddisciplined breathing. This is known as <i>Hatha</i> Yoga. For many, Yoga is identified with types of meditation, such as <i>Raja</i> Yoga, which reaches toward self-knowledge; or <i>Kundalini,</i> the quest for "cosmic energy" and spiritual ecstasy. <i>Kriya</i> is concerned with cleansing, which in extreme forms sometimes appears to be self-mutilation. There is also <i>Tantric</i> Yoga, popularly characterized by its erotic associations. These and other schools have offshoots and variations that, with more or less fidelity to the true nature of Yoga, have their adherents. Before offering a very brief summary of the Yoga taught by Krishnamacharya, let me present more fundamental definitions. "Yoga" is a word from Sanskrit, the original literary and philosophical language of India. The word derives from the root <i>yuj,</i> which has two traditional, complementary meanings. The first is "to bring two things together, to meet, to unite." The second meaning: "to converge the mind." The simplest example from daily life is driving a car. We regulate the gas pedal, turn the steering wheel, while simultaneously keeping (it is hoped) our concentration on the traffic and pedestrians around us. Various movements come together and converge with our attention. Champion racing drivers are likely to be among those familiar with moments in a "state of Yoga," even if they might not call it that. Another meaning may be even more important: "to reach a point we have not reached before." Something that is impossible at this moment becomes possible through Yoga. Today, I sit on the floor and can barely stretch my legs in front of me. After several weeks of practice, I may be able not only to sit erect, but to stretch and bend forward easily, with knees straight, reaching toward my toes. In stages, the impossible becomes possible. At the deepest level, all of these meanings themselves come together. The source of my father's teaching, and the essence of Yoga, was formulated by the great Indian sage, Patanjali, more than two thousand years ago in this succinct definition: <i>Yoga is the ability to direct the mind exclusively toward an object and sustain that direction without any distractions.</i> That "object" can be something as concrete as a work of art, as dynamic as a runner's race, or as abstract as a mathematical formula. It can be as personal and internal to an individual as an exploration of the question "Who am I?" Or it can be as transcendent as being "one with the Lord," whether conceived as a named God or a nameless truth. There are many, very likely thousands, of texts on Yoga, but the other immortal statement of its meaning occurs in the <i>Mahabharata.</i> Like Homer's epic, its theme is a great war, in this case between factions of a divided family descended from an ancient race. About halfway through the poem occurs the most sublime and perhaps the most influential achievement of all Hindu literature, the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i>. It is a dialogue between God, in the form of Lord Krishna, and the warrior prince Arjuna. Arjuna surveys the opposing armies and wishes to withdraw from the struggle, even to die himself, before killing his kinsmen. Krishna awakens in Arjuna the vision of his true self, incapable of death, and calls upon him to fulfill his destiny in the action of Yoga. For Yoga is <i>action.</i> Krishna variously describes it as "wisdom in work," as mastery of the "self-willed, impetuous" mind, as "self-harmony," and as the realization that "the God in himself is the same God in all that is." The battlefield portrayed in poetry is, of course, the eternal struggle of Man's striving toward perfection. It is in that sense that Lord Krishna urges Arjuna: "Be one in self-harmony, in Yoga, and arise, great warrior, arise." Regardless of the religion, revelations require mortal, fallible humans to work out the practical details. This, I believe, was my father's enduring contribution. He was a very practical man, at times even supernaturally so, with an uncanny ability to perceive the human condition. For him, theYoga of Patanjali and the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i> could be made as accessible to each man, woman, and child as their next breath. And it could lead from that moment to unimagined possibilities. Drawing upon the wisdom of Patanjali, my father's teaching was based upon a few <i></i>nshakable premises. He respected, and perhaps even more importantly <i>accepted</i>, that each individual is absolutely unique. Every man and woman is unlike any who ever lived and died in the past, or who will ever be born in the future. Moreover, each individual not only has a unique identity by birth, family upbringing, and culture, but also changes uniquely at every moment of his existence. Given this unique, mutating existence, however, Krishnamacharya believed that all individuals possessed an identical, inborn capacity--an inner temple, so to speak. There, the self might attain a harmonious immersion in the Absolute. What is self-harmony? It is the union of body, mind, and spirit. How is it achieved? Practically speaking, it begins with physical health. Krishmamacharya knew full well that no one strives toward perfection our meditates upon God while suffering a migraine headache, an asthmatic attack, or a wrenching pain of back muscles or bowels. Yet, his view of physical health was that it was more than a feeling of well-being. Health originated in Something greater, inexplicable by even the most advanced biomedical sciences. This might be called the power of healing, and this was very much a question of relationship--whether with a physician, with a teacher, or, above all in my father's belief, with God. In such relationships we are brought to "wholeness." Interestingly, in the English language the words "whole" and "heal" derive from the same Teutonic roots--another hint from the past. In my father's teaching, there is no division between "mind" and"body." Healing lies in the mind, and the Yoga of Patanjali is very much a science of the mind. As the mind draws nearer to Truth, the spirit inevitably manifests. Krishnamacharya once summed it up it in a poem: <i>Where is the conflict when the Truth is known,</i> <i>Where is the disease when the mind is clear,</i> <i>Where is death when the breath is controlled,</i> <i>Therefore, surrender to Yoga.</i> "Therefore, surrender to Yoga ... ." an excellent phrase, I think, at which to pause and engage the reader more directly. I've devoted more than thirty years to teaching Yoga, including many lecture trips to Europe and North America, as well as other parts of Asia. I'm well aware of the range of associations and cautions awakened by ideas such as "the key to healing lies in the mind" and the notion of "surrender." Among students and audiences are those who know nothing whatsoever about Yoga and those who are Masters, just as attitudes range across a spectrum from unblinking skepticism to unthinking acceptance. I may be particularly sympathetic to the skeptics, because I received a Western, scientific training as an engineer, and I've often been among their numbers. No one ever used words more carefully than my father, and no one, perhaps for many centuries, ever breathed such freshness into timeworn meanings. As we shall discover, the idea that the key to healing lies in the mind certainly does not mean that Yoga cures all ailments. You prevent tetanus by getting a tetanus vaccination, and treat serious infections with antibiotics. Yoga works with, not in place of, the great achievements of medical science. And a word such as "surrender" also has a different meaning than may be conventionally understood. For Krishnamacharya, "surrender to Yoga" meant directing all one's will toward achieving independence, an autonomy of mind and spirit. My father's teaching first and foremost was based on the truth that each student must be taught according to his or her individual capacity at any given time. Each progresses in different ways, at different rhythms. And each step is to be experienced for what the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i> shows it to be: an episode in the greatest of all adventures, the eternal quest to discover and fulfill individual destiny. Each person will have a different starting point, but the fulfilling experience of the Yoga taught by Krishnamacharya will utilize five elements. The first, and the usual beginning, involves <i>asana</i>, a Sanskrit term for the physical postures of Yoga. The second element is <i>pranayama,</i> consciously controlled breathing techniques. The third element is chanting, partly for its healing effect on mind and body, and partly because it brings us spiritually into contact with something ancient and sacred. Meditation is the fourth element, a means of opening our awareness both inward and outward beyond our usual mental limits. And the fifth element is ritual, so instinctive and universal a human act--and so widely misunderstood. I attended some years ago a meeting of Yoga teachers and students who were attempting to form an association similar to others that have helped foster the practice of Yoga. The very mention of the word "ritual," however, caused an immediate--and, as it turned out, terminal--uproar. A group of participants would have nothing whatsoever to do with any organization in which the concept of "ritual" was even considered. I gather they felt it meant the introduction of a dogmatic element, which could not be further from the intent of Yoga. The association was thus aborted largely due to the misconceptions surrounding a single word. Others are wary of practices such as chanting and meditation. In this connection, one of the most frequently asked questions is: Doesn't Yoga always lead to Hinduism? The answer: Emphatically not--unless you are a Hindu and wish to draw closer to your religion. Yoga leads to the threshold of the Absolute, which may then be experienced according toeach individual's need or destiny, whether sacred or not. In fact, I am often asked to design meditations for devotees of other religions. I usually ask the students to get approval from their own spiritual advisors, because it does seem odd, say, that a Hindu in Chennai creates a meditation for a Catholic who lives in Barcelona.

Once hunted for their prized fur during the 1700s and 1800s, these animals nearly went extinct. Only now, nearly a century after hunting ceased, are populations showing stable growth in some places. Sea otters are a keystone species in coastal areas, feeding on sea urchins, clams, crab, and other crustaceans. When they are present, kelp beds are thick and healthy, providing homes for an array of sealife. When otters disappear, sea urchins take over, and the kelp disappears along with all of the creatures that live in the beds. Now, thanks to their protected status, sea otters are making a comeback in California, Washington, and Alaska.</p><p>Todd McLeish is a science writer with four published books, all on natural history topics:<i>Return of the Sea Otter</i>,&nbsp;<i>Narwhals</i>, <i>Basking with Humpbacks</i>, and <i>Golden Wings and Hairy Toes: New England Wildlife</i>.

In a warm, knowledgeable tone, Christa Schulte explains all the basics of tantric sex, including how to become more body-aware, how to cultivate pleasure using all five senses and how to practice "Tara-tantra," a woman-centered tantric method of her own creation.<br><br>Exercises form the heart of the book and cover numerous practical strategies for helping women enhance their sensitivity, remove barriers to fulfilling experiences, and explore the spiritual dimension of their sexuality. Not only does Tantric Sex for Women show its readers how to expand and enhance sexual gratification, it promotes an attitude of remaining open to the many ecstasies of everyday life.<br><br>This book contains crucial information for women of every sexual orientation interested in fulfilling their sexual and sensual potential.<br></p><p>The history of tantra is ancient, as is women&#x2019;s practice of it &#x2014; said to date back 3,000 years to the Zami cult of India. Yet, in the many centuries where literature has been produced on the subject &#x2014; and despite the proliferation of contemporary women&#x2019;s sexuality books &#x2014; there has never been an English language book devoted entirely to tantra for women until now. Tantric Sex for Women: A Guide for Lesbian, Bi, Hetero and Solo Lovers, changes that. Filling an important gap, the book addresses all women regardless of sexual preference. <p>The approach makes sense. Women often define themselves by their differences. Yet, all women &#x2014; lesbian, bi, or heterosexual &#x2014; share something primal and basic: the yoni. According to author Christa Schulte, "Yoni is the Sanskrit name for the female genitalia with all its little erogenous parts: clitoris, labia, mons veneris, vagina, G-spot, womb, etc. However, yoni is much more than an anatomical term. It is the holy place of female desire, the lap that births new life, and the praiseworthy location of a woman&#x2019;s deepest power." The book thus speaks to the unity of female experience, while addressing and celebrating multiplicity. </p><p>A long-time practitioner of tantric methods, Schulte introduces a woman-centered form of tantra that she developed herself, named for the goddess Tara, the "Mother of Tibet." Tara, goddess of liberation, personifies the highest qualities of women. She is known for such traits as generosity, compassion, patience, commitment, and assertive action. Worshipping Tara means activating her positive energies and stimulating, healing power. With Tara as a sexual role model, Schulte encourages women to embrace their sexuality and explore its spiritual dimension. </p><p>Chapters 1 and 2 of this guide set the stage by providing relevant context on tantra as it pertains to women. The author discusses: </p><p>--the origins of tantra and its meaning for women in the 21st century --the energy centers, or chakras, and women&#x2019;s erogenous zones --tantric thinking on the variety and diversity of women&#x2019;s orgasms --magic pleasure potions (e.g., aphrodisiacs) --six keys to the gates of physical pleasure --how to arrive at home in your own body </p><p>Following Chapters 1 and 2 are the "fun" chapters (3&#x2013;10) where readers will find 54 tantric exercises to help enhance their sensitivity, remove barriers to fulfilling experiences, and explore the spiritual dimension of their sexuality. Presented clearly, with just the right amount of detail, they are easy to follow &#x2014; and always capture the reader&#x2019;s interest and imagination. Included are: </p><p>--17 games and exercises for individuals --17 games and exercises for pairs --5 massage exercises for pairs --6 rituals of transformation --6 games for the expansion of love energy --3 meditation exercises </p><p>Designed to enrich and liberate the self, promote trust and intimacy, and lead to unimagined ecstatic heights, the exercises are by turns creative and enjoyable, uplifting and profound &#x2014; sometimes even thrilling and naughty! &#x2014; while gently guiding readers through unforgettable sexual and sensual experiences with depth and impact. </p><p>The exercises range widely in tone. Some are rapturous, as with "Female Visions of Joy and "Ecstatic Mountaintop Experiences." Some are adventurous, for example "Camel Ride in Your Own Bedroom" and "Dance of the She-Demons." Others are edgy, such as "Fire Breathing Orgasm" and "Submission Without Ifs, Ands, or Buts." Still others are imbued with a sense of calm, safety, and healing, as with "Pulling Stress Out of Her" and "Self-love Ritual in the Presence of Another." In addition, exercises are tailored to personality types and moods. For example, there is "Breast Massage for the Content, Comfortable Woman" as well as "Breast Massage for the Sensual, Self-Sufficient Woman." Of course, there are also tantric classics, such as the "The Yab-Yum Love Position." </p><p>Finally, the book closes with appendixes and a list of resources. Some of the resources are for further study while others are meant to enhance tantric practice.</p>Many Lesbians criticized, deservedly, the patriarchal, male dominated structures and ideologies &#x2013; that are also coined in the newer western Tantra. So it was, and still is, my desire to reestablish the original meaning of Tantra, namely to be a cult that reveres women and the appreciation and meditative refinement of sexuality. Today, this also requires the corresponding exercises and communication structures, which we cannot translate word for word from the ancient Indian Sanskrit. One example are the rituals that seize the wildness and freedom of the western witch or that contrast the many sexually traumatic experiences that women have with a special kind of tenderness and attentiveness. <p>Added to this is the special reverence of love between women as a further developed form of self-love in a social sphere. This also includes "throwing out" the old ideologies which claim that only a man and a woman can, through their union, create a complete picture. In their place stands the radical assumption that every person, that is to say even every woman, carries within themselves a completeness/perfection anyway. In this way, it has more to do with methods of happily experiencing your own completeness (instead of looking for it outside of yourself), so that these inner riches can then be shared generously with others, rather than depending upon others in your own yearning for completeness.</p></p><h2>Fictions</h2><p>&#39;Nobody before Borges had ever attempted this strange and wonderful mixture of arcana, popular literature, national myth, the nature of time and classical themes. Now we can see it in all its intense and disturbing brilliance, certain that we will never see anything like it again&#39; - Justin Cartwright, &#34;Independent on Sunday&#34;.</p><p>Although Jorge Luis Borges published his first book in 1923--doling out his own money for a limited edition of <i>Fervor de Buenos Aires</i>--he remained in Argentinian obscurity for almost three decades. In 1951, however, <i>Ficciones</i> appeared in French, followed soon after by an English translation. This collection, which included the cream of the author's short fictions, made it clear that Borges was a world-class (if highly unclassifiable) artist--a brilliant, lyrical miniaturist, who could pose the great questions of existence on the head of pin. And by 1961, when he shared the French Prix Formentor with Samuel Beckett, he seemed suddenly to tower over a half-dozen literary cultures, the very exemplar of modernism with a human face. <p> By the time of his death in 1986, Borges had been granted old master status by almost everybody (except, alas, the gentlemen of the Swedish Academy). Yet his work remained dispersed among a half-dozen different collections, some of them increasingly hard to find. Andrew Hurley has done readers a great service, then, by collecting all the stories in a single, meticulously translated volume. It's a pleasure to be reminded that Borges's style--poetic, dreamlike, and compounded of innumerable small surprises--was already in place by 1935, when he published <i>A Universal History of Iniquity</i>: "The earth we inhabit is an error, an incompetent parody. Mirrors and paternity are abominable because they multiply and affirm it." (Incidentally, the thrifty author later recycled the second of these aphorisms in his classic bit of bookish metaphysics, "Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Teris.") The glories of his middle period, of course, have hardly aged a day. "The Garden of the Forking Paths" remains the best deconstruction of the detective story ever written, even in the post-Auster era, and "Pierre Menard, Author of the <i>Quixote</i>" puts the so-called death of the author in pointed, hilarious perspective. </p><p> But Hurley's omnibus also brings home exactly how consistent Borges remained in his concerns. As late as 1975, in "Avelino Arredondo," he was still asking (and occasionally even answering) the same riddles about time and its human repository, memory: "For the man in prison, or the blind man, time flows downstream as though down a slight decline. As he reached the midpoint of his reclusion, Arredondo more than once achieved that virtually timeless time. In the first patio there was a wellhead, and at the bottom, a cistern where a toad lived; it never occurred to Arredondo that it was the toad's time, bordering on eternity, that he sought." Throughout, Hurley's translation is crisp and assured (although this reader will always have a soft spot for "Funes, the Memorious" rather than "Funes, His Memory.") And thanks to his efforts, Borgesians will find no better--and no more pleasurable--rebuttal of the author's description of himself as "a shy sort of man who could not bring himself to write short stories." <i>--James Marcus</i></p>Borges was born in Buenos Aires in 1899. A poet, critic and short story writer, he received numerous awards for his work including the 1961 International Publisher&#39;s Prize (shared with Samuel Beckett). He died in 1986. He has a reasonable claim, with Kafka and Joyce, to be the most influential writer of the 20th Century. Andrew Hurley is Professor of English at the University of Puerto Rico in San Juan. He has translated works by Borges, Padilla and Arenas.</p><h2>Information for Foreigners: Three Plays</h2><p>One of Latin America's most important and prolific writers, Griselda Gambaro has focused on the dynamics of repression, complicity, and violence--specifically, the terror of violent regimes and their devastating effects on the moral framework of society. <i>Information for Foreigners</i> is a drama of disappearance, an experimental work dealing with the theme of random and meaningless punishment in which the audience is led through darkened passageways to a series of nightmarish tableaux.

Challenging queer theory&#x2019;s recent emphasis on loss and trauma, Elizabeth Freeman foregrounds bodily pleasure in the experience and representation of time as she interprets an eclectic archive of queer literature, film, video, and art. She examines work by visual artists who emerged in a commodified, &#x201c;postfeminist,&#x201d; and &#x201c;postgay&#x201d; world. Yet they do not fully accept the dissipation of political and critical power implied by the idea that various political and social battles have been won and are now consigned to the past. By privileging temporal gaps and narrative detours in their work, these artists suggest ways of putting the past into meaningful, transformative relation with the present. Such &#x201c;queer asynchronies&#x201d; provide opportunities for rethinking historical consciousness in erotic terms, thereby countering the methods of traditional and Marxist historiography. Central to Freeman&#x2019;s argument are the concepts of chrononormativity, the use of time to organize individual human bodies toward maximum productivity; temporal drag, the visceral pull of the past on the supposedly revolutionary present; and erotohistoriography, the conscious use of the body as a channel for and means of understanding the past. <i>Time Binds</i> emphasizes the critique of temporality and history as crucial to queer politics.</p><p><p>Elizabeth Freeman is Associate Professor of English at the University of California, Davis. She is the author of <i>The Wedding Complex: Forms of Belonging in Modern American Culture</i>, also published by Duke University Press.</p>&#x201c;<i>Time Binds</i> is an elegant book bristling with intelligence and wit.

Elizabeth Freeman forges claims with texture, rigor, relevance, and grace, giving her masterful, original study a voice of unusual tenderness and depth. Clearly, Freeman stands at the forefront of where queer theory needs to go: into the strangeness, the utter queerness, lying inside the beats of time.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Kathryn Bond Stockton</b>, author of <i>The Queer Child, or Growing Sideways in the Twentieth Century</i><br><br>&#x201c;Positive but not celebratory, exploratory but rigorous, grounded in the messy referentiality of bodies and texts but compellingly speculative, <i>Time Binds</i> is a pathbreaking book that will have multifarious impacts upon queer and feminist studies.&#x201d;<br> (Guy Davidson <i>Australian Feminist Studies</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Despite the queer academy&#x2019;s distance from corporeality and the promotion of more transcendental approaches to historiography, Freeman boldly outlines history as an erotic, embodied experience. . . . Without cleansing their hands of the complicatedness of history&#x2019;s racial legacies, these theorists explore the messiness of queerness. Freeman&#x2019;s book is centered on queer time and queer history&#x2019;s exciting and, at times, (corporeally) violent moments. . . . Fierce indeed.&#x201d; (Lizzy Shramko <i>Lambda Book Report</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In addition to elegant and radical close readings, <i>Time Binds</i> gives us a way to think about pleasure and temporality in combination. . . . <i>Time Binds </i>provides us with close readings of experimental works of film and literature while simultaneously exposing the political stakes of temporality by foregrounding pleasure and the body on both an individual and collective level.&#x201d; (Amber Jamilla Musser <i>Reviews in Cultural Theory</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In the end, Freeman offers us a queer future in which close reading remains both a practice and a pleasure we might repurpose for our own sexual&#x2013;textual encounters, as well as a method of doing queer history through which we are able to feel in touch with, and touch, the social. For making pining for pleasurable encounters with the past, lingering over texts and bodies, and &#x2018;lesbian&#x2019; sex hot again in a &#x2018;new now&#x2019; kind of way, Freeman&#x2019;s book rightly demands we take pause via the sensory, and the sensual, to feel the queerness in this.&#x201d; (Gino Conti <i>Textual Practice</i>)<br><br>"<i>Time Binds</i> is perhaps the most compelling argument for the ways non-normative relationships with time and history can be particularly generative for queer politics."&nbsp; (Craig Jennex <i>TOPIA</i>)</p><h2>The Cruelty of Heresy: An Affirmation of Christian Orthodoxy</h2><p><p>Ancient heresies have modern expressions that influence our churches and culture, creating cruel dilemmas for today&#x2019;s Christian in the form of error, sin, and various distortions on orthodox faith.

Martin Smith, reviewing for Episcopal Life, Aug/Sept 1994"This book is important reading for ministers and for all who seek a deeper understanding of authentic Christian orthodoxy." --Focus newsletter, May 1994"This book should find a home on the desk of every clergyman and Christian layman wrestling with the truth of historic Christian orthodoxy, not only in the Episcopal Church but in the broader Christian community as well." --David W. Virture, Editor of H.O.P.E. Newsletter"This book argues that the reigning orthodoxies of our day are largely updated versions of cruelly deceptive understandings of Christianity, rejected by the church in the first centuries...It is, in effect, an interestingly written history of Christian doctrine combined with an analysis of the present religious situation, which is both accessible to the general reader and stimulating to specialists." --George Lindbeck, Pitkin Professor Emeritus of Historical Theology, Yale University"...a sound, helpful book on the early heresies and on the remarkable achievements of the ecumenical councils of the fourth and fifth centuries that had to deal with them...a valuable book..." --Don S. Armentrout, reviewing for Sewanee Theological Review"[Allison] blends the learning of a church historian with the experience of a pastor to produce a book that is both intellectually stimulating and spiritually enriching...[Allison uses his] delightful ability to shed light on a puzzling argument by the insertion of a vignette from contemporary life...establishes a clear theological perspective from which to understand the intellectual and spiritual roots of real human problems." --Richard H. Belser, reviewing for Jubilate Deo, February 1994.</p><p>"In this valuable work, we see a theologian-pastor at work." --Donald Coggan, reviewing for Theology, November 1994"Bishop Allison has combined a lifetime of scholarship and pastoral experience in this remarkable, readable work...He vividly describes how the two human tendencies toward self-centeredness and escape from the difficulties of life--both very popular today--always distort the gospel...Invaluable reading for any minister of the gospel, those who are preparing for Christian ministry, and all who seek a deeper understanding of authentic Christian orthodoxy." --Joseph Cardinal Bernadin, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Chicago</p><p>"Enlivened by anecdote, and marked by a willingness to name names, The Cruelty of Heresy should be welcomed as substantial teaching from a bishop worthy of his historic office...He shows that heresy is not only a matter of the mind but of the heart and the will, with disastrous consequences for the moral and spiritual life." --Geoffrey Wainwright, Robert E. Cushman Professor of Christian Theology, Duke University"In a time when many traditional churches are drowning in a morass of new polysyllabic heresies, it is a delight to find this spirited defense of orthodoxy...I hope it will do for this generation what Chesterton and C. S. Lewis did in the first half of this century--make orthodoxy both nourishing and exciting." --David H. C.

One of the survivors who made the difficult winter journey was the painter and reserve officer J�zef Czapski.<br><br>General Anders, the army&#x2019;s commander in chief, assigned Czapski the task of receiving the Poles arriving for military training; gathering accounts of what their fates had been; organizing education, culture, and news for the soldiers; and, most important, investigating the disappearance of thousands of missing Polish officers.<br>Blocked at every level by the Soviet authorities, Czapski was unaware that in April 1940 many officers had been shot dead in Katyn forest, a crime for which Soviet Russia never accepted responsibility.<br>Czapski&#x2019;s account of the years following his release from the camp and the formation of the Polish Army, and its arduous trek through Central Asia and the Middle East to fight on the Italian front offers a stark depiction of Stalin&#x2019;s Russia at war and of the suffering, stoicism, and bravery of his fellow Poles. A work of clear observation and deep compassion, <i>Inhuman Land</i> is one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s indispensable acts of literary witness.</p><p><b>J�zef Czapski</b> (1896&#x2013;1993), a painter and writer, and an eyewitness to the turbulent history of the twentieth century, was born into an aristocratic family in Prague and grew up in Poland under czarist domination. After receiving his baccalaureate in Saint Petersburg, he went on to study law at Imperial University and was present during the February Revolution of 1917. Briefly a cavalry officer in World War I, decorated for bravery in the Polish-Bolshevik War, Czapski went on to attend the Academy of Fine Arts in Krak�w and then moved to Paris to paint. He spent seven years in Paris, moving in social circles that included friends of Proust and Bonnard, and it was only in 1931 that he returned to Warsaw, and began exhibiting his work and writing art criticism. When Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Czapski was mobilized as a reserve officer. Captured by the Germans, he was handed over to the Soviets as a prisoner of war, though for reasons that remain mysterious he was not among the twenty-two thousand Polish officers who were summarily executed by the Soviet secret police. Czapski described his experiences in the Soviet Union in several books: <i>Memories of Starobilsk</i> (forthcoming from NYRB), <i>Inhuman Land</i>, and <i>Lost Time</i> (available from NYRB), the last of which reconstructs a lecture he gave to his fellow prisoners about Proust&#x2019;s <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>. Unwilling to live in postwar communist Poland, Czapski set up a studio outside of Paris. His essays appeared in <i>Kultura</i>, the leading intellectual journal of the Polish emigration that he helped establish; his painting underwent a great final flowering in the 1980s. Czapski died, nearly blind, at ninety-six. <i>Almost Nothing: The 20th-Century Art and Life of J�zef Czapski</i>, a biography of Czapski by Eric Karpeles, was published by New York Review Books.<br><b>Antonia Lloyd-Jones</b> is the 2018 winner of the Transatlantyk Award for the most outstanding promoter of Polish literature abroad. She has translated works by several of Poland&#x2019;s leading contemporary novelists and writers of reportage, as well as crime fiction, poetry, and children&#x2019;s books. She is a mentor for the Emerging Translator Mentorship Programme and former co-chair of the Translators Association of the United Kingdom.<br><br><b>Timothy Snyder</b> is the Richard C. Levin Professor of History at Yale and a permanent fellow of the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna. He is the author of several works of European history, including <i>Bloodlands</i>, winner of the American Academy of Arts and Letters Literature Award, the Hannah Arendt Prize, and the Leipzig Book Prize. His most recent books are <i>On Tyranny </i>and The <i>Road to Unfreedom</i>."This gentle, tenacious, adamantine figure has been far too little known in the West&#x2014;until now. New York Review Books recently published a moving and strikingly original biography by Eric Karpeles,&nbsp;<i>Almost Nothing: The 20th-Century Art and Life of J�zef Czapski</i>; a new translation by Antonia Lloyd-Jones of&nbsp;<i>Inhuman Land: Searching for the Truth in Soviet Russia, 1941-42</i>; and Mr. Karpeles&#x2019;s translation of Czapski&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Lost Time: Lectures on Proust in a Soviet Prison Camp</i>. Together these books document Czapski&#x2019;s physical and spiritual survival during a nightmare era, but, more than that, they re-create an overlooked life, one marked by an exemplary measure of modesty, moral clarity and artistic richness. Moreover, Mr. Karpeles, a California-based painter and art critic, has ignited international interest in Czapski&#x2019;s artwork.&#x201d; &#x2014;Cynthia Haven, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><i><br></i>"The Polish painter and writer J�zef Czapski lived through almost the entire twentieth century as an exception to the rule. A pacifist who became a Polish army officer being deported to a Soviet prison camp in 1939, he was one of very few to survive the Katyn massacre perpetrated by Stalin&#x2019;s secret police the following year....He was both a patriot and a European in the deepest sense, with friends and family connections across the continent. In this year&#x2019;s centenary of independence regained, a new generation of Poles in a country at the crossroads must decide whether Czapski&#x2019;s vision will also be theirs." &#x2014;Stanley Bill, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> <br><br>&#x201c;<i>Inhuman Land</i> is a gripping and heartrending depiction of the Soviet Union at war in the years 1941&#x2013;43. Equipped with a perfect knowledge of Russian, J�zef Czapski was able to describe the USSR in all its cruel complexity, alert both to the brutality of Soviet power and the generosity of ordinary Russians. Here Czapski reveals himself as one of the great witnesses of the twentieth century.&#x201d; &#x2014;Anka Muhlstein</p><h2>An Introduction to Probability and Inductive Logic</h2><p>This is an introductory textbook on probability and induction written by one of the world&#39;s foremost philosophers of science. The book has been designed to offer maximal accessibility to the widest range of students (not only those majoring in philosophy) and assumes no formal training in elementary symbolic logic. It offers a comprehensive course covering all basic definitions of induction and probability, and considers such topics as decision theory, Bayesianism, frequency ideas, and the philosophical problem of induction. The key features of the book are: * A lively and vigorous prose style* Lucid and systematic organization and presentation of the ideas* Many practical applications* A rich supply of exercises drawing on examples from such fields as psychology, ecology, economics, bioethics, engineering, and political science* Numerous brief historical accounts of how fundamental ideas of probability and induction developed.* A full bibliography of further reading Although designed primarily for courses in philosophy, the book could certainly be read and enjoyed by those in the social sciences (particularly psychology, economics, political science and sociology) or medical sciences such as epidemiology seeking a reader-friendly account of the basic ideas of probability and induction. Ian Hacking is University Professor, University of Toronto. He is Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, Fellow of the British Academy, and Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. he is author of many books including five previous books with Cambridge (The Logic of Statistical Inference, Why Does Language Matter to Philosophy?, The Emergence of Probability, Representing and Intervening, and The Taming of Chance).</p><p>Ian Hacking is the winner of the Holberg International Memorial Prize 2009."While written as an introductory text, it is full of philosophical wisdom. Moreover, this is wisdom that most students of philosophy need but find very hard to acquire. Hacking explains all the basic ideas of probability theory, the philosophical puzzles they raise, the standard lines of response, their strengths and weaknesses. He writes with the authority of someone who has helped form the debates and understands everything properly, but at the same time he gives a fair hearing to all positions worth taking seriously. At some point in the career of most philosophy students, graduates and undergraduates alike, they read stuff, which uses probalistic ideas and turn to their teachers for guidance. I can imagine that the teachers' automatic response for some decades to come will be to send these students to Hacking." David Papineau, King's College, London<br><br>"Hacking's textbook is likely to become the standard for inductive logic courses. He writes simply, in a lively style, without oversimplification. it starts at the beginning, and throughout uses only the simplest calculations. As it goes on, tools including P-values, confidence intervals, expected values, the basics of decision theory, and Bayesianism are introduced with mathematical honesty and refreshing philosophical scrutiny. Lively and original examples drawn from everyday life create the appropriate context to prepare students to think critically about the barrage of statisical arguments that confront us on a daily basis. From Madison Avenue's "4 out of 5 dentists choose..." to highly sophisticated economic modeling we poll and make prophecies based on statistical information regularly. Hacking's textbook sheds much needed light on the mystique reasoning."

Previously an associate pastor at Life Christian Church in St. Louis, Missouri, she developed, coordinated, and taught a weekly meeting known as "Life In The Word." After more than five years, the Lord brought it to a conclusion, directing her to establish her own ministry and call it "Life In The Word, Inc." <p>Now, her Life In The Word radio and television broadcasts are seen and heard by millions across the United States and throughout the world. Joyce's teaching tapes are enjoyed internationally, and she travels extensively conducting Life In The Word conferences. </p><p>Joyce and her husband, Dave, the business administrator at Life In The Word, have been married for over 35 years.

Finding herself in the same situation many years ago and having found freedom to live in victory through applying God's Word, Joyce goes equipped to set captives free and to exchange ashes for beauty. She believes that every person who walks in victory leads many others into victory.

This strategic move on the part of her opportunistic father also becomes a chance for the girl to grow and discover herself. There, and later in France, Anne thrives, preferring to absorb the works of progressive writers rather than participate in courtly flirtations. She also begins to understand the inequalities and indignities suffered by her gender.<br><br> Anne isn&#x2019;t completely inured to the longings of the heart, but her powerful family has ambitious plans for her future that override any wishes of her own. When the King of England himself, Henry VIII, asks Anne to be his mistress, she spurns his advances&#x2014;reminding him that he is a married man who has already conducted an affair with her sister, Mary. Anne&#x2019;s rejection only intensifies Henry&#x2019;s pursuit, but in the absence of a male heir&#x2014;and given an aging Queen Katherine&#x2014;the opportunity to elevate and protect the Boleyn family, and to exact vengeance on her envious detractors, is too tempting for Anne to resist, even as it proves to be her undoing. <br><br> While history tells of how Anne Boleyn died, this compelling new novel reveals how fully she lived.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Anne Boleyn, A King&#x2019;s Obession</i><br></b><br>&#x201c;Superb . . . page-turning biographical fiction, hauntingly and beautifully told . . . psychologically penetrating.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Historical Novels Review</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Immaculately researched and convincing . . .

At eleven she had no womanly figure to speak of, but that hopefully would change in the next year or so. Mary, after all, was already buxom at thirteen.<br><br>She drew back, considering herself. People had often said, within her hearing, that Mary was the more beautiful of the two Boleyn sisters. Yet they were both brunettes, with long glossy hair, high cheekbones and pointed chins, and both slender and graceful, for the deportment fit for royal courts had been drummed into them. So what was it that made a girl beautiful? What made the arrangement of Mary&#x2019;s features better than hers? It had begun to bother Anne, now that she was growing up and was constantly being enjoined to prepare herself for a glorious future in which royal favor and a wealthy husband of rank loomed large.<br><br>Maybe it was the moles and the sallow skin. The sallowness could be rectified by a lotion of powdered egg whites and alum. At least she had a pretty mouth, and the black eyes that her Grandmother Butler always said were her best feature.<br><br>&#x201c;And you know already how to use them for effect, child.&#x201d; Anne had not quite understood what that meant, but then Grandmother was Irish and a little fey and often said some startling things. Everyone tolerated it because she had been a great heiress and one of the chief sources of the family fortunes.<br><br>Anne propped up the mirror on a chest and twirled in front of it. She did look good in the green gown, which made her waist seem so slender. The dark color became her too. The only thing that was wrong was the cut of the sleeves, which were tight to the wrist and did not cover the deformity of which she was always so painfully aware. She was forever curling it into her palm, the little finger of her right hand, so that none should see the tiny extra nail. If only she could have a gown with hanging sleeves that would cover it! But Mother said it was foolish to worry about such a little thing. It was not a little thing to Anne, and it had loomed larger than ever since the day when Mary, bested in one of their interminable arguments, had called it a witch&#x2019;s mark.<br><br>Anne pushed the hateful memory aside. She would not dwell on it on this beautiful late-�summer day. She had a free hour before her lesson with the chaplain, and was determined to waste not a minute of it. In a trice she had summoned her maid, changed into her everyday worsted, descended the stairs and crossed the stone drawbridge across the castle moat; then she picked up her skirts and ran through the gardens into the meadows by the River Eden, where she loved to wander.<br><br>From here she had a grand view of moated Hever Castle, her family&#x2019;s seat, and the lush wooded Kentish countryside that cradled it. But of greater interest was the sight of her beloved brother George lying sprawled in the grass, twanging his lute, his dark brown hair tousled, his clothes crumpled.<br><br>&#x201c;They are looking for you indoors,&#x201d; she told him, kneeling down. &#x201c;You should be at your books. You&#x2019;ll be beaten if you don&#x2019;t go back.&#x201d;<br><br>George grinned up at her. &#x201c;I had an idea for a song. Listen!&#x201d;<br><br>He played well for a boy of nine, and his composition had the sophistication one would have expected from someone far older. He was gifted, this brother of hers. He could make his mark as a musician if he did not carve out a career at court, as their father expected.<br><br>They had always been close, Anne and George. They looked alike and thought alike.<br><br>&#x201c;I know, I know&#x2014;�I can&#x2019;t spend my days making music and writing poetry,&#x201d; he sighed, mimicking Father&#x2019;s voice.<br><br>&#x201c;Much good it would do you! And in the end you would not be satisfied. It would never be enough for you. So stop playing truant. Father Davy is livid.&#x201d;<br><br>For all her mock reproof, she felt sorry for George. She knew how deeply it gnawed at him, being the youngest of three sons. It was sixteen-�year-�old Thomas who would inherit Hever and all their father&#x2019;s lands and wealth&#x2014;�and it was Thomas who, to George&#x2019;s envy, had been sent to the household of the mighty Duke of Buckingham at nearby Penshurst to learn courtly manners and the martial arts, which would befit him for the glorious future that awaited him. And then there was clever Henry, twelve years old and destined for the university at Oxford, since Father had decided to dedicate him to the Church&#x2014;�and save himself the burden of having to provide for him. There had been other sons too, but they slept in St. Peter&#x2019;s Church, to their mother&#x2019;s great grief. Anne had never gotten used to the appalling sight of her tiny dead siblings lying in their cradles, all decked out in macabre finery, to receive the final prayers and farewells of their family.<br><br>Lady Boleyn doted on George, her youngest, more than she did on Thomas and Henry. But in George&#x2019;s breast there burned a fierce resentment against his older brothers. Unlike them, he must make his own way in the world. Father reminded him of it often.<br><br>Given her rivalry with Mary, and George&#x2019;s envy of their older brothers, Anne often felt that it was a case of her and George, the two youngest Boleyns, against the world. Because she did not have looks and he was not the heir, they had pulled together since they were very little. Some took them for twins.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on!&#x201d; she commanded, pulling him up, and together they raced back to the castle.<br><br>Father Davy was waiting for them as they sped across the courtyard and tumbled into Father&#x2019;s new entrance hall. Their tutor was a rotund little man with a merry face and cheeks rosy as apples.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, you&#x2019;ve deigned to grace us with your presence,&#x201d; he said to George. &#x201c;And mightily timely too, for we&#x2019;ve just had word that your father is expected home this evening, and we wouldn&#x2019;t want to greet him with the news that you&#x2019;re in disgrace, would we?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, Father Davy.&#x201d; George was trying to look contrite.<br><br>&#x201c;Mistress Anne, you may join us,&#x201d; Father Davy said. &#x201c;You can set an example to this young knave.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Mary?&#x201d; George asked, rolling his eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;Reading,&#x201d; said Father Davy. &#x201c;I have given her a book on kings and queens. It will improve her mind.&#x201d; It was no secret that he had almost given up on Mary.<br><br>Anne followed them into the private parlor used by the family in the evenings, and sat down at the oak table. She knew she was fortunate, being a girl, to receive a good education. Father had very advanced ideas, but then he was always concerned that his children should do well in life&#x2014;�which, of course, would reflect favorably on him. Accomplished in foreign tongues himself&#x2014;�which was why he had been away these last weeks at the court of the Regent of the Netherlands at Mechlin in the Duchy of Burgundy&#x2014;�he was particularly anxious that his sons and daughters become proficient too.<br><br>Anne struggled with French, despite excelling at everything else. Mary was good at French, but dismal in all other respects. Anne could compose passable poetry and songs, thanks to Father Davy being a famous composer of church music and a gifted teacher. Mary battled, murdering her lute; it did not help that she was tone deaf. Anne danced gracefully; Mary galumphed about the floor. Anne sang like a lark; Mary&#x2019;s voice was flat. But Mary had the looks, everyone said, so it didn&#x2019;t matter that she was an idiot. Most men would not see beyond her beauty and the dowry Father could give her. Thus it did not matter that, when the time for lessons arrived, she was rarely to be found.<br><br>Most of the daughters of the local gentry in the Boleyns&#x2019; circle could barely wield a pen, Anne reflected, as her quill traced her graceful Italianate hand across the paper. Today&#x2019;s exercise was composing a letter in French, which was a challenge, but she was determined to persevere. She enjoyed learning for its own sake, and reveled in the praise Father Davy lavished on her.<br><br>From the kitchens nearby they could hear a great clatter and commotion. The household was preparing for the return of its master, and Mother would be giving orders and inspecting the cooking pots, much to the cook&#x2019;s ill-�concealed annoyance. There would be a feast tonight, Anne thought happily.<br><br>Dressed in the new green gown, Anne stole a peep at the great hall, where the tables had been beautifully laid with snowy-�white linen. The best silver was set out on the high table above the great gilt salt, with polished pewter on the lower trestles set at right angles to it. Banks of greenery trailed along the center of the boards, interspersed with candles and ewers of wine. Hever was a small castle, and the hall not large compared to some she had seen, but it was sufficiently grand for an up-�and-�coming diplomat and favorite of the King, with its great stone fireplace and imposing carved screen. The early evening sunshine cast a golden glow through the tall windows set high in the thick walls, reflecting its jewel-�like glints on the impressive display of family plate on the buffet and the expensive wall hangings. Father liked to impress his neighbors with his wealth. They were all coming tonight: the Wyatts from Allington, the Sackvilles from Buckhurst Park, and the Hautes from Ightham Mote.<br><br>Normally the family dined in the parlor, seated at the long polished table. It was a cozy room, its walls adorned with wainscot of oak and painted friezes, and hung with another of the costly tapestries of which Father was inordinately proud. But that was all familiar and commonplace; feasting in the great hall was an occasion, and Anne was impatient for it to begin.<br><br>Father was home, and she had been summoned to see him in his study before dinner. There he sat, in his high carved chair, nodding as she made her curtsey: the man who had dominated her life for as long as she could remember, whose lightest word was law to his family and servants, and to whom Anne and her brothers and sister had been brought up to render unconditional obedience. When she and Mary married, their husbands would take over his role. It had been drummed into them both that women were weak creatures and should always be subject to the wise dominion of men.<br><br>When Sir Thomas Boleyn was at home, the household revolved around him, but that was a rare occurrence. When he was not abroad using the diplomatic skills that had so endeared him to King Henry, he was usually at court, building on his reputation as a jouster and courtier and all-�round good fellow. At thirty-�four, he was still a handsome and agile man, and sat a horse superbly. He was outstandingly learned&#x2014;�it seemed to his children that he knew everything&#x2014;�and even the great Dutch scholar Erasmus had dedicated two books to him. Thanks to these virtues he had risen high and fast in royal service, becoming one of King Henry&#x2019;s best friends and jousting partners, and never tired of reminding everyone of it. He had been knighted at the King&#x2019;s coronation, three years earlier, and then appointed Esquire of the Body to the monarch.<br><br>&#x201c;It is a most sought-�after post,&#x201d; he was prone to boasting, &#x201c;for it brings me into daily contact with the King. I enjoy great influence. I have His Grace&#x2019;s ear.&#x201d; He would gleefully expand on the patronage he was in a position to exercise. Anne understood that there were many people who wanted Sir Thomas Boleyn to ask the King for favors, and that they were ready to pay him a lot of money to do that.<br><br>She was pleased to see Father&#x2019;s pugnacious face broaden into a wolfish smile as she rose from her curtsey. &#x201c;I have some good news,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The Regent Margaret was most interested to hear of your accomplishments and has offered to take you into her household as one of her eighteen maids of honor. It is a signal favor, much sought after.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me, sir?&#x201d; Anne echoed. &#x201c;Surely Mary . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know, it is highly unusual for the younger sister to be advanced before the elder, and Mary speaks good French. But,&#x201d; and he gave Anne a calculating look, &#x201c;I believe that you have what it takes to succeed at court and be a credit to me. Besides, I have other plans for Mary. And the Regent specially asked for you.&#x201d;<br><br>Anne felt excitement bubbling up.<br><br>&#x201c;When am I to go, sir?&#x201d; she breathed, envisaging the glorious palaces, the fine gowns, the glittering lords and ladies, the Regent smiling as she made her obeisance with everyone looking on.<br><br>&#x201c;Next spring,&#x201d; her father said, and the bubble burst. That was months away. &#x201c;There will be many preparations to make. Your mother will know what is required. I&#x2019;d rather it be you than the Devil who makes work for idle hands.&#x201d; He and Mother barely spoke to each other unless they had to.<br><br>&#x201c;You must work hard at your French,&#x201d; he went on. &#x201c;You will complete your education at the court of Burgundy. There is no finer place, for it offers many opportunities for a young girl of good birth, and is universally well regarded. You will be well placed to attract a marriage that will advance the interests of our family. I hope you appreciate your good fortune.&#x201d;</p><h2>Lakota Belief and Ritual</h2><p>Provides raw narratives without any pretension of synthesis or analysis</p><p>This volume is the first of four that will present the best and most important portions of the hundreds of pages of notes, interviews, texts, and essays that James R.

There is knowledge only the wild can give us, knowledge specific to it, knowledge specific to the experience of it. These are its gifts to us.<br><br> How wild is wilderness and how wild are our experiences in it, asks Jack Turner in the pages of <i>The Abstract Wild</i>. His answer: not very wild. National parks and even so-called wilderness areas fall far short of offering the primal, mystic connection possible in wild places.

From whatever angle, Turner stirs into his arguments the words of dozens of other American writers including Thoreau, Hemingway, Faulkner, and environmentalist Doug Peacock.<br><br> We hunger for a kind of experience deep enough to change our selves, our form of life, writes Turner. Readers who take his words to heart will find, if not their selves, their perspectives on the natural world recast in ways that are hard to ignore and harder to forget.</p><p>Much contemporary environmental literature names as enemies of the wild corporate agriculture, logging, mining, and ranching. For mountain guide/philosopher Jack Turner, these will not do. He dislikes even more the abstractions that divorce us from the natural world, which cause us to create pseudo-wild locales like Yellowstone National Park and Grand Canyon, places that resemble nothing so much as Disneyland. Wilderness advocates who do not make themselves at home in the wild, he believes, cannot hope to understand the object of their desires, for only from that &#34;complete immersion in place over time&#34; can there arise the &#34;wisdom that cannot emerge from tourism in a relic wilderness.&#34; This sometimes blistering, provocative book is an eco-radical manifesto of a kind, and every reader concerned with wilderness issues should pay attention to it.How wild is wilderness and how wild are our experiences in it, asks Jack Turner in the pages of The Abstract Wild.

The freak-out factor was high.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Don&#x2019;t worry--the rattlesnake couldn&#x2019;t bite. I taped its mouth shut. That&#x2019;s a tricky move, not for rookies. You need steady hands and zero common sense. I wouldn&#x2019;t try it again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The point is I didn&#x2019;t want that rattler to hurt anyone. I just wanted kids to stay out of my locker.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Which they now do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I set the diamondback free a few miles down Grapefruit Road, on the same log where I found him.

Mom&#x2019;s still touchy about the subject, so I try to take it easy. Meanwhile, my sister, Belinda, acts like she doesn&#x2019;t care, like she&#x2019;s not the least bit curious about the old man.

Now, this kid happens to be a dork, no question, but he&#x2019;s harmless. And the lacrosse player outweighs him by like forty pounds. Still, a crowd is just standing around watching this so-called fight, which is really just a mugging. There are dudes way bigger than me, major knuckle-draggers, cheering and yelling.

Roth has uncovered China's oldest mystical text&#x2015;the original expression of Taoist philosophy&#x2015;and presents it here with a complete translation and commentary.<br><br>Over the past twenty-five years, documents recovered from the tombs of China's ancient elite have sparked a revolution in scholarship about early Chinese thought, in particular the origins of Taoist philosophy and religion. In <i>Original Tao,</i> Harold D. Roth exhumes the seminal text of Taoism&#x2015;<i>Inward Training (Nei-yeh)</i>&#x2015;not from a tomb but from the pages of the <i>Kuan Tzu,</i> a voluminous text on politics and economics in which this mystical tract had been "buried" for centuries.<br><br><i>Inward Training</i> is composed of short poetic verses devoted to the practice of breath meditation, and to the insights about the nature of human beings and the form of the cosmos derived from this practice. In its poetic form and tone, the work closely resembles the <i>Tao-te Ching</i>; moreover, it clearly evokes Taoism's affinities to other mystical traditions, notably aspects of Hinduism and Buddhism. <br><br>Roth argues that <i>Inward Training</i> is the foundational text of early Taoism and traces the book to the mid-fourth century B.C. (the late Warring States period in China). These verses contain the oldest surviving expressions of a method for mystical "inner cultivation," which Roth identifies as the basis for all early Taoist texts, including the <i>Chuang Tzu</i> and the world-renowned <i>Tao-te Ching.</i> With these historic discoveries, he reveals the possibility of a much deeper continuity between early "philosophical" Taoism and the later Taoist religion than scholars had previously suspected.<br><br><i>Original Tao</i> contains an elegant and luminous complete translation of the original text. Roth's comprehensive analysis explains what <i>Inward Training</i> meant to the people who wrote it, how this work came to be "entombed" within the <i>Kuan Tzu,</i> and why the text was largely overlooked after the early Han period.</p><p>Revolutionizing received opinion of Taoism's origins in light of historic new discoveries, Harold D.

An intricate fusion of music, dance, mask, costume and language, the dramas address many subjects, but the idea of "form" is more central than 'meaning' and their structure is always ritualized. Selected for their literary merit, the twenty-four plays in this volume dramatize such ideas as the relationship between men and the gods, brother and sister, parent and child, lover and beloved, and the power of greed and desire. Revered in Japan as a cultural treasure, the spiritual and sensuous beauty of these works has been a profound influence for English-speaking artists including W. B. Yeats, Ezra Pound and Benjamin Britten.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

"If Abel has raised the money he must do it quickly, before her owner can change his mind again. You will go with him, of course?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>Robert Granger nodded. They had spoken of this occasion often and had agreed that Robert ought to accompany Mr. Wright south to Virginia, both to share the work of driving the horses and to discourage unscrupulous interlopers. The abolitionist newspapers told of proslavery men who became so incensed at the sight of a newly freed slave that they would seize him and sell him back into slavery. Not even Mr. Wright was safe from their ilk, for all that he had never been a slave. If anything, enslaving him would bring them even greater pleasure.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Uncle Jacob's face bore the grim expression that Dorothea likened to a block of limestone. "You can't think of leaving in the middle of harvest."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Abel needs to leave at sunup," Robert explained apologetically, as if humility would protect him from Uncle Jacob's wrath.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Surely he can wait a few weeks until the crops are in."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"He said he can't. He'll go alone rather than wait for me."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Then let him go alone," glowered Uncle Jacob. "Hasn't he done so often enough to sell that cheese of his?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"This time is different," said Robert. "He will be exchanging a considerable amount of money for the person of his wife."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Wright raises goats. He likely has more goats than corn on his place. He can afford to leave his farm during the harvest. We can't."</p><p></p><p></p><p>Dorothea waited for her uncle to announce yet another visit to his lawyer. The implication was, of course, that he intended to change his will, and not in favor of his only living relatives. Dorothea waited, but Uncle Jacob said nothing more until mealtime gave way to evening chores. As they cleared the table, Dorothea's mother remarked that Uncle Jacob had not expressly forbidden Robert to go, which in his case was almost the same as giving his blessing.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"According to that logic," Dorothea replied, "if I tell my pupils not to put a bent pin on my chair, what I really mean is that I would prefer a nail."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Your pupils have far too much affection for you to do either," said Lorena, deliberately missing the point. They both knew she was putting her brother's obvious disapproval in a better light than it deserved. Dorothea knew her uncle would have expressly forbidden the journey for anyone but Abel Wright. Uncle Jacob had no friends, but he respected Mr. Wright for his independence, thrift, and industriousness, qualities he would have admired in himself if doing so would not have occasioned the sin of vanity.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Uncle Jacob had never declared whether he was for or against slavery, at least not in Dorothea's presence. According to Lorena, Uncle Jacob's long-deceased wife had been a Quaker and a passionate abolitionist, but he never spoke of her and Dorothea had no idea whether he shared her views. Still, she suspected her uncle's objections to the journey had nothing to do with his moral position on the subject of slavery and everything to do with the pragmatics of farming. Despite Mr. Wright's reasonable urgency to free his wife from bondage, Uncle Jacob likely could not comprehend how a sensible farmer could take off on any errand when the most important work of the year needed to be done. Of course, Uncle Jacob knew all too well that his sister's husband was <i>not</i> a sensible farmer. If he had been, Uncle Jacob would not have been obligated by the ties of family and Christian charity to take in his sister's family after they lost their own farm.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Later that night, Dorothea asked her father if she might accompany them, but her father said this particular errand was too dangerous for a girl of nineteen.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"But Mr. Wright has made the trip so many times," protested Dorothea.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"You are needed at home," said Uncle Jacob. "Already I will have to hire hands to make up for your father's absence. I will not hire kitchen help, too."</p><p></p><p></p><p>Even without Lorena's look of warning, Dorothea knew better than to protest. Her uncle had not even looked up from his Bible as he spoke, but any interruption of his nightly devotion was unusual enough to reveal the strength of his feeling on the subject.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Robert left for the Wright farm as soon as the sky had lightened enough for safe travel. Though the sun had not yet risen, Uncle Jacob was already at work in the barn, but he did not break away from his chores to wish his brother-in-law a safe journey. Lorena had packed the horse's rucksacks with so much food that they strained at the seams, and Robert thanked his wife for providing enough to eat for a month of sightseeing. Mother and daughter smiled at his joke, for they knew he intended to make the journey as swiftly as possible. They kissed him and made him promise to take care, then followed him down to the Creek's Crossing road, where they stood and watched until horse and rider disappeared into the cool, graying mists that clung to the hills south of the farm.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When they could no longer see him, Lorena glared at the barn and said, "See how little he cares for us. He might never see my husband again, and yet he cannot even stir from the barn to bid him farewell."</p><p></p><p></p><p>Dorothea's heart quaked at her mother's ominous words, but said, "Likely Uncle Jacob knows how little we care for him and feels no need to make any pretense of fondness. Likely, too, he knows Father will certainly return."</p><p></p><p></p><p>Immediately Lorena was all reassurance. "Of course, my dear. Of course your father will return. Perhaps earlier than we expect him. Mr. Wright will not want to linger in the hostile South." She frowned at the barn. "If I would not miss him so, I would ask your father to take his time just to spite your uncle."</p><p></p><p></p><p>Dorothea smiled, knowing her mother would never wish for anything that would part her from her husband. Dorothea knew, too, that her mother often spoke wistfully of small acts of disobedience none of them dared commit. They were beholden to Uncle Jacob and must not commit any transgression that might tempt him to send them away. Uncle Jacob had no wife and no children, and therefore, no heir save his nephew, Dorothea's younger brother. If they served Uncle Jacob well and bided their time, one day Uncle Jacob's 120 acres, house, and worldly goods would belong to Jonathan.</p><p></p><p></p><p>For five years her parents had clung to these hopes with almost as much fervor as they pursued the abolition of slavery. They rarely seemed troubled by the doubts that plagued Dorothea. Uncle Jacob might marry again. He was older than her mother but even older men had taken young brides, although Dorothea could name no young woman of Creek's Crossing whose prospects were so poor she should settle on a stern, gray-haired, humorless man who had ample property but eschewed anything that hinted of romance. If he had once had a heart, he had buried it in the maple grove with his young bride and twin sons long before Dorothea was born.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Sometimes Dorothea suspected her parents were not entirely certain Jonathan would succeed in inheriting his uncle's farm. From an early age they had fostered his interest in medicine, and for the past two years he had served as an apprentice to an old family friend, a physician in far-off Baltimore. Jonathan had learned enough about farming to earn Uncle Jacob's grudging acceptance during his infrequent visits home, but he made no overt attempts to win his potential benefactor's affection. Dorothea wondered if his assured success in the vocation of his choosing had made him indifferent to the inheritance the rest of his family relied upon.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Either way, Jonathan surely would have been permitted to accompany their father and Mr. Wright south to Virginia. Though he was three years younger than Dorothea, he was a boy. Dorothea felt herself restricted and confined every minute she spent beneath Uncle Jacob's roof, even when he himself was not in the house. Her only moments of ease came as she walked to and from the schoolhouse on Third Street where she taught twenty youngsters reading, arithmetic, natural sciences, and history. When she felt the wind against her face as she crossed Elm Creek on the ferry, she feared that this was as close as she would ever come to knowing the freedom Jonathan took for granted.</p><p></p><p></p><p>At noon, Uncle Jacob and the hired hands came inside to...</p></p><h2>The Philippine War, 1899-1902 (Modern War Studies)</h2><p>This year begins the centennial of the Philippine War, one of the most controversial and poorly understood events in American history. The war thrust the U.S. into the center of Pacific and Asian politics, with important and sometimes tragic consequences. It kept the Filipinos under colonial overlordship for another five decades and subjected them to American political, cultural, and economic domination.<br><br>In the first comprehensive study in over six decades, Linn provides a definitive treatment of military operations in the Philippines. From the pitched battles of the early war to the final campaigns against guerrillas, Linn traces the entire course of the conflict. More than an overview of Filipino resistance and American pacification, this is a detailed study of the fighting in the "boondocks."<br><br>In addition to presenting a detailed military history of the war, Linn challenges previous interpretations. Rather than being a clash of armies or societies, the war was a series of regional struggles that differed greatly from island to island. By shifting away from the narrow focus on one or two provinces to encompass the entire archipelago, Linn offers a more thorough understanding of the entire war.<br><br>Linn also dispels many of the misunderstandings and historical inaccuracies surrounding the Philippine War.

Born from the ideas and research in her much-loved <i>Teaching Grammar in Context, </i>and benefiting from the creativity of her colleague Jonathan Bush, this new resource goes even further to bring the best research, theory, and practices into the classroom. <i>Grammar to Enrich and Enhance Writing </i>is three helpful books in one. In the first part, Weaver outlines the latest theories, research, and principles that underlie high-quality grammar instruction for writing. She demonstrates that specific, effective grammar-teaching practices: <ul> <li>address all of the 6 Traits of writing instruction </li><li>emphasize depth, not breadth </li><li>should be positive, productive, and practical-not stodgy, "correct," and limiting </li><li>must be incorporated throughout the writing process, not broken out in isolated units. </li></ul> In part two, Weaver links theory and practice. Her explicit, classroom-proven teaching ideas, strategies, and lessons address key subjects as diverse as helping students make better stylistic use of modifiers, incorporating grammar into revision, and mapping grammar instruction to the curriculum. Mostly in part three, she invites members of the field into a discussion of high-quality grammar instruction. Jeff Anderson (<i>Mechanically Inclined</i>)Rebecca Wheeler (<i>Code-Switching</i>), and other practicing teachers describe their teaching-how they model the vital role grammar plays in guiding students through the editing process, how they respond to student errors, how they help English Language Learners edit for conventional English, and how grammar supports code-switching among speakers of African American English. Like Weaver's, their ideas are ready for immediate classroom implementation. With all this, plus a brief primer on crucial grammatical concepts, <i>Grammar to Enrich and Enhance Writing</i> is what teachers have been waiting for: an up-to-date, ready-to-use, comprehensive resource for leading students to a better understanding of grammar as an aid to more purposeful, detailed, and sophisticated writing.

Reading Process &amp; Practice first appeared in 1988 and became widely known as the most authoritative, comprehensive, and definitive book of its kind. It helped teachers define reading in ways that support high-quality instruction. Connie once again led the way with the 1996 publication of the bestselling Teaching Grammar in Context and its companion Lessons to Share on Teaching Grammar in Context. Then she expanded and deepened her insights and specific teaching ideas in The Grammar Plan Book and Grammar to Enrich and Enhance Writing. In 1996, the Michigan Council of Teachers of English honored Weaver with the Charles C. Fries award for outstanding leadership in the profession. Connie was the Heckert Professor of Reading and Writing at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, and Professor Emerita of English at Western Michigan University.

How should gender politics be reconfigured in a world being transformed by automation, globalization and the digital revolution? <br><br> These questions are addressed in this bold new book by Helen Hester, a founding member of the 'Laboria Cuboniks' collective that developed the acclaimed manifesto 'Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation'. Hester develops a three-part definition of xenofeminism grounded in the ideas of technomaterialism, anti-naturalism, and gender abolitionism. She elaborates these ideas in relation to assistive reproductive technologies and interrogates the relationship between reproduction and futurity, while steering clear of a problematic anti-natalism.

Grammar Sense implements linguistic and applied linguistic research on how, where, when, and why native speakers use English structures, and how non-native speakers learn them. This series provides learners with a true understanding of how grammar is used in authentic contexts. Grammar is presented in discourse rather than in isolated sentences which allows the students to understand English grammar in real life situations.<br></p><p>Susan Kesner Bland has taught English as a Second Language and English as a Foreign Language in university and adult education programmes in the United States and abroad.

The passage of the Affordable Care Act was a major milestone, but rather than quell the rhetoric, it has sparked even more heated debate. In the latest edition of <i>Introduction to US Health Policy</i>, Donald A. Barr reviews the current structure of the American health care system, describing the historical and political contexts in which it developed and the core policy issues that continue to confront us today.</p><p>Barr&#x2019;s comprehensive analysis explores the various organizations and institutions that make the US health care system work&#x2015;or fail to work. He describes in detail the paradox of US health care&#x2015;simultaneously the best in the world and one of the worst among developed countries&#x2015;while introducing readers to broad cultural issues surrounding health care policy, such as access, affordability, and quality. Barr also discusses specific elements of US health care with depth and nuance, including insurance, especially Medicare and Medicaid. He scrutinizes the shift to for-profit managed care while analyzing the pharmaceutical industry, issues surrounding long-term care, the plight of the uninsured, the prevalence of medical errors, and the troublesome issue of nursing shortages. </p><p>The thoroughly updated edition of this widely adopted text focuses on the Affordable Care Act. It explains the steps taken to carry out the Act, the changes to the Act based on recent Supreme Court decisions, the success of the Act in achieving the combined goals of improved access to care and constraining the costs of care, and the continuing political controversy regarding its future. Drawing on an extensive range of resources, including government reports, scholarly publications, and analyses from a range of private organizations, <i>Introduction to US Health Policy</i> provides scholars, policymakers, and health care providers with a comprehensive platform of ideas that is key to understanding and influencing the changes in the US health care system.</p></p><p><p>The fourth edition of the essential guide to the contemporary US health care system.</p><p><b>Donald A.

Gurdjieff was one of the most original and provocative spiritual teachers in the twentieth-century West. Whereas much work on Gurdjieff has been either fawning or blindly critical, acclaimed scholar and writer Roger Lipsey balances sympathic interest in Gurdjieff and his "Fourth Way" teachings with a historian's sense of context and a biographer's feel for personality and relationships. Using a wide-range of published and unpublished sources, Lipsey explores Gurdjieff's formative travels in Central Asia, his famed teaching institution in France, the development of the Gurdjieff Movements and music, and, above all, Gurdjieff's fascinating continuous evolution as a teacher. <br><br>Published on the 70th anniversary of Gurdjieff's death, <i>Gurdjieff Reconsidered</i> delves deeply into Gurdjieff's writings and those of his most important students, including P. D. Ouspensky and Jeanne de Salzmann. Lipsey's comprehensive approach and unerring sense of the subject make this a must-read for anyone with a serious intention to explore Gurdjieff's life, teachings, and reputation.</p><p>ROGER LIPSEY is a biographer, art historian, translator, and, for many decades, a participant in the Gurdjieff teaching. He is the author of <i>Coomaraswamy: His Life and Work</i>; <i>An Art of Our Own: The Spiritual in Twentieth-Century Art</i>; <i>Angelic Mistakes: The Art of Thomas Merton</i>; <i>Make Peace Before the Sun Goes Down: The Long Encounter of Thomas Merton and His Abbott, James Fox</i>; and <i>Hammarskj�ld: A Life</i>, which has been hailed as the definitive biography of Dag Hammarskj�ld. Since the publication of the Hammarskj�ld biography, Roger speaks in many parts of the world under the auspices of the United Nations educational service."This work is exceptionally well written, limpid in style, terse in expression, and clear in sense. It is more than an excellent introduction to Gurdjieff for readers who know little of him or his work; it is, in effect, Gurdjieff considered as well as re-considered."&#x2014;Paul Beekman Taylor, author of <i>G.I. Gurdjieff: A New Life</i> and <i>Gurdjieff in the Public Eye<br><br></i>&#x201c;More than Gurdjieff reconsidered, this book is Gurdjieff rediscovered. Behind us are the rumors, shadows, circular repetitions of vague and undocumented criticism. We discover a man of infinite humanity. Gurdjieff was in advance of his time. His extremely innovative thinking, his all-embracing spiritual teaching, his music and Movements are pure gold and pure light for our troubled times.&#x201d;&#x2014;Basarab Nicolescu, author of&nbsp;<i>From Modernity to Cosmodernity<br><br></i>&#x201c;Lipsey&#x2019;s careful and insightful account of the various periods of Gurdjieff&#x2019;s teaching, beautifully framed by avoiding &#x2018;explanations&#x2019; of his ideas, enables him to bring home to the reader the living, passionate, and grounded man himself. Lipsey&#x2019;s humanity and wide perspective lead him to situate Gurdjieff in the company of many humane revolutionaries, ancient and modern. An exemplary contribution to the conversation.&#x201d;&#x2014;A. G. E. Blake, author of<i> The Intelligent Enneagram<br></i><br>&#x201c;Lipsey&#x2019;s <i>Gurdjieff Reconsidered</i> is a welcome addition to the field of Gurdjieff Studies and the field of Western esotericism, more generally. The book is an excellent introduction to Gurdjieff&#x2019;s ideas, thanks to the author&#x2019;s use of an abundance of primary sources.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Reading Religion<br></i><br><i><br></i></p><h2>The Practice of Aromatherapy: A Classic Compendium of Plant Medicines and Their Healing Properties</h2><p>This classic manual provides detailed evidence for the efficacy of plant medicine.

When Kel is picked instead by the legendary Lord Raoul, the unexpected honor shocks her enemies across the realm. Kel must quickly prove herself up to the task, mastering her fighting and leadership skills while discovering what it takes to be part of the royal guard. A new romance is blossoming as well, bringing with it the rush of first love and the unexpected challenges of balancing knight work and a relationship. All the while, Kel prepares for her biggest fear: the infamous &#x201c;Ordeal,&#x201d; the last challenge that stands between her and knighthood.<br><br> More timely than ever, the Protector of the Small series is Anti-Bullying 101 while also touching on issues of bravery, friendship, and dealing humanely with refugees against a backdrop of an action-packed fantasy adventure.<br><br> "Tamora Pierce's books shaped me not only as a young writer but also as a young woman. She is a pillar, an icon, and an inspiration. Cracking open one of her marvelous novels always feels like coming home."<br> &#x2014;<b>SARAH J. MAAS</b>, #1<i> New York Times</i> bestselling author<br><br> "Tamora Pierce didn't just blaze a trail. Her heroines cut a swath through the fantasy world with wit, strength, and savvy. Her stories still lead the vanguard today. Pierce is the real lioness, and we're all just running to keep pace."<br> &#x2014;<b>LEIGH BARDUGO</b>, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author</p><p>In Book 3 of Tamora Pierce's <i>Protector of the Small</i> sequence, 14-year-old Keladry of Mindelan is ready to begin training as a squire after undergoing four grueling years as the first girl to be officially educated as a page. Disappointed at first that Lady Alanna (whom we first met in the Song of the Lioness Quartet series) does not choose her, Kel is delighted when gruff, good-natured, down-to-earth Lord Raoul takes her on. The next four years prove to be tough but happy, for the most part, as Raoul and most of the others in the King's Own (a corps of 300 men--299 now, plus Kel--that enforces the law and helps local nobles deal with problems such as centaur attacks and forest robberies) treat Kel as an equal. Throughout, Kel is physically and mentally preparing herself for the final test in the Chamber of the Ordeal, in which fourth-year squires must successfully face their greatest fears before becoming knights.<p> In this sequel to <i>First Test: Protector of the Small</i> and <i>Page: Protector of the Small</i>, Kel continues to be an admirable role model: stoutly loyal, strong, independent, honest, yet very real in her fears and weaknesses. Romance lurks for the budding adolescent as she develops a crush on one fellow and begins a sweet kissing-only relationship with another, after a very frank discussion about sex with her mother. Although the buildup to the Ordeal is watered down a bit by Kel's periodic visits to the Chamber door for a taste of what's to come, overall, this latest in Pierce's series is a rousing tale of chivalry and heroism that any reader will be sorely challenged to put down. (Ages 12 and older) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>When Kel is chosen by the legendary Lord Raoul to be his squire, the conservatives of the realm hardly think she's up to the job. Kel earns respect and admiration among the men, as well as the affection of a fellow squire.<br>"This feminist fantasy is a delightful read."--KLIATT</p><h2>One Candle: A Historical Novel</h2><p>It is 1849 barely two years after the Saints arrival in Utah and missionaries are being sent out to preach the gospel to the world. One of them, Lorenzo Snow, is sent to Italy. He is led to the valleys of the Piedmont, where the Waldenese, followers of the reformer Peter Waldo, have been exiled and persecuted. There, Elder Snow and his two companions find both success and challenges. Hiking into the alpine mountains near the town of Torre Pellice, they are recognized by Madeleine Cardon, who had seen a vision of them bringing the gospel years earlier. Her family and others soon welcome the missionaries into their lives.<p>Madeleine's best friend, Albertina Guy, faces her own challenges as her heart is drawn to this new faith. Her family is Catholic; her great-uncle is a priest in the local monastery. Joining the Mormons could mean being expelled from her family. When Elder Snow heals her dying young brother with a priesthood blessing, Albertina and her family must reassess their feelings for these Mormon missionaries and the doctrine they preach.</p><p> Based on the true story of the first LDS missionaries in Italy, <i>One Candle</i> shows the gospel of Jesus Christ changing lives and rolling forward boldly, nobly, and independent in the early days of the Restoration.</p></p><p>Gale Sears is an award-winning author known for her historical accuracy and intensive research.

Whether you were the king's court astrologer or a farmer marking the best time for planting, timekeeping and numbers really mattered. Mistake a numerical pattern of petals and you could be poisoned. Lose the rhythm of a sacred dance or the meter of a ritually told story and the intricately woven threads that hold life together were spoiled. Ignore the celestial clock of equinoxes and solstices, and you'd risk being caught short of food for the winter.<br><br>Shesso's friendly tone and clear grasp of the information make the math "go down easy" in this marvelous book.</p><p>Renna Shesso brings a life-long study of mystical traditions to her writing. Inspired by her herbalist/astrologer grandmother, she studies mythology and history, archeology, tarot, the vast lore of the Goddess traditions, and many other good mysteries. A long-time resident of Colorado, she is a shamanic practitioner and a teacher and priestess of Wicca."As thoughtful as it is readable, Renna Shesso's <i>Math for Mystics</i> is the book I wish I had when I first started trying to make sense of the mathematics that underlie so much of modern magic and traditional occult lore. Not the least of its virtues is the way it makes magical number theory accessible even to those who think they don't like or can't handle math. It provides a first-rate introduction to a fairly neglected branch of magical lore." -- <b>John Michael Greer</b>, Grand Archdruid, Ancient Order of Druids in America and author of <i>The Druidry Handbook</i><br><br>"In times past, math was seen as magic for its power and associations. It was even banned by authorities who thought it a threat--a power that no one else should hold. In this book, that ancient magic is relived, and the power yours." -- <b>Jeff Hoke</b>, author of <i>The Museum of Lost Wonder</i></p><h2>Cronopios and Famas</h2><p><p><strong><em>Cronopios and Famas</em> is one of the best-loved books by Julio Cort�zar, one of the greatest of Latin American novelists.</strong></p> "The Instruction Manual," the first chapter, is an absurd assortment of tasks and items dissected in an instruction-manual format. "Unusual Occupations," the second chapter, describes the obsessions and predilections of the narrator's family, including the lodging of a tiger-just one tiger- "for the sole purpose of seeing the mechanism at work in all its complexity." Finally, the "Cronopios and Famas" section delightfully characterizes, in the words of Carlos Fuentes, "those enemies of pomposity, academic rigor mortis and cardboard celebrity-a band of literary Marx Brothers." As the <em>Saturday Review</em> remarked: "Each page of <em>Cronopios and Famas</em> sparkles with vivid satire that goes to the heart of human character and, in the best pieces, to the essence of the human condition."</p><p><p><strong>Julio Cort�zar</strong> (1914-1984), Argentine novelist, poet, essayist, and short-story writer, was born in Brussels, and moved permanently to France in 1951. Cortazar is now recognized as one of the century's major experimental writers, reflecting the influence of French surrealism, psychoanalysis, and his love of both photography and jazz, along with his strong commitment to revolutionary Latin American politics.</p><p><strong>Paul Blackburn</strong>&nbsp;(November 24, 1926&#x2013;September 13, 1971) was an American poet. He influenced contemporary literature through his&nbsp;poetry, translations and the encouragement and support he offered to fellow poets.</p>Anyone who doesn't read Cortazar is doomed. Not to read him is a serious invisible disease which in time can have terrible consequences. Something similar to a man who has never tasted peaches. He would quietly become sadder . . . and, probably, little by little, he would lose his hair. -- <i>Pablo Neruda</i></p><h2>Oscar Wilde</h2><p>Winner of both the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Pulitzer Prize, <i>Oscar Wilde </i>is the definitive biography of the tortured poet and playwright and the last book by renowned biographer and literary critic Richard Ellmann. Ellmann dedicated two decades to the research and writing of this biography, resulting in a complex and richly detailed portrait of Oscar Wilde. Ellman captures the wit, creativity, and charm of the psychologically and sexually complicated writer, as well as the darker aspects of his personality and life. Covering everything from Wilde's rise as a young literary talent to his eventual imprisonment and death in exile with exquisite detail, Ellmann's fascinating account of Wilde's life and work is a resounding triumph.</p><p>Richard Ellmann capped an illustrious career in biography (his <i>James Joyce</i> is considered one of the masterpieces of the 20th century) with this life of Oscar Wilde, which won both the National Book Critics Circle Award and Pulitzer Prize on its original publication in 1988. Ellmann's account of Wilde's extravagantly operatic life as poet, playwright, aesthete, and martyr to sexual morality is notable not only for the full portrait it gives of Wilde, but also for Ellmann's assessment of his subject's literary greatness; both aims are served by a plethora of quotations from Wilde's own work and correspondence. Wilde straddled the line between the Victorian age and the modern world as he did everything in life ... with impeccable style.The biography sensitive to the tragic pattern of the story of a great subject: Oscar Wilde - psychologically and sexually complicated, enormously quotable, central to a alluring cultural world and someone whose life assumed an unbearably dramatic shape.</p><h2>The Orchard (American Poets Continuum)</h2><p>Richly allusive, the poems in Brigit Pegeen Kelly&#x2019;s <i>The Orchard </i>evoke elements of myth in distinctive aural and rhythmic patterns.

The roasted nuts taste like bitter chocolate, coffee, and burnt popcorn.&nbsp;The roots of Skunk Cabbage provided another traditional food source, while also serving as a medicine for colds. In tribal mythology, the leaves of Skunk Cabbage were thought to be tents where the Little People sheltered.<br> &nbsp;<br> Very little has been published until now on the ethnobotany of western Oregon indigenous peoples.&nbsp; <i>Ethnobotany of the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians </i>documents the use of plants by these closely-related coastal tribes, covering a geographical area that extends roughly from Cape Perpetua on the central coast, south to the Coquille River, and from the Coast Range west to the Pacific shore. With a focus on native plants and their traditional uses, it also includes mention of farming crops, as well as the highly invasive Himalayan blackberry, which some Oregon coast Indians called the "white man's berry."<br> &nbsp;<br> The cultures of the Coos Bay, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw are distinct from the Athabaskan speaking people to the south, and the Alsea to the north.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, many tribal members are reviving ancient arts of basket weaving and woodworking, and many now participate in annual intertribal canoe events. <i>Ethnobotany of the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians</i> contributes to this cultural renaissance by filling an important gap in the historical record.

With the beginning market for small- to medium-sized one-family dwellings came a succession of innovative home designs that transformed American domestic architecture.<br>This outstanding book presents 500 small-home designs of the 1920s as they appeared in a major architectural publication of 1923. Many are by leading domestic architects of the period. Each design is presented in a handsome perspective drawing or photograph, along with floor plans and a description of its principal features.<br>The designs reflect many variations on the basic themes of American colonial architecture, updated by new construction technology and the design aesthetics of the post&#x2012;World War I era. The Bungalow and semi-bungalow were perhaps the biggest design news of the times, and they are generously represented in this huge collection. Because of the practicality and good looks of the best of these designs, and perhaps for the nostalgia they evoke, many are being revived today by builders and buyers in communities across America.<br>Architects, architectural, and social historians, students and enthusiasts of architecture and design will find in these pages a rich selection of small-home concepts that once set the standard for a new era in American home design, and that still form an integral part of our landscape many decades after their first inspiration.</p><p></p><h2>Just Love: A Framework for Christian Sexual Ethics</h2><p><p>Winner of the 2008 Grawemeyer Award in Religion</p><p>This long-awaited book by one of American Christianity's foremost ethicists proposes a framework for sexual ethics whereby justice is the criterion for all loving, including love that is related to sexual activity and relationships. It begins with historical and cross-cultural explorations, then addresses the large questions of embodiment, gender, and sexuality, and finally delineates the justice framework for sexual ethics.</p><p>Though <i>Just Love</i>'s particular focus is Christian sexual ethics, Farley's framework is broad enough to have relevance for multiple traditions. Also covered are specific issues in sexual ethics, including same-sex relationships, marriage and family, divorce and second marriage.</p></p><p>Margaret A. Farley holds the Gilbert L. Stark Chair in Christian Ethics and Professor Emerita at Yale University Divinity School. She was awarded the 2007 St Elizabeth Setan Medal and 2008 Grawemeyer award. She is also a past president of the Society of Christian Ethics and the Catholic Theological Society of America.'In a world of moral confusion and ethical compromise, the principles for which Margaret Farley stands have shone as a lodestar of hope. Or perhaps like a beacon, for her life and work guide us though the haze of uncertainty in which we nowadays perforce live, leading us always toward the good and the real.' - Sherwin Nuland, author of How We Live and How We Die.<br><br> <p></p><br><br>Reference &amp; Research Book News/ August 2006 (mention)<br><br>'On a topic about which too many angry polemics are written, Farley's calm, commonsense style comes as a relief...This will be a wonderful book to use with students...In a society where sex is used to sell nearly everything...Margaret Farley has the guts and the clarity of mind to give as a third alternative to "narrowly constituted moral systems and rules" on the one hand and sexual chaos on the other.'William C. Placher, <em>Christian Century</em>, October 17th 2006 (<i>The Christian Century</i>)<br><br><em>Just Love</em> carries to a new level Farley's analysis of different world-views and cultural systems....As a theologian, Farley gives us a social ethic of sex that incorporates both the biblical "option for the poor" and the orientation of Catholic social thought to the universal common good. As a feminist, she reminds Catholics that their tradition should make its global option for women more consistent, more explicit and more effective, especially in the areas of sex, motherhood, marriage and family.' ~ Lisa Sowell Cahill, <em>America</em>, December 2006 (Lisa Sowle Cahill, J. Donald Monan Professor of Theology, Boston College)<br><br> <p></p><br><br>'This is an excellent work by a leading Roman Catholic feminist and ethicist, written with flair, clarity, and absence of jargon. The many changing circumstances surrounding sexuality are well described. The influence of Foucault and Freud is critically introduced. The Christian traditions of thinking abut sex, and their indebtedness to Graeco-Roman assumptions, are helpfully summarised.' (Adrian Thatcher, Church Times, February 2007 <i>Church Times</i>)<br><br>"Farley is best known for her largeness of spirit and for the demanding intelligence she brings to her teaching and writing. Her new book exudes those qualities...Farley's manner is academic but not obscure, and once readers grow comfortable with it, they will reap the benefits of wisdom gleaned from decades of teaching and scholarship...I consider <em>Just Love </em>an important resource and spur for further collaboration among Christians and others on the knotty issues of sexual ethics. Throughout her book, Farley evinces the sort of intellectual modesty that comes from great learning and an open mind....<em>Just Love</em> does not provide all the answers concerning sexual ethics. But it does lay out a serious and solid framework for thinking about them." (Luke Timothy Johnson, Commonweal <i>Commonweal</i>)<br><br>"The double entendre of the title, <i>is only the start of an excellent book. Margaret Farley examines the meaning of human sexuality and how this meaning can be incorporated into what she terms "a moral view of human and Christian life." Eschewing simple answers to what can be murky questions, and withholding judgment based in either a strictly deontological approach or a relativized culturally conditioned ethic on sexual issues, Farley sets out to establish adequate criteria to judge the goodness or rightness of the human sexual interaction. While she neither denies or dismisses the insights of western culture, including the teaching and tradition of the Catholic Church, she embraces the healthy anthropology of that tradition that assumes human beings can continue to learn more about themselves and their sexuality. Insights can be found in many areas, including the conclusions of alternative sexual ethical frameworks proposed by contemporary thinkers. New knowledge may press beyond past conclusions, resulting in the development of new normative positions. The author does not promise answers, but rather proposes a framework from which answers can be derived. The marvel of the book is that she has managed in just 300 pages to cover so much ground and do it so well. "...Farley's work, the patina of her practical wisdom and passionate caring gives heart to what is a highly scholarly work. The author's colleagues, students and other readers&#x2014;dare I say "devotees"&#x2014;will not be disappointed in <i>Just Love.</i> Farley has, in her usual fashion, covered the topic with impeccable scholarship, practical wisdom and a compassion and acceptance for the existential reality of human beings in a sexual world. The book, while clearly not an ideal beach book, will keep the reader interested to the end."</i><i> (<i>Catholic Books Review</i>)<br><br> Farley's book can be recommended for scholar and novice alike. The work is eminently readable, despite the profundity of its subject matter. It is extensively documented, with clarifying and often lengthy footnotes, which the average person may simply ignore...nearly 300 works are cited in the explanatory notes."

They have been a vital presence in North America since the 16th century. <em>Muslims in America</em> unearths their history, documenting the lives of African, Middle Eastern, South Asian, European, black, white, Hispanic and other Americans who have been followers of Islam. <br> The book begins with the tale of Job Ben Solomon, a 18th century African American Muslim slave, and goes on to chart the stories of sodbusters in North Dakota, African American converts to Islam in the 1920s, Muslim barkeepers in Toledo, the post-1965 wave of professional immigrants from Asia and Africa, and Muslim Americans after 9/11. The book reveals the richness of Sunni, Shi'a, Sufi and other forms of Islamic theology, ethics, and rituals in the United States by illustrating the way Islamic faith has been imagined and practiced in the everyday lives of individuals. <em>Muslims in</em> <em>America</em> recovers the place of Muslims in the larger American story, too. Showing how Muslim American men and women participated in each era of U.S. history, the book explores how they have both shaped and have been shaped by larger historical trends such as the abolition movement, Gilded Age immigration, the Great Migration of African Americans, urbanization, religious revivalism, the feminist movement, and the current war on terror. It also shows how, from the very beginning of American history, Muslim Americans have been at once a part of their local communities, their nation, and the worldwide community of Muslims.<br> The first single-author history of Muslims in America from colonial times to the present, this book fills a huge gap and provides invaluable background on one of the most poorly understood groups in the United States.<br><br>Religion in American Life explores the evolution, character, and dynamic of organized religion in America from 1500 to the present day.

Curtis IV is Millennium Chair of the Liberal Arts and Professor of Religious Studies at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). Winner of Carnegie, Fulbright, Mellon, and NEH fellowships, he has&nbsp;authored or edited six books on African American and Muslim American history.Starred Review. Curtis, a religious studies professor and authority on Islam in America, has authored a fine and succinct history that spans centuries. He hits all the major chronological points and historical details of Muslims living in North America, including notable tales of African slaves who maintained their religion despite great hardship. Curtis has literally combed through every record imaginable, including, for example, a 1939 Works Progress Administration&#x2013;funded interview of Mrs. Mary Juma, a Syrian homesteader in North Dakota, in assembling this very readable history. Unmatched for its breadth of sources, this is also one of the few books in the field to cover both immigrant and indigenous (African-American) American Muslims. One of the strongest sections chronicles American Muslim condemnation of terrorism after 9/11, a condemnation largely unnoticed by the greater American community. Although geared toward non-Muslims, American Muslims would also learn a great deal from reading about their own history. Photographs, chronology, edited selections from chosen narratives, and a Further Reading Section provide useful jumping-off points for the reader, who will undoubtedly be intrigued by Curtis's compelling little read. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Equal weight is given to assembling field observations from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock types. There are also substantial chapters on producing a field notebook, collecting structural information, recording fossil data and constructing geological maps. The volume is in a robust and handy size, with colour coded chapters for ease of use and quick reference in the field. <p><i>Geological Field Techniques</i> is designed for students, amateur enthusiasts and professionals who have a background in geology and wish to collect field data on rocks and geological features. Teaching aspects of this textbook include:</p> <ul> <li>step-by-step guides to essential practical skills such as using a compass-clinometer, making a geological map and drawing a field sketch;</li> <li>tricks of the trade, checklists, flow charts and short worked examples;</li> <li>over 200 illustrations of a wide range of field notes, maps and geological features;</li> <li>appendices with the commonly used rock description and classification diagrams;</li> <li>a supporting website hosted by Wiley Blackwell.</li> </ul></p><p><b>Dr Angela L.

The rune-constructs he was studying were starting to blur together. He&#x2019;d almost made a mistake&#x2014;and that was inexcusable. <br> &nbsp;<br> But he had caught himself in time, corrected it. Closing his aching eyes, he went over the construct again in his mind.<br> &nbsp;<br> Begin with the heart-rune. Connect this sigil&#x2019;s stem to an adjoining rune&#x2019;s base. Inscribe the sigla on the breast, working upward to the head. Yes, that was where he&#x2019;d gone wrong the first few times. The head was important&#x2014;vital. Then draw the sigla on the trunk, finally the arms, the legs.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was perfect. He could find no flaw. In his mind&#x2019;s eye, he imagined the dead body on which he&#x2019;d been working rising up and living again. A corrupt form of life, admittedly, but a beneficial one. The corpse was far more useful now than it would have been moldering in the ground.<br> &nbsp;<br> Xar smiled in triumph, but it was a triumph whose life span was shorter than that of his imaginary defunct. His thoughts went something like this:<br> &nbsp;<br> I can raise the dead.<br> &nbsp;<br> At least I am fairly certain I can raise the dead.<br> &nbsp;<br> I can&#x2019;t be sure.<br> &nbsp;<br> That was the pall over his elation. There were no dead for him to raise. Or rather, there were too many dead. Just not dead enough.<br> &nbsp;<br> In bitter frustration, Xar slammed his hands down on the elaborately conceived rune-construct. The rune-bones1 went flying, skittering and sliding off the table onto the floor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Xar paid no attention to them. He could always put the construct together again. Again and again. He knew it as well as he knew the rune-magic to conjure up water. For all the good it would do him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Xar needed a corpse. One not more than three days dead. One that hadn&#x2019;t been seized by these wretched lazars.2 Irritably he swept the last few remaining rune-bones to the floor.<br> &nbsp;<br> He left the room he used as his study, headed for his private chambers. On his way, he passed by the library. And there was Kleitus, the Dynast, former ruler (until his death) of Necropolis, the largest city on Abarrach. At his death, Kleitus had become a lazar&#x2014;one of the living dead. Now the Dynast&#x2019;s gruesome form, which was neither dead nor alive, wandered the halls and corridors of the palace that had once been his. The lazar thought it was still his. Xar knew better, but he saw no reason to disabuse Kleitus of the notion.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Lord of the Nexus steeled himself to speak to the Lord of the Living Dead. Xar had fought many terrible foes during his struggles to free his people from the Labyrinth. Dragons, wolfen, snogs, chaodyn&#x2014;every monster the Labyrinth could create. Xar feared nothing. Nothing living. The lord couldn&#x2019;t help feeling a qualm deep in his bowels when he looked into the hideous, ever-shifting death-mask face of the lazar. Xar saw the hatred in the eyes&#x2014;the hatred that the dead bore the living of Abarrach.<br> &nbsp;<br> An encounter with Kleitus was never pleasant. Xar generally avoided the lazar. The lord found it uncomfortable talking to a being who had one thought on his mind: death. Your death.<br> &nbsp;<br> The sigla on Xar&#x2019;s body glowed blue, defending him from attack. The blue light was reflected in the Dynast&#x2019;s dead eyes, which glittered with disappointment. The lazar had tried once, on Xar&#x2019;s arrival, to kill the Patryn. The battle between the two had been brief, spectacular. Kleitus had never tried it again. But the lazar dreamed of it during the endless hours of his tormented existence. He never failed to mention it when they came together.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Someday, Xar,&#x201d; said Kleitus, the corpse talking, &#x201c;I will catch you unawares. And then you will join us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;...&nbsp;join us,&#x201d; came the unhappy echo of the lazar&#x2019;s soul. The two parts of the dead always spoke together, the soul being just a bit slower than the body.<br> &nbsp;<br> It must be nice for you to have a goal still,&#x201d; Xar said somewhat testily. He couldn&#x2019;t help it. The lazar made him nervous. But the lord needed help, information, and Kleitus was the only one&#x2014;so far as Xar could determine&#x2014;who might have it. &#x201c;I have a goal myself. One I would like to discuss with you. If you have the time?&#x201d; Nervousness made Xar sarcastic.<br> &nbsp;<br> Try as he might, Xar could not look for long at the lazar&#x2019;s face. It was the face of a corpse&#x2014;a murdered corpse, for Kleitus had himself been slain by another lazar, had then been brought back to hideous life. The face would sometimes be the face of one long dead, and then suddenly it would be the face of Kleitus as he had been when he was alive. The transformation occurred when the soul moved into the body, struggled to renew life, regain what it had once possessed. Thwarted, the soul flew out of the body, tried vainly to free itself from its prison. The soul&#x2019;s continual rage and frustration gave an unnatural warmth to the chill, dead flesh.<br> &nbsp;<br> Xar looked at Kleitus, looked away hastily.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Will you accompany me to the library?&#x201d; Xar asked with a polite gesture, his gaze anywhere but on the corpse.<br> &nbsp;<br> The lazar followed willingly. Kleitus had no particular desire to be of assistance to the Lord of the Nexus, as Xar well knew. The lazar came because there was always the possibility that Xar might weaken, inadvertently lower his defenses. Kleitus came because he hoped to murder Xar.<br> &nbsp;<br> Alone in the room with the lazar, Xar considered briefly summoning another Patryn to stand guard. He immediately abandoned the idea, was aghast at himself for even thinking such a thing. Not only would such a summons make him appear weak in the eyes of his people&#x2014;who worshipped him&#x2014;but he wanted no one else to know the subject of his discussions.<br> &nbsp;<br> Consequently, though he did so with misgivings, Xar shut the door made of braided kairn grass, marked it with Patryn runes of warding so that it could not be opened. He drew these runes over faded Sartan runes, Sartan magic that had long ago ceased to function.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kleitus&#x2019;s lifeless eyes sprang suddenly to life, focused on Xar&#x2019;s throat. The dead fingers twitched in anticipation.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, no, my friend,&#x201d; Xar said pleasantly. &#x201c;Another day, perhaps. Or would you like to come again within the circle of my power? Would you like to feel again my magic starting to unravel your existence?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Kleitus stared at him with unblinking hatred. &#x201c;What do you want, Lord of the Nexus?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;...&nbsp;Nexus,&#x201d; came the sad echo.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I want to sit down,&#x201d; Xar said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had a wearing time of it. Two days and nights on the rune-construct. But I have solved it. I now know the secret to the art of necromancy. I can now raise the dead.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Congratulations,&#x201d; said Kleitus, and the dead lips curled in a sneer. &#x201c;You can now destroy your people as we destroyed ours.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Xar let that pass. The lazar tended to have a dark outlook on things. He supposed he couldn&#x2019;t blame them.<br> &nbsp;<br> The lord took his seat at a large stone table whose top was covered with dusty volumes: a treasure-trove of Sartan lore. Xar had spent as much time studying these works as possible, considering the myriad duties of a lord about to lead his people to war. But this time spent among the Sartan books was minute compared to the years Kleitus had spent. And Xar was at a disadvantage: he was forced to read the material in a foreign language&#x2014;the Sartan language. Although he had mastered that language while in the Nexus, the task of breaking down the Sartan rune-structure, then rebuilding it into Patryn thought, was exhausting and time-consuming.<br> &nbsp;<br> Xar could never, under any circumstances, think like a Sartan.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kleitus had the information Xar needed. Kleitus had delved deep into these books. Kleitus was&#x2014;or had been&#x2014;a Sartan himself. He knew. He understood. But how to worm it out of the corpse? That was the tricky part.<br> &nbsp;<br> Xar wasn&#x2019;t fooled by the lazar&#x2019;s shambling walk and bloodthirsty demeanor. Kleitus was playing a far more subtle game. An army of living, warm-blooded beings had recently arrived on Abarrach&#x2014;Patryns, brought here by Xar, brought here to train for war. The lazar hungered after these living beings, longed to destroy the life that the dead coveted and at the same time found so abhorrent. The lazar could not fight the Patryns. The Patryns were too powerful.<br> &nbsp;<br> But it required an immense outlay of the Patryns&#x2019; magic to sustain life in the darksome caverns of Abarrach. The Patryns were beginning to weaken&#x2014;ever so slightly. So had the Sartan weakened before them; so had many of the Sartan died.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Divided Allegiance (The Deed of Paksenarrion, Book 2)</h2><p>The veteran warrior Paksenarrion faces a series of difficult challenges and combats and is finally accepted for training at an academy for aspiring knights</p><p>Once a sheepfarmer's daughter, now a seasoned veteran.

Her heart ached as she drew a slow, shaky breath.<br><br>Much as she didn&#x2019;t want to be here, it was time. Despite the emotions warring within her, Hannah knew she had no choice. She needed to come now, just as she&#x2019;d needed to come two years ago when Matt Bronzan asked her to be his wife.<br><br>By then she had grieved the loss of her first husband, and with a strength that was not her own, she&#x2019;d survived. Enough to tell Matt yes, to believe there was indeed a new life for her and young Jenny on the other side of a darkness and pain that had nearly destroyed them both.<br><br>Coming here had been difficult back then too, but it had given her a chance to say good-bye to Tom, to thank him for all they&#x2019;d shared, and to release him. To let die a flame she thought would burn forever. Hannah set her gaze in the direction of their tombstones and pulled her sweater tighter.<br><br>Her eyes welled up. Now it was time to let go of Alicia.<br><br>This was a private moment&#x2014;one she needed to share with Tom and Alicia alone. Regardless of shaded grounds, the glasses would stay. She walked amidst the markers, her fingers brushing against an occasional cold stone as she made her way across the cemetery to the place where their markers lay, side by side.<br><br>Her eyes drifted from one to the other. <i>Dr. Thomas J. Ryan...Alicia Marie Ryan</i>. The birth dates were different, but the date of death was the same: <i>August 28, 1998.<br><br></i>A lump formed in Hannah&#x2019;s throat, and she swallowed hard as she knelt down, sitting back on her heels. She wiped an errant tear from her cheek... Alicia would have been nineteen, finished with high school and making her way through college. In love, perhaps, or dreaming of a career.<br><br><i>Alicia. I miss you, baby...<br></i><br>It was harder to picture them now, harder to see the crisp definition in her mind&#x2019;s scrapbook...how Tom&#x2019;s eyes sparkled when she was in his arms, or the way Alicia&#x2019;s smile lit up a room...<br><br>They&#x2019;d lost so much in one terrible moment. A drunk driver, an awful collision...and the life she and Tom had spent years building was shattered.<br><br>Hannah exhaled, and the sound mingled with the breeze. <i>You can do this</i>. She squeezed her eyes shut, searching for the strength to move ahead. She and Matt had worked out the plans for more than a year. It was the right thing, she was sure of that much. Even now, with sadness covering her heart like a blanket, she could feel the excitement welling within her, convincing her that somehow, sometime soon, it would happen.<br><br>She would be a mother again.<br><br>&#x201c;Hi...&#x201d; She set her fingertips on Alicia&#x2019;s tombstone and dusted off a layer of dirt. &#x201c;I have something to tell you.&#x201d;<br><br>A crow sounded in the distance. This visit was for peace of mind and nothing more. Hannah&#x2019;s precious oldest daughter would never have questioned her intentions, never have doubted her place in Hannah&#x2019;s heart. Her fingers stopped moving and settled over Alicia&#x2019;s name.<br><br>&#x201c;Matt and I have decided to...to adopt a little girl.&#x201d; Her voice broke, and from behind her sunglasses tears trickled down her face and dripped off her chin.<br><br>She waited until she could find her voice. &#x201c;After...after the accident I couldn&#x2019;t imagine ever loving another man,&#x201d; Hannah wiped the back of her hand across her wet chin. &#x201c;Or another daughter.&#x201d; A sound that was part laugh, part sob slipped from her lips. &#x201c;But here I am, happy, married, and...convinced God has another daughter for me somewhere out there.&#x201d;<br><br>The traffic hummed from the road behind her. &#x201c;You understand, right, Alicia? I&#x2019;m not trying to...to replace you, honey.&#x201d; She sniffed. &#x201c;The bond you and I shared, the one you and Jenny shared, that&#x2019;s something none of us will ever have again. Not like it was.&#x201d;<br><br>Hannah paused and gazed up, willing herself to see beyond the blue to the place where Tom and Alicia now lived and loved and laughed.<br><br>Gradually her eyes shifted back to the tombstones. &#x201c;I saw a documentary last night about kids in America, kids waiting for someone to love them, and...I don&#x2019;t know... something inside me snapped.&#x201d; She shrugged and managed a smile despite the fresh tears on her cheeks. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t have more babies. We&#x2019;ve known that since Jenny was born. But adoption?&#x201d; She sniffed. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t sure I could do it...until last night. Then, all of a sudden, I knew. I could open my heart to another little girl.&#x201d;<br><br>The background noise faded. Hannah traced the A in Alicia&#x2019;s name, pushing away the dirt that had gathered there. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll adopt a toddler, someone who needs a second chance at life.&#x201d; She blinked, and two more tears slid off the tip of her nose onto Alicia&#x2019;s stone. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know where she is...or who she is. But I know she&#x2019;s out there somewhere. And I wanted you to know bec&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>There was a catch in Hannah&#x2019;s voice, and she held the sobs at bay. &#x201c;Because she&#x2019;ll be your sister.&#x201d;<br><br>Hannah closed her eyes again and waited. The image of her oldest daughter grew clear in her mind once more. &#x201c;Alicia...&#x201d;<br><br>There she was. The smile, the honey blonde hair, the warmth in her eyes...it was all as close and real as if she were standing there in person.<br><br>There were no words, but a distinct sense of approval pierced the darkness. The feeling swelled, and Hannah had no doubts. God wanted her to know Alicia would have supported this decision with her whole being.<br><br>Hannah ached to reach out and pull the image of her daughter close, but the lines began to blur. As they did, peace oozed between the cracks in Hannah&#x2019;s heart. It was okay to let her daughter&#x2019;s memory fade for now. The visit had reminded her once more that she no longer needed to feel the pain of Alicia&#x2019;s and Tom&#x2019;s deaths with every excruciating breath, but only as a sad truth that simply was and could not be changed.<br><br>Hope wrapped its arms around her as she opened her eyes. It was time to go home, time to let Matt and Jenny know what she&#x2019;d decided. Of course, Jade and Tanner Eastman would want to know, too. The couple had become their best friends these past years. They&#x2019;d been there while Matt and Hannah walked through a year of collecting documents and filling out adoption forms, gathering letters and completing a dossier.<br><br>The Eastmans understood. They were desperate to have a baby, but so far hadn&#x2019;t been able.<br><br>Despite Hannah&#x2019;s tears, a smile tugged at her lips. Yes, Jade and Tanner would be thrilled that Hannah was finally ready to move forward.<br><br>She let her eyes settle on Tom&#x2019;s tombstone. &#x201c;Pray for us, Tom.&#x201d; Two tears landed near his name, and she wiped her cheeks with her fingertips. &#x201c;Pray for the little girl...whoever she is.&#x201d;<br><br>Once more she looked back at the stone, at Alicia&#x2019;s name carved in it. &#x201c;One more thing, honey.

In&nbsp;<i>Architects of the Culture of Death</i>, authors Donald DeMarco and Benjamin Wiker expose the Culture of Death as an intentional and malevolent ideology promoted by influential thinkers who specifically attack Christian morality's core belief in the sanctity of human life and the existence of man's immortal soul. In scholarly, yet reader-friendly prose, DeMarco and Wiker examine the roots of the Culture of Death by introducing 23 of its architects, including Ayn Rand, Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Jean-Paul Sartre, Alfred Kinsey, Margaret Sanger, Jack Kevorkian, and Peter Singer. <p>Still, this is not a book without hope. If the Culture of Death rests on a fragmented view of the person and an eclipse of God, the future of the Culture of Life relies on an understanding and restoration of the human being as a person, and the rediscovery of a benevolent God. The personalism of John Paul II is an illuminating thread that runs through&nbsp;<i>Architects</i>, serving as a hopeful antidote.</p></p><p><b>Donald De Marco</b>, an Associate Professor of Philosophy at St. Jerome's College, Ontario, has written hundreds of magazine articles, and is the author of eleven books.&nbsp;<b>Benjamin Wiker</b>&nbsp;is the author of&nbsp;<i>Moral Darwinism.</i></p><h2>Alexander Hamilton: The Making of America #1</h2><p>The America that Alexander Hamilton knew was largely agricultural and built on slave labor. He envisioned something else: a multi-racial, urbanized, capitalistic America with a strong central government. He believed that such an America would be a land of opportunity for the poor and the newcomers. But Hamilton&#x2019;s vision put him at odds with his archrivals who envisioned a pastoral America of small towns, where governments were local, states would control their own destiny, and the federal government would remain small and weak.<br> &nbsp;<br> The disputes that arose during America&#x2019;s first decades continued through American history to our present day. Over time, because of the systems Hamilton set up and the ideas he left, his vision won out. Here is the story that epitomizes the American dream&#x2014;a poor immigrant who made good in America. In the end, Hamilton rose from poverty through his intelligence and ability, and did more to shape our country than any of his contemporaries.<br><br> Related subjects and concepts discussed in the book include:<br> &nbsp;<br>Law and Legal Concepts<br> Due process<br> Bill of Rights<br> Freedom of Speech and the Press<br> Originalism / nonoriginalism (theories of Constitutional interpretation)<br> &nbsp;<br>Government<br> Checks and Balances<br> Democracy<br> Electoral College<br> Republic<br> &nbsp;<br>Financial Concepts<br> Capitalism<br> Credit<br> Inflation<br> Interest<br> Mercantilism<br> Securities: Stocks and Bonds<br> Tariffs<br> Taxes<br> &nbsp;<br>Miscellaneous<br> Demagogues<br> Dueling<br> Pastoralism<br><br><b>About the Series</b><br>The Making of America series traces the constitutional history of the United States through overlapping biographies of American men and women. The debates that raged when our nation was founded have been argued ever since: How should the Constitution be interpreted? What is the meaning, and where are the limits of personal liberty? What is the proper role of the federal government? Who should be included in &#x201c;we the people&#x201d;? Each biography in the series tells the story of an American leader who helped shape the United States of today.</p><p><b>Teri Kanefield</b> is a lawyer and writer. Her books for children have won numerous awards and distinctions, including the Jane Addams Peace Award in the Older Readers category. She lives with her family in San Francisco, California.<br>Gr 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;Kanefield has produced an informative yet accessible biography of the famed Founding Father for a middle school audience. The narrative begins with Alexander Hamilton's often difficult youth in the West Indies, where he gained his first lessons in the power of finance. The text covers his departure to school in Colonial New York City, his rising star during the American Revolution, his role in the development of the Constitution, and his fateful duel with Aaron Burr. Readers gain an appreciation for the messy political feuds that followed the Revolution, particularly between the Federalists and the anti-Federalists. Hamilton's crucial role as an industrial, capitalistic visionary is fully explored. Kanefield succeeds in revealing the differences among the various political and economic philosophies during the early decades of the American Republic, including the distinction between Hamilton's mercantilism and Thomas Jefferson's agrarianism. Relevant paintings from the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries are presented throughout. These portraits, landscapes, and architectural images range in size from one-quarter of a page to a full page. Scans of primary documents, such as Hamilton's commission as treasury secretary, are also included. Key concepts, like the Articles of Confederation and mercantilism, are explained in sidebars. Some details, such as investments, loans, and bonds&#x2014;which played a critical role in Hamilton's philosophy&#x2014;can be difficult to grasp, and some readers may need further clarification. VERDICT Considering the staggering popularity of the Broadway musical Hamilton, students will crave this title. A great addition to upper elementary and middle school libraries.&#x2014;Jeffrey Meyer, Mount Pleasant Public Library, IA</p><h2>I Love Dirt!: 52 Activities to Help You and Your Kids Discover the Wonders of Nature</h2><p><i>I Love Dirt!</i> presents 52 open-ended activities to help you engage your child in the outdoors.

Preserved intact for centuries by the permafrost, these mediaeval garments display remarkable similarities to western European costumes of the time. Previously, such costumes were known only from contemporary illustrations, and the Greenland finds provided the world with a close look at how ordinary Europeans dressed in the Middle Ages. Fortunately for Norlund&#39;s team, wood has always been extremely scarce in Greenland, and instead of caskets, many of the bodies were found swaddled in multiple layers of cast off clothing. When he wrote about the excavation later, Norlund also described how occasional thaws had permitted crowberry and dwarf willow to establish themselves in the top layers of soil. Their roots grew through coffins, clothing and corpses alike, binding them together in a vast network of thin fibers - as if, he wrote, the finds had been literally sewn in the earth. Eighty years of technical advances and subsequent excavations have greatly added to our understanding of the Herjolfsnaes discoveries. Woven into the Earth recounts the dramatic story of Norlund&#39;s excavation in the context of other Norse textile finds in Greenland. It then describes what the finds tell us about the materials and methods used in making the clothes. The weaving and sewing techniques detailed here are surprisingly sophisticated, and one can only admire the talent of the women who employed them, especially considering the harsh conditions they worked under. While Woven into the Earth will be invaluable to students of medieval archaeology, Norse society and textile history, both lay readers and scholars are sure to find the book&#39;s dig narratives and glimpses of life among &#34;the last Vikings&#34; fascinating.</p><p></p><h2>Reading Autobiography: A Guide for Interpreting Life Narratives, Second Edition</h2><p>With the memoir boom, life storytelling has become ubiquitous and emerged as a distinct field of study. <i>Reading Autobiography</i>, originally published in 2001, was the first comprehensive critical introduction to life writing in all its forms. Widely adopted for undergraduate and graduate-level courses, it is an essential guide for students and scholars reading and interpreting autobiographical texts and methods across the humanities, social sciences, and visual and performing arts.&nbsp;Thoroughly updated, the second edition of <i>Reading Autobiography</i> is the most complete assessment of life narrative in its myriad forms. It lays out a sophisticated, theoretical approach to life writing and the components of autobiographical acts, including memory, experience, identity, embodiment, space, and agency. Sidonie Smith and Julia Watson explore these components, review the history of life writing and the foundations of autobiographical subjectivity, and provide a toolkit for working with twenty-three key concepts. Their survey of innovative forms of life writing, such as autographics and installation self-portraiture, charts recent shifts in autobiographical practice. Especially useful for courses are the appendices: a glossary covering dozens of distinct genres of life writing, proposals for group and classroom projects, and an extensive bibliography.</p><p><p>Sidonie Smith is Martha Guernsey Colby Collegiate Professor of English and Women&#x2019;s Studies at the University of Michigan.</p><p>Julia Watson is professor of comparative studies at Ohio State University.</p></p><h2>One Wrong Step (Borderline)</h2><p><b> SHE NEVER PLANNED TO GET INVOLVED WITH HER EX AGAIN, ESPECIALLY NOT IN HIS MURDER.... </b> <br> <br> But that's just what happens when Celie Wells has an encounter with her former husband, and he turns up dead an hour later.

Fortunately, Melanie -- or was it Mallory? -- lived in one of the nicer parts of town, not far from the business district where the <i>Mayfield Gazette</i> was headquartered. John had left her bed moments ago, jotted a quick note, and heard her shuffling in the bedroom as he'd slipped out the front door. He didn't like mornings after, and the combination of too much tequila and not enough sleep had made this one a narrow escape. </p><p> John glanced in the backseat, and, hot damn, his luck was holding. The dry cleaning he'd picked up on his way to happy hour yesterday hadn't been stolen, rained on, or mutilated in the bar parking lot or Melinda's -- that was her name -- driveway. If he avoided traffic snarls and changed shirts on the fly, he might actually show his face at the staff meeting before it adjourned. </p><p> As he pulled up to a stoplight, John stripped off the T-shirt he'd worn last night. He ripped open the plastic dry cleaning bag, shrugged into a crisp white shirt, and buttoned up. He was about to unzip his jeans and tuck in the shirttail when he noticed the young brunette in the red Mustang convertible pulled up beside him. Her mouth hung open as she stared at him with naked admiration. It was a look he usually enjoyed, but the light had turned green, so he settled for giving the woman a friendly wink before shifting into gear. </p><p> Mayfield had a lot going for it. Warm weather. Hot women. A fresh flock of tourists migrating to the beaches every summer. The sun wouldn't hit full, skin-scorching intensity for a few hours yet, and on mornings like this, John was almost glad he lived here. Almost. If it weren't for the increasingly serious shit going down along the border, this place would be paradise. </p><p> As he shifted into fourth, he heard the familiar howl of an approaching police cruiser. Check that -- two police cruisers. Check <i>that</i> -- three or more. </p><p> What the fuck? John pulled over and watched <i>five</i> black-and-whites race by. In the distance he heard yet another emergency vehicle, this one coming from the direction of the closest fire station. </p><p> John followed in the cruisers' wake, cursing himself for leaving his police scanner on his desk overnight. His editor would be pissed. His only shot at redemption would be getting whatever this story was and hoping nothing important had transpired last night while he was burning up the sheets with Melinda. </p><p> The cruisers turned down a street lined with King palms and, set farther back from the curb, expensive brickand-stucco homes. This was an upscale neighborhood, and many of the houses had waterfront views, three-car garages, and boat slips. Whatever this emergency was, it wasn't your typical liquor store holdup. </p><p> The police cars screeched to a halt in front of a white stucco residence, and five pairs of officers hopped out, guns drawn. </p><p> John parked across the street from the house, a Mexican-style three-story with a red tile roof. A gray Volvo SUV was parked in the driveway with one of the back passenger doors open. The cops surrounded it. John climbed out of his Jeep and saw a young officer -- the first responder, most likely -- already kneeling on the driveway next to, holy shit, a <i>body</i>. It looked like a woman in a dark dress, but it was hard to tell for sure. A pool of blood surrounded the mutilated mass that had once been her head. </p><p> John scanned the area for any sign of the gunman, but all he saw were neighbors in bathrobes and warm-ups who had been lured outside by the commotion. Not far up the block, a silver-haired man with a Chihuahua bouncing around his ankles talked to a cop and gestured wildly down the street. John caught the words "black Hummer" and "bat outta hell." His gaze shifted back to the Volvo. A spray of bullet holes perforated the rear fender. </p><p> Shit, a drive-by. </p><p> In this neighborhood? This wasn't gang-on-gang violence. More like someone gunning down a judge or a city official. Not that most city officials lived around here. The mayor had some money, but even he lived several streets over. </p><p> John caught the neighbor's eye. "Hey, you know who lives here?" </p><p> The cop glared at him, but Chihuahua Guy was eager to help out. "The Prices," he said. "Pam and Barry." </p><p> "Thanks." John walked off before the cop could get territorial. </p><p> Pamela Price. The assistant U.S. attorney was currently prosecuting some midlevel members of the Saledo drug cartel. Her murder would spook every law enforcement official in the Rio Grande Valley. </p><p> A shrieking ambulance skidded to a halt in front of the house, and two paramedics dashed up the driveway. John approached the crime scene, which was already being secured by several uniforms with rolls of yellow tape. As John watched the paramedics kneel down beside the victim, he realized she wasn't alone. Lying next to her, in a second pool of blood, was another body. </p><p> A little boy. In blood-covered overalls. </p><p> Beside the back tire lay a blue-and-red Spider-Man backpack. Pamela Price must have been buckling her kid into his car seat when the Hummer came by, and the fuckers had shot them both. </p><p> One of the medics strapped an oxygen mask over the boy's face while the other scrambled to stanch the bleeding. Blood was everywhere, turning the paramedics' latex gloves scarlet and forming an ever- expanding puddle around the mother and child. </p><p> John's stomach turned. He spotted a cluster of trash cans and raced over just in time to puke his guts up. He crouched down, leaning a hand against the neighbor's house. The smell of vomit and garbage filled his nostrils, and the humidity closed in on him. He was going to hurl again if he didn't get some air. </p><p> A low hedge separated the Prices' property from their neighbors'. John walked into the adjacent backyard and plunked himself down on a patio chair in front of a weathered boathouse. He took a deep breath and tried to spit out the vile taste in his mouth. </p><p> Damn, what was wrong with him? He'd covered the crime beat for nearly a decade now. He'd been to countless homicide scenes; he'd seen corpses. </p><p> He thought of the Spidey backpack and shuddered. He needed a cigarette. </p><p> Something mewed, and John glanced around, expecting a cat. No cat, but the noise continued, growing louder every second. The mewing gave way to something vaguely human, and John stood up. Low, keening noises were coming from the boathouse. </p><p> The tide was out, and the wooden decking surrounding the boat slip stood several feet out of the water. Four pilings supported the structure, which had a sundeck on top. The boat slip was empty except for two nylon straps flapping in the wind. </p><p> A flash of pink behind the nearest piling caught his eye. </p><p> "Hello?" he called. </p><p> The noises stopped. John glimpsed some brown hair a few feet off the ground. A child. </p><p> He stepped closer. "Anyone there?" </p><p> The hair didn't belong to a child, but to a doll. The doll came into view and, attached to it, the white-knuckled hand of a little girl. She was slack-jawed, trembling, and staring at John with huge brown eyes. Her little body was shaking so violently, the doll looked like it was having a seizure. </p><p> It took him a second to notice the blood splatters all over her pink dress. He rushed forward. </p><p> "Are you hurt?" </p><p> She lurched back, nearly falling off the dock. </p><p> <i>Shit.</i> </p><p> He didn't want to scare her into the bay. Slowly this time, he stepped toward her. She stepped back again, not even noticing she was inches from the edge. </p><p> Could she swim? He had no fucking idea. She looked about four, maybe a tall three. She was about the same height as one of his nieces, and she had long brown pigtails. He studied the blood on her dress. It didn't seem to be coming from her. More likely it was her mother's blood, or her brother's. </p><p> What should he do here? He knew jack shit about kids. </p><p> He needed to get help. But what if she fell in while he was gone? What if she couldn't swim? What if that wasn't her mother's blood and this girl was injured? </p><p> She moved closer to the piling, wrapping an arm around it and squeezing her eyes shut. She started the freaky animal sound again. </p><p> Cautiously, he stepped onto the dock. A plank creaked under his foot, and her eyes flew open. She looked at him, then over his shoulder at what was probably her house. John hoped she didn't have a line of sight to the ambulance. </p><p> She clutched the doll closer to her chest. </p><p> He'd seen the doll before, or something like it, at his sister's place. His niece's doll carried around a purple backpack and spoke Spanish. What the hell was its name? Dyna. Dyna the Adventurer or something like that. </p><p> "Is that...Dora you've got there?" Dora the Explorer. Damn, he'd pulled that out of his ass. </p><p> She looked from him to the doll and nodded. The noise stopped. </p><p> John crouched down. "My niece has a doll like that. Her name's Hannah. What's your name?" </p><p> She didn't answer. But she didn't move toward the water, either, so he took that as encouragement. Sweat slid down his temples, and his jeans and boots were streaked with vomit. He probably looked pretty frightening to this kid. </p><p> "Hey!" </p><p> John whirled around. A cop was jogging toward him, reaching for his holster. John held up his hand. </p><p> "Don't come closer!" </p><p> The cop drew his gun anyway. John darted a look at the girl. Her eyes bugged out, and a trickle of fluid ran down her leg. She started keening again. </p><p> "You're scaring her!" John yelled. "Put that away! Please? I think she's hurt, and I'm trying to get her off this dock." </p><p> The cop hesitated a moment, then holstered the weapon. But the kid still looked terrified, and John wanted the cop out of her sight. </p><p> "We need a paramedic," John told ...</p></p><h2>More Chess Openings: Traps and Zaps 2 (Fireside Chess Library)</h2><p>Presents over two hundred chess openings arranged by classical variations and by level of difficulty</p><p>Bruce Pandolfini, a National Master in U.S. chess competition, is the creator of the highly acclaimed Fireside Chess Library.

The manuscript passed through many hands before finally being compiled into a book by bookseller and scholar BERTRAM DOBELL (1842-1914) in 1908. Centuries is a collection of poems written to express the rapture of life lived in accordance with God. Yet Dobell is careful to state that even though Traherne was a clergyman, there is plenty of beauty to be found in his poetry that does not require specific belief in Christianity or in God. Readers of many ages and persuasions will be touched by Traherne&#39;s passages on love and belonging. English author THOMAS TRAHERNE (1636-1674) received a master&#39;s degree in arts and divinity from Brasenose College, Oxford. He worked as a parish priest in Credenhill and wrote a handful of books, including Christian Ethicks (1675) and Roman Forgeries (1673).</p><p></p><h2>Healing the Eight Stages of Life</h2><p>A practical and prayerful guide to healing the hurt that may have occurred in the eight stages of life as described by psychologist Erik Erikson.</p><p>Dennis, Sheila, and Matt Linn have given retreats and seminars on processes for healing in over fifty countries and in many universities and hospitals, including a course to doctors accredited by the American Medical Association, Dennis and Matt are co-authors of twenty-one books, the last sixteen co-authored with Sheila. These books have sold over a million copies in English and have been translated into more than twenty different languages.Erik Erikson's eight-stage theory of the human life-cycle is starting to receive the attention it deserves from spiritual writers. This book is especially exciting, given the popularity of its authors in the charismatic/inner healing community and its fresh, jargon-free style. Devoting one chapter to each stage, the authors share personal memories (both positive and negative) and discuss the kinds of prayer that naturally emerge from the successful resolution of characteristic developmental crisis.

"Death as a Friend," showing a man greeting his death as an old friend, with a hysterical mixture of joy and terror. "The People," in which a mother shields her offspring from phantoms of hate, poverty, and ignorance &#x2014; and symbolizes woman as creator, begetter of the human race, link between past and future.<br>These works represent the recurrent themes which most characterize the work of K�the Kollwitz: social consciousness and a sense of the suffering of mankind, an urge to voice the basic maternal attitude, and a preoccupation with death. She has been called a propagandist, a crusader, yet her art is essentially apolitical. Her concern was not with partisan causes, but rather with universal rights.<br>Fundamentally a dramatic artist, K�the Kollwitz (1867&#x2013;1945) brought to each of her works an uncanny ability to evoke human emotions through subtle gestures and facial expressions. The reactions of her characters were psychologically true primarily because she tested them on herself.<br>The present collection contains 83 of Mrs. Kollwitz's finest works, including the last great print cycles: "The Weavers" of 1898; "The Peasant War" of 1908; "War" of 1925; and "Death" of 1935. These selections provide a full panorama of Mrs. Kollwitz's development as a master of the graphic techniques of etching, woodcutting and lithography. Over 69 of the illustrations have been rephotographed from the original works specially for this edition, and new techniques in photolithography and a larger format have resulted in reproductions that are as close as possible to the prints and drawings themselves.</p></p><p></p><h2>Peace Came in the Form of a Woman: Indians and Spaniards in the Texas Borderlands</h2><p>Revising the standard narrative of European-Indian relations in America, Juliana Barr reconstructs a world in which Indians were the dominant power and Europeans were the ones forced to accommodate, resist, and persevere. She demonstrates that between the 1690s and 1780s, Indian peoples including Caddos, Apaches, Payayas, Karankawas, Wichitas, and Comanches formed relationships with Spaniards in Texas that refuted European claims of imperial control.<br><br>Barr argues that Indians not only retained control over their territories but also imposed control over Spaniards. Instead of being defined in racial terms, as was often the case with European constructions of power, diplomatic relations between the Indians and Spaniards in the region were dictated by Indian expressions of power, grounded in gendered terms of kinship. By examining six realms of encounter--first contact, settlement and intermarriage, mission life, warfare, diplomacy, and captivity--Barr shows that native categories of gender provided the political structure of Indian-Spanish relations by defining people's identity, status, and obligations vis-a-vis others. Because native systems of kin-based social and political order predominated, argues Barr, Indian concepts of gender cut across European perceptions of racial difference.<br><br></p><p>"This monumental work on the diplomatic, military, and colonial history of Spanish Texas combines careful archival research with theoretical sophistication about the ways gender served as an idiom for the power struggles between Spaniards and local Indian populations throughout the long eighteenth century. With a richly crafted narrative and lively prose, it is an amazing achievement."--Kathleen M. Brown, University of Pennsylvania <br>Juliana Barr is Research Foundation Professor of History at the University of Florida.</p><h2>After the Ice : A Global Human History 20,000-5000 Bc</h2><p>A fantastic voyage through 15,000 years of history that laid the foundations for civilisation as we know it by award-winning science writer Steven Mithen. Twenty thousand years ago Earth was in the midst of an ice age. Then global warming arrived, leading to massive floods, the spread of forests and the retreat of the deserts. By 5,000 BC a radically different human world had appeared. In place of hunters and gatherers there were farmers; in place of transient campsites there were towns. The foundations of our modern world had been laid and nothing that came after - the Industrial Revolution, the atomic age, the internet - have ever matched the significance of those events. AFTER THE ICE tells the story of climate change&#39;s impact during this momentous period - one that also saw the colonisation of the Americas and mass extinctions of animals throughout the world. Drawing on the latest cutting-edge research in archaeology, cognitive science, palaeontology, geology and the evolutionary sciences, Steven Mithen creates an evocative, original and remarkably complete picture of minds, cultures, lives and landscapes through 15,000 years of history.</p><p>Steven Mithen is Professor of Early Prehistory and Head of the School of Human and Environmental Sciences at the University of Reading.Using an unorthodox narrative device, Mithen explores why, how, and where farming displaced hunting and gathering. Mithen conjures John Lubbock, an English author of a once-popular 1865 history of the Stone Age, and sends him back in time to visit dozens of excavation sites around the world as they appeared when inhabited. Lubbock's transcontinental perambulations permit Mithen (a practicing archaeologist who describes his digs in Scotland) to underscore one causal factor in the agricultural revolution: the fluctuations of climate at the end of the last Ice Age. Weather, sea level, and zones of plant and animal life changed dramatically in the 15,000 years of Lubbock's walkabout, and Mithen explains how environmental volatility is scientifically known as he sketches Lubbock observing the various "living" human communities that have been uncovered. A successful marriage of fact and imagination, Mithen's tome establishes a solid knowledge base with full academic references that will be of primary interest to those considering a career in archaeology. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He is on his way to live with his grandmother and sister in Pennsylvania. Along the way, he will learn that sometimes caring, guidance and understanding can come from some unlikely people. <p>Marcus, a fellow bus passenger, is a man who has been neglected more by society than his family. As a young black ex-con, he is not the epitome of the person most would pick as a chaperone for their child's cross country trip. Yet rather than be held apart by their differences, Marcus and Sebastien are drawn together by the things that make us all alike. </p><p>Along the way, he acts as both guide and protector, as Virgil was to Dante and Jim to Huck Finn. Imparting his own style of wisdom, he shows Sebastien that, despite the darker parts of the human condition, people can and do care for one another. This is a modern day journey not just from one house to another. This is a journey taken by a young boy into manhood, and by the reader into his world. Like every trip, there are many stops along the way. But this journey differs in the way young Sebastien arrives at his destination. Greyhound is the story of this journey.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: A Q&amp;A with Steffan Piper</strong> <br> <br> <strong>Question:</strong> What is <em>Greyhound</em> about? <p></p> <p><strong>Steffan Piper:</strong> <em>Greyhound</em> is the story of an 11-year-old boy named Sebastien Ranes who is abandoned by his mother. As the book opens, we find her dropping him off in the Stockton, California Greyhound bus station to travel across the country, unaccompanied, to live with his grandmother in Altoona, Pennsylvania--over 2,500 miles away.</p> <p>Most of the experiences that are in the book are events that actually have taken place in my life. I&#x2019;ve been working on <em>Greyhound</em>, both in my head and on paper, for about 25 years. I have boxes of journals in my garage detailing many of the stories that are in the book, thoughts I had back then when I was travelling back and forth by bus, and other small details.</p> <p>Writing about my experiences within the confines of 300 pages wasn&#x2019;t so easy, but I felt compelled to write about those days. Those years were a very difficult time for me, and pulling a lot of those feelings forward again brought out a lot of emotions that I had buried.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> Is the Marcus Franklin character based on a real person?</p> <p> <strong>Steffan Piper:</strong> Marcus was a real person that I met on the bus. I&#x2019;ve thought quite a bit about my encounter with him and the conversations that we had into the middle of the night. When you&#x2019;re young, it&#x2019;s the simplest and kindest of gestures that have the most effect and create the most lasting memories. A bag of pretzels can be the equivalent of much more over the passage of time. Not having good role models growing up, I often found myself reaching outward for a guide. Those are often the most dangerous because they have a limit as to what they can give back to you. Those limits are not always visible, especially when you&#x2019;re young.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> Why did you set the book in 1981?</p> <p><strong>Steffan Piper:</strong> I set the book in 1981 because it was a period where life was very different than it is today, and is different in more ways than can be imagined in books or through culture. Some people may not remember it that well, or may not have lived through it, but many have. The most important facet of that time was that it was the beginning of the modern world as we now know it. </p> <p>The eighties was an era of "analog communication" versus what we have today, which is digital. From telephones to records, everything was analog. People were&nbsp;forced&nbsp;to make more direct links with each other; to reach out, touch and feel the world around them. There was a need to verify the space in front of them. Today&#x2019;s world seems to ask us repeatedly to do the opposite and not verify our world at all.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> Some of the material in the book is pretty heady for an 11-year-old boy turning 12. Got anything to say about that?&nbsp; </p> <p><strong>Steffan Piper:</strong> I grew up in England and I&#x2019;m the product of the British educational system, so that will always have an influence on everything that I write.</p> <p>When I was ten, Sherlock Holmes was my all-time hero. Maybe it was the ease in how he held himself that I found appealing. I think it was the same for Dickens's Twist as well. These were themes I very quickly recognized and latched onto at that age. Shortly after that, when I was 12, reading Carlos Castaneda's books definitely changed my life. The idea of releasing and letting go of your self-image, during a period of my life where I was supposed to be finding that out, was alluring. I gripped onto Castaneda for dear life for about four or five years. I read those books so many times, I probably scared a few counselors at school.</p> <p>I think when we start thinking as adults that we need to limit material to what we believe young people are capable of, or is normal to them, we immediately have done them a disservice, because most of them would probably shame us in regards to what we know, or think we know.</p>Sebastien Rane's single mom and her feckless boyfriend can't be bothered to take care of a stuttering twelve-year old. Banished to live with his grandmother on the far side of the country, the boy can barely understand a bus schedule when he gets dumped at the Greyhound station in Stockton, California. Given $35 and a one-way ticket to Altoona, Pennsylvania, Sebastien must cross the country - alone, without a clue how to fend for himself.<br> Filled with youthful anger and naievete, Sebastien heads out into the "Morning of America" of Ronald Reagan's 1980's, encountering temperamental bus drivers, charming, shifty and downright dangerous strangers, the music of Daryl Hall and John Oates, and an ex-con named Marcus, who takes the boy under his wing. In an unforgettable trek that evokes <i>Oliver Twist</i> and <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>, the unlikely pair lurch forward from one misadventure to another, tumbling toward an elusive understanding of where and how, in a troubling world, to look for light.</p><h2>The Ecology of Human Development: Experiments by Nature and Design</h2><p>To understand the way children develop, Bronfenbrenner believes that it is necessary to observe their behavior in natural settings, while they are interacting with familiar adults over prolonged periods of time.

Constant contact with the races who continued to embrace emotion made it much harder to hold on to their own conditioning.</p><p>It was a logical thought.</p><p>However, it proved impossible in practice. Economics alone made isolation an unfeasible goal&#x2014;Psy might have all been linked into the PsyNet, the sprawling psychic network that anchored their minds, but they were not all equal. Some were rich, some were poor, and some were just getting by.</p><p>They needed jobs, needed money, needed food. And the Psy Council, for all its brutal power, could not provide enough internal positions for millions. The Psy had to remain part of the world, a world filled with chaos on every side, bursting at the seams with the extremes of joy and sadness, fear and despair. Those Psy who fractured under the pressure were quietly &#x201c;rehabilitated,&#x201d; their minds wiped, their personalities erased. But others thrived.</p><p>The M-Psy, gifted with the ability to look inside the body and diagnose illnesses, had never really withdrawn from the world. Their skills were prized by all three races, and they brought in a good income.</p><p>The less-powerful members of the Psy populace returned to their ordinary, everyday jobs as accountants and engineers, shop owners and businessmen.

Now, in the dawn of the year 2081, the Js are so much a part of the Justice system that their presence raises no eyebrows, causes no ripples.</p><p>And, as for the unexpected mental consequences of long-term work as a J . . . well, the benefits outweigh the occasional murderous problem.</p><p><b>CHAPTER 1</b></p><p><i>Circumstance doesn&#x2019;t make a man. If it did, I&#x2019;d have committed my first burglary at twelve, my first robbery at fifteen, and my first murder at seventeen.</i><br>&#x2014;From the private case notes of Detective Max Shannon</p><p>It was as she was sitting staring into the face of a socio�path that Sophia Russo realized three irrefutable truths.</p><p>One: In all likelihood, she had less than a year left before she was sentenced to comprehensive rehabilitation. Unlike normal rehabilitation, the process wouldn&#x2019;t only wipe out her personality, leave her a drooling vegetable. Comprehensives had ninety-nine percent of their psychic senses fried as well. All for their own good of course.</p><p>Two: Not a single individual on this earth would remem�ber her name after she disappeared from active duty.</p><p>Three: If she wasn&#x2019;t careful, she would soon end up as empty and as inhuman as the man on the other side of the table . . . because the otherness in her wanted to squeeze his mind until he whimpered, until he bled, until he begged for mercy.</p><p><i>Evil is hard to define, but it&#x2019;s sitting in that room.</i></p><p>The echo of Detective Max Shannon&#x2019;s words pulled her back from the whispering temptation of the abyss. For some reason, the idea of being labeled evil by him was . . . not acceptable. He had looked at her in a different way from other human males, his eyes noting her scars, but only as part of the package that was her body. The response had been extraordinary enough to make her pause, meet his gaze, attempt to divine what he was thinking.</p><p>That had proved impossible. But she knew what Max Shannon wanted.</p><p><i>Bonner alone knows where he buried the bodies&#x2014;we need that information.</i></p><p>Shutting the door on the darkness inside of her, she opened her psychic eye and, reaching out with her telepathic senses, began to walk the twisted pathways of Gerard Bonner&#x2019;s mind. She had touched many, many depraved minds over the course of her career, but this one was utterly and absolutely unique. Many who committed crimes of this caliber had a mental illness of some kind. She understood how to work with their sometimes disjointed and fragmented memories.</p><p>Bonner&#x2019;s mind, in contrast, was neat, organized, each memory in its proper place. Except those places and the memories they contained made no sense, having been filtered through the cold lens of his sociopathic desires. He saw things as he wished to see them, the reality distorted until it was impossible to pinpoint the truth among the spiderweb of lies.</p><p>Ending the telepathic sweep, she took three discreet seconds to center herself before opening her physical eyes to stare into the rich blue irises of the man the media found so compelling. According to them, he was handsome, intelligent, magnetic. What she knew for a fact was that he held an MBA from a highly regarded institution and came from one of the premier human families in Boston&#x2014;there was a prevailing sense of disbelief that he was also the Butcher of Park Avenue, the moniker coined after the discovery of Carissa White&#x2019;s body along one of the avenue&#x2019;s famous wide &#x201c;green&#x201d; medians.</p><p>Covered with tulips and daffodils in spring, it had been a snowy wonderland of trees and fairy lights when Carissa was dumped there, her blood a harsh accent on the snow. She was the only one of Bonner&#x2019;s victims to have ever been found, and the public nature of the dump site had turned her killer into an instant star. It had also almost gotten him caught&#x2014;only the fact that the witness who&#x2019;d seen him running from the scene had been too far away to give Enforcement any kind of a useful description had saved the monster.</p><p>&#x201c;I got much more careful after that,&#x201d; Bonner said, wearing the faint smile that made people think they were being invited to share a secret joke. &#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s a little clumsy the first time.&#x201d;</p><p>Sophia betrayed no reaction to the fact that the human across from her had just &#x201c;read her mind,&#x201d; having expected the trick. According to his file, Gerard Bonner was a master manipulator, able to read body language cues and minute facial expressions to genius-level accuracy. Even Silence, it seemed, was not protection enough against his abilities&#x2014;having reviewed the visual transcripts of his trial, she&#x2019;d seen him do the same thing to other Psy.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re here, Mr. Bonner,&#x201d; she said with a calm that was growing ever colder, ever more remote&#x2014;a survival mechanism that would soon chill the few remaining splinters of her soul. &#x201c;You agreed to give up the locations of your later victims&#x2019; bodies in return for more privileges during your incarceration.&#x201d; Bonner&#x2019;s sentence meant he&#x2019;d be spending the rest of his natural life in D2, a maximum security facility located deep in the mountainous interior of Wyoming. Created under a special mandate, D2 housed the most vicious inmates from around the country, those deemed too high risk to remain in the normal prison system.</p><p>&#x201c;I like your eyes,&#x201d; Bonner said, his smile widening as he traced the network of fine lines on her face with a gaze the media had labeled &#x201c;murderously sensual.&#x201d; &#x201c;They remind me of pansies.&#x201d;</p><p>Sophia simply waited, letting him speak, knowing his words would be of interest to the profilers who stood in the room on the other side of the wall at her back&#x2014;observing her meeting with Bonner on a large comm screen. Unusually for a human criminal, there were Psy observers in that group. Bonner&#x2019;s mental patterns were so aberrant as to incite their interest.</p><p>But no matter the credentials of those Psy profilers, Max Shannon&#x2019;s conclusions were the ones that interested Sophia. The Enforcement detective had no Psy abilities, and unlike the butcher sitting across from her, his body was whipcord lean. Sleek, she thought, akin to a lithely muscled puma. Yet, when it came down to it, it was the puma who&#x2019;d won&#x2014;both over the bulging strength that strained at Bonner&#x2019;s prison overalls, <i>and</i> over the mental abilities of the Psy detectives who&#x2019;d been enlisted into the task force once Bonner&#x2019;s perversions began to have a serious economic impact.</p><p>&#x201c;They were my pansies, you know.&#x201d; A small sigh. &#x201c;So pretty, so sweet. So easily bruised. Like you.&#x201d; His eyes lingered on a scar that ran a ragged line over her cheekbone.</p><p>Ignoring the blatant attempt at provocation, she said, &#x201c;What did you do to bruise them?&#x201d; Bonner had ultimately been convicted on the basis of the evidence he&#x2019;d left on the battered and broken body of his first victim. He hadn&#x2019;t left a trace at the scenes of the other abductions, had been connected to them only by the most circumstantial of evidence&#x2014;and Max Shannon&#x2019;s relentless persistence.</p><p>&#x201c;So delicate and so damaged you are, Sophia,&#x201d; he murmured, moving his gaze across her cheek, down to her lips. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always been drawn to damaged women.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A lie, Mr. Bonner.&#x201d; It was extraordinary to her that people found him handsome&#x2014;when she could all but smell the rot. &#x201c;Every one of your victims was remarkably beautiful.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Alleged</i> victims,&#x201d; he said, eyes sparkling. &#x201c;I was only convicted of poor Carissa&#x2019;s murder. Though I&#x2019;m innocent, of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You agreed to cooperate,&#x201d; she reminded him. And she needed that cooperation to do her job. Because&#x2014;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s obvious you&#x2019;ve learned to control your thought patterns to a certain degree.&#x201d; It was something the telepaths in the J-Corps had noted in a number of human sociopaths&#x2014;they seemed to develop an almost Psy ability to consciously manipulate their own memories. Bonner had learned to do it well enough that she couldn&#x2019;t get what she needed from a surface scan&#x2014;to go deeper, dig harder might cause permanent damage, erasing the very impressions she needed to access.</p><p>But, the otherness in her murmured, he only had to remain alive until they located his victims. After that . . .</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m human.&#x201d; Exaggerated surprise. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure they told you&#x2014;my memory&#x2019;s not what it used to be. That&#x2019;s why I need a J to go in and dig up my pansies.&#x201d;</p><p>It was a game. She was certain he knew the exact position of each discarded body down to the last centimeter of dirt on a shallow grave. But he&#x2019;d played the game well enough that the authorities had pulled her in, giving Bonner the chance to sate his urges once again. By making her go into his mind, he was attempting to violate her&#x2014;the sole way he had to hurt a woman now.</p><p>&#x201c;Since it&#x2019;s obvious I&#x2019;m ineffective,&#x201d; she said, rising to her feet, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get Justice to send in my colleague, Bryan Ames. He&#x2019;s an&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; The first trace of a crack in his polished veneer, covered over almost as soon as it appeared. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll get what you need.&#x201d;</p><p>She tugged at the thin black leather-synth of her left glove, smoothing it over her wrist so it sat neatly below the cuff of her crisp white shirt. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m too expensive a resource to waste. My skills will be better utilized in other cases.&#x201d; Then she walked out, ignoring his order&#x2014;and it was an order&#x2014;that she stay.</p><p>Once out in the observation chamber, she turned to Max Shannon. &#x201c;Make sure any replacements you send him are male.&#x201d;</p><p>A professional nod, but his hand clenched on the top of the chairback beside him, his skin having the warm golden brown tone of someone whose ancestry appeared to be a mix of Asian and Caucasian. While the Asian side of his genetic structure had made itself known in the shape of his eyes, the Caucasian side had won in the height department&#x2014;he was six foot one according to her visual estimate.</p><p>All that was fact.</p><p>But the impact was more than the sum of its parts. He had, she realized, that strange something the humans called charisma. Psy professed not to accept that such a thing existed, but they all knew it did. Even among their Silent race, there were those who could walk into a room and hold it with nothing but their presence.</p><p>As she watched, Max&#x2019;s tendons turned white against his skin from the force of his grip. &#x201c;He got his rocks off making you trawl through his memories.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t say anything about her scars, but Sophia knew as well as he did that they played a large part in what made her so very attractive to Bonner.</p><p>Those scars had long ago become a part of her, a thin tracery of lines that spoke of a history, a past. Without them, she&#x2019;d have no past at all. Max Shannon, she thought, had a past as well. But he didn&#x2019;t wear it on that beautiful&#x2014;not handsome, <i>beautiful</i>&#x2014;face. &#x201c;I have shields.&#x201d; However, those shields were beginning to fail, an inevitable side effect of her occupation. If she&#x2019;d had the option, she wouldn&#x2019;t have become a J. But at eight years of age, she&#x2019;d been given a single choice&#x2014;become a J or die.</p><p>&#x201c;I heard a lot of J-Psy have eidetic memories,&#x201d; Max said, his eyes intent.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes&#x2014;but only when it comes to the images we take during the course of our work.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d forgotten parts of her &#x201c;real life,&#x201d; but she&#x2019;d never forget even an instant of the things she&#x2019;d seen over the years she&#x2019;d spent in the Justice Corps.</p><p>Max had opened his mouth to reply when Bartholomew Reuben, the prosecutor who&#x2019;d worked side by side with him to capture and convict Gerard Bonner, finished his conversation with two of the profilers and walked over. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a good idea about male Js. It&#x2019;ll give Bonner time to stew&#x2014;we can bring you in again when he&#x2019;s in a more cooperative frame of mind.&#x201d;</p><p>Max&#x2019;s jaw set at a brutal angle as he responded. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll draw this out as long as possible&#x2014;those girls are nothing but pawns to him.&#x201d;</p><p>Reuben was pulled away by another profiler before he could reply, leaving Sophia alone with Max again. She found herself staying in place though she should&#x2019;ve joined those of her race, her task complete. But being perfect hadn&#x2019;t kept her safe&#x2014;she&#x2019;d be dead within the year, one way or another&#x2014;so why not indulge her desire for further conversation with this human detective whose mind worked in a fashion that fascinated her? &#x201c;His ego won&#x2019;t let him hide his secrets forever,&#x201d; she said, having dealt with that kind of a narcissistic personality before. &#x201c;He wants to share his cleverness.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And will you continue to listen if the first body he gives up is that of Daria Xiu?&#x201d; His tone was abrasive, gritty with lack of sleep.</p><p>Daria Xiu, Sophia knew, was the reason a J had been pulled into this situation. The daughter of a powerful human businessman, she was theorized to have been Bonner&#x2019;s final victim. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said, telling him one truth. &#x201c;Bonner is deviant enough that our psychologists find him a worthwhile study subject.&#x201d; Perhaps because the kind of deviancy exhibited by the Butcher of Park Avenue had once been exhibited by P...</p></p><h2>Exploring the Worship Spectrum: Six Views (Counterpoints)</h2><p><p>What does worship look like? Is there just one truly right way to worship? Are there any wrong ways? To what extent should our unity as believers manifest itself in unified public worship? Sadly, disagreement over how we should worship our loving God has sparked some most unloving attitudes among Christians. Exploring the Worship Spectrum seeks to correct this. It provides a forum for presentation, critique, and defense of six prominent worship styles: �Formal-Liturgical &#x2013; Paul Zahl �Traditional Hymn-Based &#x2013; Harold Best �Contemporary Music-Driven &#x2013; Joe Horness �Charismatic &#x2013; Don Williams �Blended &#x2013; Robert Webber �Emerging &#x2013; Sally Morgenthaler This unique format allows those with a heart for worship to compare different perspectives and draw their own conclusions on what the Bible teaches. It engages the reader&#x2019;s faculties of critical thinking in a way that allows him or her to understand the various approaches to worship, carefully evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, and make personal choices without adopting a judgmental spirit. The Counterpoints series provides a forum for comparison and critique of different views on issues important to Christians.

Zahl &#39;It was during Dr. Bedell&#39;s ministry and well into the 1860s that the Church of the Ascension was called the &#39;Low Church Cathedral,&#39; because, while its pulpit stood for a broad evangelical Christianity, it was marked by unusual fondness for good music and for a dignified service&#39;. ---James W. Kennedy, The Unknown Worshipper1 I believe in Bible-based verticality, which is another way of saying formal-liturgical worship. There is nothing like it for taking you outside your problems and also bringing you back to them a renewed person, better able to cope and to endure. Biblebased verticality is a glorious thing. This chapter seeks to offer its principles, its roots, and its virtues. It also seeks to parry some familiar objections to it. Formal worship means dignified service that is not governed by the spontaneity of the moment or the spontaneity of the officiant. It means service in a form, within a mold. It is not off the cuff or as mood would govern. Rather, it accepts the constraint of a consistent and predictable pattern. Liturgical worship means prescribed worship, service that is required for a given occasion. So if it is Sunday, you have a required act of worship for that day. If a baptism is to take place or the sacrament of Holy Communion is to be celebrated, you conduct the service according to a previously set format. You do not make it up as you go along. Thus, for example, Episcopal ministers and most Lutheran pastors approach Sunday without giving particular thought to the shape of the service itself. It is formal (i.e., in the form given in a prayer book) and it is liturgical (i.e., set, depending on whether the service is to be one of the two sacraments or whether it is to be Morning Prayer, a service purely of the Word).2 There is freedom in worship within a form, just as J. S. Bach worked within specific musical forms like the cantata and the Mass, just as Shakespeare worked within the sonnet and Giovanni Bellini within the sacra conversazione and the triptych. Form is able, somewhat counterintuitively, to stimulate fineness and quality, even innovation and renewal, in the context of traditional givens. At the same time, formal-liturgical worship rules out the approach that makes it up as you go along. It is true to say that a high percentage of nonliturgical, nonformal churches ad-lib from Sunday to Sunday. You are not able to know from week to week whether it is going to be a mother-daughter service, a stewardship service, an evangelistic guest service, a youth Sunday, or a Scouting Sunday. F. Scott Fitzgerald was not the first American novelist to write about Americans reinventing themselves. But thousands of churches reinvent the service, or appear to, every Sunday. That, at least, is one burden this writer, as a minister of a liturgical denomination, does not carry. We are concerned here with formal and liturgical worship. We are thereby also concerned with vertical worship. Vertical worship looks up first, before it looks out. It is transcendent before it is horizontal. It is faced north before it looks around. This means that it is not pastor- or preacher-centered. It is, or ought to be, Word-centered. It is not &#39;man/woman&#39;-centered, nor is it concerned, in the initial situation, with community. It does, almost always, engender family feeling. The worship of which I speak is, to use the expressive German, senkrecht nach oben: straight up and down, looking right up. The first principles, then, of formal-liturgical worship are its setness, its givenness, and its direction. It is not informal, it is not nonliturgical, and it is not horizontal. Nor, however, is it cold. Nor is it confining. Nor is it excluding, or non-user-friendly. How can this be? LEX CREDENDI LEX ORANDI Formal-liturgical worship must be based on the truth if it is to endure. In fact, if it is not based on the truth, it will finally fall down in pieces on the ground. If vertical worship is not rooted and grounded in truth, specifically Bible truth, then it should not stand. It should &#39;morph&#39; into casual and horizontal worship. The reason why many evangelical and/or Protestant Christians have rejected liturgical worship over the centuries is that they have associated dignity and formality with unbiblical Roman Catholicism or Anglican Catholicism or just high churchianity that seemed to exist at the expense of Christianity. The Latin phrase that covers the philosophy of worship I am presenting here is this: lex credendi lex orandi. That means: What we believe determines how we pray. Quite a few liturgical scholars and theologians today want to reverse the order and write: lex orandi lex credendi, or how we pray (i.e., worship) determines what we believe. There are even some writers who claim that our belief systems come after and follow from our language of praise, whatever that is. This is an entirely opportunistic view of worship, which subordinates truth to practice. Lex orandi lex credendi must be completely rejected. For Anglicans---yet it is important for all Christians who value forms of worship---the lex orandi lex credendi falsehood goes back to a &#39;power play&#39; in the 1970s by which the Reformation anthropology and Reformation Christology of the old sixteenthcentury Anglican prayer book were muted drastically in favor of a more contemporary picture of the Christian faith and the human condition. Anew and very different prayer book was the result for American Episcopalians. As soon as this prayer book was passed by the Episcopal Church&#39;s General Convention (1979), everyone could announce with authority that the prayer book teaches thus and so. But which prayer book? By whose authority? The new one, just achieved? Or the old one, so convincingly and pastorally tested from the 1540s up until the 1970s? And yes, it has come true in experience that twenty-five years of praying the Christian faith in new words and new forms has created a very different church. Those liturgical politicians who piloted the fundamental changes in the 1970s could now observe by the 1990s, with some sad justice: lex orandi lex credendi. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy. Church people who now prayed Sunday after Sunday without the old confessions and penitential prayers became, well, a lot less penitential. The fact is, theology has to precede the act of worship. You pray what you believe, not vice versa.</p><h2>The Akashic Experience: Science and the Cosmic Memory Field</h2><p>Firsthand testimonies by 20 leaders in culture and science of their interactions with the Akashic field <br> <br>� Provides important evidence for the authenticity of nonmaterial contact that human beings have with each other and with the cosmos <br> <br>� Demonstrates that the increasing frequency and intensity of these experiences is evidence of a widespread spiritual resurgence <br> <br>� Includes contributions by Alex Grey, Stanislav Grof, Stanley Krippner, Swami Kriyananda, Edgar Mitchell, and others <br> <br>Knowing or feeling that we are all connected to each other and to the cosmos by more than our eyes and ears is not a new notion but one as old as humanity.

She was at the very center of the rich culture and clashing politics of the twelfth century. Richest marriage prize of the Middle Ages, she was Queen of France as the wife of Louis VII, and went with him on the exciting and disastrous Second Crusade. Inspiration of troubadours and trouv�res, she played a large part in rendering fashionable the Courts of Love and in establishing the whole courtly tradition of medieval times. Divorced from Louis, she married Henry Plantagenet, who became Henry II of England. Her resources and resourcefulness helped Henry win his throne, she was involved in the conflict over Thomas Becket, and, after Henry&#x2019;s death, she handled the affairs of the Angevin empire with a sagacity that brought her the trust and confidence of popes and kings and emperors.</p><p>Having been first a Capet and then a Plantagenet, Queen Eleanor was the central figure in the bitter rivalry between those houses for the control of their continental domains&#x2015;a rivalry that excited the whole period: after Henry&#x2019;s death, her sons, Richard Coeur-de-Lion and John &#x201c;Lackland&#x201d; (of Magna Carta fame), fiercely pursued the feud up to and even beyond the end of the century. But the dynastic struggle of the period was accompanied by other stirrings: the intellectual revolt, the struggle between church and state, the secularization of literature and other arts, the rise of the distinctive urban culture of the great cities. Eleanor was concerned with all the movements, closely connected with all the personages; and she knew every city from London and Paris to Byzantium, Jerusalem, and Rome.</p><p>Amy Kelly&#x2019;s story of the queen&#x2019;s long life&#x2015;the first modern biography&#x2015;brings together more authentic information about her than has ever been assembled before and reveals in Eleanor a greatness of vision, an intelligence, and a political sagacity that have been missed by those who have dwelt on her caprice and frivolity. It also brings to life the whole period in whose every aspect Eleanor and her four kings were so intimately and influentially involved. Miss Kelly tells Eleanor&#x2019;s absorbing story as it has long waited to be told&#x2015;with verve and style and a sense of the quality of life in those times, and yet with a scrupulous care for the historic facts.</p></p><p>Was there ever a ruler, man or woman, quite as fascinating as Eleanor of Aquitaine? The ruler of France&#39;s largest kingdom from the age of 15, Eleanor (1122- 1204) was renowned for beauty, intelligence, and the thoughtful application of power. Her marriage to her second husband, Henry Plantagenet of Normandy, brought her to the English throne; the birth of their sons John Lackland and Richard I Lionheart forever changed the face of medieval European history. Always at the center of her world, Eleanor remains a fascinating figure even today, and Amy Kelly captures the whirlwind of her life in this entrancing biography.This account of Queen Eleanor and her century is offered as a study of individuals who set their stamp upon the events of their time, rather than as a study of developing systems of politics, economics, or jurisprudence.</p><h2>Raising a Daughter After God&#39;s Own Heart</h2><p><p>Elizabeth George, popular speaker and bestselling author of <i>A Woman After God's Own Heart</i> and <i>A Young Woman After God's Own Heart</i>, provides an engaging and inspirational resource for every mom who wants to lead her daughter to a godly life by example, encouragement, study, and prayer.<br><br>With her biblical insight and child-raising experience, Elizabeth guides a mother's development of her daughter's spiritual life of faithfulness, obedience, and joy lived daily.

Uranium mines and mills on the Navajo Nation land have long supplied U.S. nuclear weapons and energy programs. By 1942, mines on the reservation were the main source of uranium for the top-secret Manhattan Project. Today, the Navajo Nation is home to more than a thousand abandoned uranium sites. Radiation-related diseases are endemic, claiming the health and lives of former miners and nonminers alike. </p><p>Traci Brynne Voyles argues that the presence of uranium mining on Din� (Navajo) land constitutes a clear case of environmental racism. Looking at discursive constructions of landscapes, she explores how environmental racism develops over time. For Voyles, the &#x201c;wasteland,&#x201d; where toxic materials are excavated, exploited, and dumped, is both a racial and a spatial signifier that renders an environment and the bodies that inhabit it pollutable. Because environmental inequality is inherent in the way industrialism operates, the wasteland is the &#x201c;other&#x201d; through which modern industrialism is established. </p><p>In examining the history of wastelanding in Navajo country, Voyles provides &#x201c;an environmental justice history&#x201d; of uranium mining, revealing how just as &#x201c;civilization&#x201d; has been defined on and through &#x201c;savagery,&#x201d; environmental privilege is produced by portraying other landscapes as marginal, worthless, and pollutable.<br></p></p><p><p>Traci Brynne Voyles is assistant professor of women&#x2019;s studies at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. </p><p>"<i>Wastelanding</i>&nbsp;is simply a brilliant book.&nbsp;It is at once a beautifully written, rigorously researched and hauntingly moving account of U.S. settler colonialism&#x2019;s violent making of racialized bodies and degraded landscapes in the U.S. Southwest. Traci Brynne Voyles draws together a rich set of critical approaches&nbsp;and weaves them into what will be the new bar for environmental politics."&#x2014;Jake Kosek, University of California, Berkeley</p><p>"This groundbreaking book examines how race, gender,&nbsp;and nature coproduce one another through &#x2018;wastelanding.&#x2019; Voyles&#x2019; masterful account explains how colonization, racialization, and resource extraction work together to produce sacrifice zones.

He was educated as a scholar of classical languages at Eton College and Cambridge University in England and later at Hebrew University, Israel. As a student, he was a philosopher and self-proclaimed agnostic. While in the British Medical Corps during World War II, Prince began to study the Bible as a philosophical work. Converted through a powerful encounter with Jesus Christ, he was baptized in the Holy Spirit a few days later. This life-changing experience altered the whole course of his life, which he thereafter devoted to studying and teaching the Bible as the Word of God.<br> Internationally recognized as a Bible scholar and spiritual patriarch, Derek Prince taught and ministered on six continents for more than sixty years. Until a few years before his death at the age of 88, he traveled the world, imparting God&#x2019;s revealed truth, praying for the sick and afflicted, and sharing his prophetic insights into world events in the light of Scripture. He is the author of over eighty books, six hundred audio teachings, and one hundred video teachings, many of which have been translated and published in more than one hundred languages. He pioneered teaching on such groundbreaking themes as generational curses, the biblical significance of Israel, and demonology.<br> Derek Prince Ministries, with its international headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, continues to distribute his teachings and to train missionaries, church leaders, and congregations through its worldwide national offices. It is estimated that Derek Prince&#x2019;s messages have reached more than half the globe through his books, CDs, and daily radio program, which is now known as<i> Derek Prince Legacy Radio</i>.

A teenage girl has gone missing. Everyone is called upon to join the search. The villagers fan out across the moors as the police set up roadblocks and a crowd of news reporters descends on what is usually a place of peace.

It was cold and there was little conversation. There were questions that weren&#39;t being asked. The missing girl&#39;s name was Rebecca Shaw. When last seen she&#39;d been wearing a white hooded top. A mist hung low across the moor and the ground was frozen hard. They were given instructions and then they moved off, their boots crunching on the stiff ened ground and their tracks fading behind them as the heather sprang back into shape. She was five feet tall, with dark-blonde hair. She had been missing for hours. They kept their eyes down and they didn&#39;t speak and they wondered what they might fi nd. The only sounds were footsteps and dogs barking along the road and faintly a helicopter from the reservoirs. The helicopter had been out all night and found nothing, its searchlight skimming across the heather and surging brown streams. Jackson&#39;s sheep had taken the fear and scattered through a broken gate, and he&#39;d been up all hours bringing them back. The mountain-rescue teams and the cave teams and the police had found nothing, and at midnight a search had been called. It hadn&#39;t taken much to raise the volunteers. Half the village was out already, talking about what could have happened.</p><h2>STATUS ANXIETY</h2><p>We all worry about what others think of us. We all long to succeed and fear failure. We all suffer to a greater or lesser degree, usually privately and with embarrassment from status anxiety. For the first time, Alain de Botton gives a name to this universal condition and sets out to investigate both its origins and possible solutions. He looks at history, philosophy, economics, art and politics and reveals the many ingenious ways that great minds have overcome their worries. The result is a book that is not only entertaining and thought-provoking but genuinely wise and helpful as well.</p><p>&#x201c;Every adult life could be said to be defined by two great love stories.

And yet this second love story is no less intense than the first.&#x201d;<br><br>This is a book about an almost universal anxiety that rarely gets mentioned directly: an anxiety about what others think of us, about whether we&#x2019;re judged a success or a failure, a winner or a loser.

With the help of philosophers, artists and writers, he examines the origins of status anxiety (ranging from the consequences of the French Revolution to our secret dismay at the success of our friends) before revealing ingenious ways in which people have been able to overcome their worries in the search for happiness. We learn about sandal-less philosophers and topless bohemians, about the benefits of putting skulls on our sideboards, and about looking at ancient ruins.<br> <br>The result is a book that isn&#x2019;t just highly entertaining and thought-provoking, but that is genuinely wise and helpful, too.Alain de Botton is the author of Essays in Love, The Romantic Movement, Kiss and Tell, How Proust Can Change Your Life, The Consolations of Philosophy, The Art of Travel, Status Anxiety, The Architecture of Happiness, The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work, A Week at the Airport, Religion for Atheists, The News: A User&#39;s Manual, and latest novel The Course of Love, among many others.

Taking an interdisciplinary approach, Crossan shines new light on the theological and cultural contexts from which the Christian church arose. He argues powerfully that Christianity would have happened with or without Paul and contends that Jesus&#39; &#34;resurrection&#34; meant something vastly different for his early followers than it does for many traditional Christians today-what mattered was Christina origins finally illuminates the mysterious period that set Western religious history in its decisive course.</p><p>John Dominic Crossan is the leading contemporary scholar on the historical Jesus, which means that his vocation is to look behind, around, and through Christ's resurrection, toward the goal of establishing what can be known about the life of Jesus of Nazareth. <p> His search for the historical Jesus, however, takes place in the larger context of the life of the church. Among the goals of <i>The Birth of Christianity</i> is to teach readers how our habits of worship have created false gods. To that end, Crossan attempts to unearth the religion's earliest forms. What did Christianity look like, Crossan asks, between the crucifixion and the conversion of Paul? And what might Christianity look like today had Saul never set off toward Damascus? </p><p> Crossan's conclusions don't come from newly discovered documents; they come from freshly-minted academic methodologies. He uses anthropology, history, and archaeology to construct his arguments about the essential nature of both Jesus' religion and Paul's. The 25-cent summary of his conclusion is that Jesus did not recognize the dualism between spirit and flesh that formed the basis of Paul's apocalyptic Christianity. In other words, Jesus was more Jewish than Paul. </p><p> The ramifications of this argument are huge. Crossan says much of Christian worship--and many of the world's injustices--are based on the dualistic Christ that Paul preached. Though Crossan doesn't bully readers into accepting his conclusions, he does press hard for them to situate their own beliefs in relation to his interpretations of Jesus and Paul. At every point in the evolution of his argument, he asks readers questions such as "How do you understand a human being?" and "What is the character of your God?" Then he proceeds to answer these questions himself. Finally, he tells readers what he thinks these answers mean. </p><p> It's an incredibly civilized style of argument--both spiritually and intellectually respectful and always rhetorically engaging. Though <i>The Birth of Christianity</i> weighs in at almost 600 pages of text, you'll probably want to read every word. And after that, you'll probably be hungry for more.</p>"This book is about the lost years of earliest Christianity, about the 30s and 40s of the first century, about those dark decades immediately after the execution of Jesus.... The obscurity of the 30s and 40s can be emphasized by the comparative brilliancy of the 50s. From that later decade we have the letters of Paul.... From them, above all else, we receive the temptation to gloss speedily over the 30s or 40s and move swiftly to those better-documented 50s.... Before there was Paul the apostle in the early 50s, there was Paul the persecutor in the early 30s. What was there for him to persecute?" (from <i>The Birth of Christianity</i> <p>In this long-awaited companion to his landmark <i>The Historical Jesus,</i> John Dominic Crossan, the world's foremost expert on the historical Jesus, explores the lost years of earliest Christianity, those immediately following the execution of Jesus. He establishes the contextual setting by an interdisciplinary combination of anthropological, historical, and archaeological approaches. He identifies the textual sources by a literary analysis of the earliest discernible layers within our present gospels, both inside and outside the New Testament. Context and text come together to challenge long-standing assumptions about the role of Paul and the meaning of resurrection, and to forge an eloquent and powerful new understanding of the birth of the Christian church. </p><p>John Dominic Crossan, one of the most influential figures in biblical scholarship, combines innovative scholarship with compelling insight in illuminating the mysteries of the origins of Christianity. Crossan's meticulous research into the anthropological milieu within which Christianity arose, and his study of the emergence of early Christian communities, form the basis for his stunning and original theory. Separating history from theology and redaction, he presents a vivid account of early Christianity's interaction with the world around it, and of the new traditions and communities established as Jesus' companions continued their movement after his death. </p><p>With ancient traditional Judaism under increasing pressure from both Roman commercial exploitation and Greek cultural domination, the Kingdom-of-God movement of Jesus and his followers establish radical but non-violent resistance in the Lower Galilee of the late 20s. As early Jewish and Greek-influenced schools of thought present competing visions of the nature of the spirit and the flesh, it is the message brought by Jesus during his life that creates the spiritual center of the early church. </p><p>The Resurrection, while essential to the story of Christ as told through the centuries, is understood in a different light when presented in the setting of a Mediterranean culture in which events such as apparitions by the dead and ecstatic visions were far from unusual. While the eschatological teachings of Paul play a large role in the growth and development of the church, they are seen to follow, rather than define, the moment of its birth. </p><p>Ground-breaking and brilliantly crafted, <i>The Birth of Christianity</i> is an indispensable addition to our understanding of the origins of the Christian faith.</p></p><h2>The Little Disturbances of Man (Contemporary American Fiction)</h2><p>Whether writing about relationships, sexy little girls, loving and bickering couples, angry suburbanites, frustrated job-seekers, or Jewish children performing a Christmas play, Grace Paley captures the loneliness, poignancy, and humor of the human experience with matchless style in this book of short stories. <br><br> "Fresh and vigorous...Mrs. Paley&#x2019;s view of life is her own."--<i>The New Yorker<br></i><br> "The glad tidings from this reviewer&#x2019;s corner are of the appearance of a [writer] possessed of an all-too-infrequent literary virtue--the comic vision."--<i>The New York Times</i></p><p><b>Grace Paley</b>&nbsp;was a short story&nbsp;writer,&nbsp;poet, pacifist, political activist, and professor.

It is so flat and uninteresting. Will Brussels be more exciting? I have dreamed about it all through the dreary winter at school. Is it as magical a place as they say?" Miss Jennifer Simpson sat with her nose almost touching the glass of the carriage in which she traveled with her stepmother. She was clearly not intent on waiting for answers to her questions. She had asked the same ones a dozen times since they had left Antwerp.<br><br>"It is just an ordinary city," Ellen Simpson said, "made extraordinary by the presence of so many allied troops at present and so many different uniforms. We will be there soon enough. You will feel better once you have seen your papa again. I know he can scarce wait to see you."<br><br>"Oh," Jennifer said, withdrawing her gaze for a moment from the passing scenery, "I still cannot quite believe that I am finished with school forever and ever, Ellen. I am eighteen years old, and this time I will stay with you and Papa, not be packed off back to school almost before I have started to enjoy myself."Ellen smiled. "I know your papa is rather concerned about bringing you here," she said. "It was really too bad that Bonaparte was allowed to escape from Elba and that the King of France has fled to Ghent. I had hoped that the wars were over. But it appears that they are not. You may not be here for long after all, Jennifer. But I know your papa wanted you with him for a while."<br><br>"Oh, but the Duke of Wellington is here now," Jennifer said. "You told me so, and Helen West's sister wrote her that all would be safe once the duke arrived. And she also wrote that there are so many entertainments in Brussels that it is sometimes hard to choose among them. That is true, is it not, Ellen? And you helped me buy all those gorgeous clothes. And the city is full of officers and scarlet uniforms. It is a pity that Papa's uniform is green. It is not near as dashing as the Guards' uniforms."<br><br>"I am quite sure you will be here quite long enough to enjoy yourself," Ellen said. "I hope so. I know your papa wants to spend some time with you before he has to go into battle again."<br><br>"I suppose he thinks he might die," the girl said indignantly. "He should not be so gloomy. Papa has always come through safely."<br><br>"But there is always a grave danger that he might not," Ellen said quietly. "You do not know, Jennifer. Your papa always kept you away from the army, which was as well. You were never in Spain and did not see the battlefields after battles." She shuddered. "If you had seen, you would have marveled that anyone survived at all. Your papa has lived through so many battles. It does not seem fair that he must face yet another."<br><br>"I forgot." Jennifer laid a hand on her stepmother's arm, her pretty face contrite. "Your own papa was killed in one of those battles. And you were there with him. It must have been dreadful."<br><br>"Yes." Ellen patted the girl's hand. "It was. But at least he was killed instantly. That is a blessing one learns to be thankful for when one has lived close to battle."<br><br>Jennifer squeezed her stepmother's arm before removing her hand. "And you and Papa married," she said. "He is fond of you, is he not? I used to be jealous for a while. I think I even hated you until I met you. Do you think I will find a husband here, Ellen? Am I pretty enough, do you think?"<br><br>Ellen smiled into the anxious face turned to her own. "You know you are," she said. "But I would not be in too much of a hurry to fix your choice if I were you, Jennifer. Not with the times so uncertain. There is no point in inviting heartache."<br><br>They lapsed into silence while Jennifer gazed with renewed eagerness and impatience from the window. Indeed, the girl was very pretty, Ellen thought. She was small and shapely, with masses of shining dark ringlets peeping from beneath her bonnet, and an eager, dark-eyed, rosy-cheeked face. She would doubtless be a great favorite with the officers who thronged the drawing rooms and ballrooms of Brussels. And she would have all the entertainments and activities she dreamed of. Even before Ellen had left for England three weeks before, there had been an almost desperate gaiety about social life in Brussels. There was a great battle looming. She could feel it in her bones.<br><br>And though she looked with amused indulgence at the openly impatient girl turned to the window beside her, she found herself too looking eagerly from the window, trying to recognize landmarks, hoping to see one that would indicate they were close to Brussels at last. Close to home.<br><br>Not that Brussels was home, of course. But then, nowhere else was home either. She had not had a static home for ten years. Home was Charlie. And Charlie was in Brussels. She would see him soon. Three weeks she had been away from him. An eternity! She had never been away from him for so long, not since their marriage five years before. She felt tears prick at her eyelids as she gazed from the window.<br><br>Charlie was fifteen years her senior, forty to her five-and-twenty years. He was not at all the sort of man she would have expected to love, but she did love him with a fierceness that was almost a pain. He looked perhaps even older than his years. He was balding and portly, though not with soft living. He had been a soldier since he was sixteen, and had been hardened by rough living conditions, especially the almost indescribably harsh conditions of life in Spain during the Peninsular wars.<br><br>She had met him in Spain when she had gone there with her father, and he had always been kind to her. She had been fifteen years old at the time, and she had been bewildered, distraught over the events that had taken her there with a father who was a stranger to her, and unable for a long time to adjust to life lived in the tail of a vast army.<br><br>When her father had been killed in battle, Charlie had been the one to break the news to her, the one to comfort her, though by that time she had made a wide circle of friends. And they had married soon after. Perhaps it had seemed to some that it was a marriage of convenience on her part. And perhaps it was in a way. She certainly had not seemed to have anywhere else to go. But she had loved him even then, and her love had grown daily since. There was not a kinder man in the world than Charlie Simpson.<br><br>He treated her always as if she were a precious and treasured possession.Ellen closed her eyes. She would not get there sooner by willing the miles to pass. Soon now she would see him again. She would feel his arms around her again. She would be safe again.<br><br>And once more she would begin the wait for yet another battle. Another battle that might take him away from her forever. They had talked of a home in the country in England when Napoleon had been finally defeated and exiled to the island of Elba. She might finally have had a life free of anxiety. It did not seem fair. Oh, it was <i>not</i> fair!<br><br>But for all that, life lived with an army was something that somehow got into one's blood. Charlie had not wanted her to come to Brussels with him. He had wanted her to stay in England. But how could she have done that? She would have been away from the only person in the world who really mattered to her. And she would have been away from her friends--Charlie's friends, and a few of their wives.<br><br>She liked to bring some of the comforts of home to those men who did not have wives. She was particularly fond of Lord Eden--Lieutenant Lord Eden--her husband's closest friend, and as different from him as night is from day. Lord Eden was her age; he was a baron, the younger brother of the Earl of Amberley; he was very handsome. He was tall, broad-shouldered, well-muscled, agile; and he had fair, wavy hair, distinctive green eyes, and a laughing, handsome face. He was wealthy, well-educated, and charming. So different from Charlie, whose father was titled, it was true--he was Sir Jasper Simpson--but who had been estranged from his family nineteen years before and had known nothing in his life beyond the army.<br><br>Lord Eden had spent a great deal of his time with them since his arrival in Spain three years before. Many was the time he had sat in their tent or in their rooms, talking with Charlie, often about army matters that were of no great interest to her, while she quietly sewed or made them tea. She had always enjoyed those times.<br><br>She looked forward to seeing all her friends again. She looked forward to seeing Lord Eden and to entertaining him again, just as she and Charlie had always done. And perhaps--who knew?--he would take a fancy to Jennifer.<br><br>She could hardly wait.<br><br>Would they never be home?<br><br>Had Charlie missed her as much as she had missed him?<br><br>"Will we be there soon?" Jennifer asked, turning from the window, a frown of impatience between her brows.<br><br>"Not long now," Ellen said with a smile. "Oh, Jennifer, I can scarce sit still here. I am so longing to see your papa again."<br><br>CAPTAIN CHARLES SIMPSON was on his way home through the park in Brussels with his friend Lieutenant Lord Eden after a tiring day of work."<br><br>They do have a distinct advantage over us poor riflemen, don't they?" Captain Simpson said, nodding in the direction of a cluster of scarlet-coated officers gathered around two young ladies who were feeding the swans on the lake. "Why did you choose the green, Eden? You have the rank and wealth. Why did you not choose one of the more glamorous cavalry regiments?"<br><br>Lord Eden smiled. "I did not join the army for the glamour of it," he said. "I joined because I had to, Charlie. I would sooner not have done so, you know. I fair broke my mother's heart, and my twin sister threw every cushion in the house at me when I broke the news to her, and refused to speak to me for a whole day afterward. But I had to join. And finally, at the advanced age of two-and-twenty, I did. I wanted to fight where the main action always is. With the infantry."<br><br>"Well," the captain said with a hearty laugh as one of the young ladies caught sight of Lord Eden and looked a second time, blushing, "it is doubtless just as well you are in green rather than scarlet, lad, or you would be so busy fighting duels with all the other young officers that you would have no time for old Boney. You're a handsome devil, and no denying the fact. You will stop in for tea?"<br><br>"I am quite sure it would not be at all the thing," Lord Eden said. "If Mrs. Simpson has arrived with your daughter, none of you will want the added presence of a stranger. Some other time, Charlie."<br><br>"A stranger!" Captain Simpson looked quite offended for a moment. "You? Ellen will scold me all evening if I fail to bring you with me. Besides, I want to show off my Jennifer. A fetching little thing, Eden, even if I do say so myself. You would not think to look at me, would you, that I have a pretty little thing for a daughter?" He roared with laughter, turning not a few heads in their direction. "She favors her mother, fortunately for her."<br><br>"I will look in for a few minutes, then," his friend said. "But only for a few minutes if they have arrived, mind. They will be tired from the journey. If they haven't come yet, I'll share some brandy with you, Charlie, and put my feet up for a while. You have been like a coiled spring all day."<br><br>"One thing is for sure," the captain said. "I'm not letting Ellen go away from me again. We haven't been apart in five years, you know, since our marriage. You get used to having a woman around. You should try it sometime, Eden."His friend grinned. "I would have to be awfully fond of her," he said. "I have a habit of falling out of love as fast as I fall in. You are fortunate in Mrs. Simpson, Charlie. A nice quiet, loyal wife."<br><br>The captain laughed again. "Your tone of voice says that you would be bored silly with such a wife in a fortnight, Eden," he said. "You wait, my boy. You will fall in love to stay one of these days. And you couldn't do better than someone like Ellen. She's a treasure. Here we are."<br><br>He had stopped outside the house on the Rue de la Montagne where he was billeted. And his beaming face grew even brighter after he had climbed the stairs to his rooms to discover that his wife and daughter were indeed home before him. Though only just. Both still wore traveling dress, and one trunk with a hat box perched precariously on top still stood in the middle of the living room. His wife's maid whisked the latter into a bedchamber as his daughter came rushing across the room shrieking and hurled herself into his arms.<br><br>"Papa!" she cried. "Oh, Papa. I thought the journey would take forever. And I was dreadfully sick on the boat. And Ellen says that there is bound to be a great battle soon, but it is not so, is it? Not now that the duke is here. Oh, Papa, I am so happy to be free of school at last. You cannot imagine!"<br><br>Her father held her at arm's length and chuckled. "Hello, puss," he said. "You are looking as fine as fivepence. Can this really be my little girl all grown up so soon? Welcome home, sweetheart." He hugged her to him.<br><br>Ellen curtsied to Lord Eden and held out a hand to him. He took it in both of his and raised it to his lips.<br><br>"I am pleased to see you safe at home, ma'am," he said, smiling warmly down at her. "Charlie has been like a fish out of water, and it has not been the same here in your rooms without you. Have you had a tedious journey? You look tired."<br><br>"I am a little," she said. "But only because I could not wait to be home. It is so good to be back again." She withdrew her hand after he had squeezed it between both his own.<br><br>And he watched as she turned from him, and as Charlie turned from his daughter. And he felt as he felt frequently in the presence of these two friends--an amused sort of affection as it became obvious that if he fell through a hole in the ground and disappeared forever, they would not even notice.<br><br>"Ellen," Charlie said, opening up his arms to her, "you are home."<br><br>"Yes, Charlie," she said. "At last."She did hesitate a moment, feeling the presence of the other two, but the pull of those extended arms was obviously too strong for her. She went into them and hid her face against her husband's shoulder as he hugged her close and rocked her.</p><h2>A Brief History of Misogyny: The World&#39;s Oldest Prejudice (Brief Histories)</h2><p><p>In this compelling, powerful book, highly respected writer and commentator Jack Holland sets out to answer a daunting question: how do you explain the oppression and brutalization of half the world's population by the other half, throughout history? </p><br><p>The result takes the reader on an eye-opening journey through centuries, continents and civilizations as it looks at both historical and contemporary attitudes to women. Encompassing the Church, witch hunts, sexual theory, Nazism and pro-life campaigners, we arrive at today's developing world, where women are increasingly and disproportionately at risk because of radicalised religious belief, famine, war and disease. Well-informed and researched, highly readable and thought-provoking, this is no outmoded feminist polemic: it's a refreshingly straightforward investigation into an ancient, pervasive and enduring injustice. It deals with the fundamentals of human existence -- sex, love, violence -- that have shaped the lives of humans throughout history. </p><br><p>The answer? It's time to recognize that the treatment of women amounts to nothing less than an abuse of human rights on an unthinkable scale. A Brief History of Misogyny is an important and timely book that will make a long-lasting contribution to the efforts to improve those rights throughout the world.</p></p><p>Jack Holland was a highly respected author and journalist known particularly for his commentary about Northern Irish politics. He grew up in Belfast (where he was taught by Seamus Heaney) and worked with Jeremy Paxman and other outstanding journalists at BBC Belfast during a period of seminal current affairs programming. Jack published four novels and seven works of non-fiction, most of the latter having to do with politics and terrorism in Northern Ireland, including the bestselling Phoenix. Sadly, Jack died of cancer in 2004, just after the manuscript of Misogyny had been delivered and accepted by his US publisher. On his death, his family received letters of respect from statesmen including Ted Kennedy and Hilary Clinton, who had come to rely on his balanced analysis of Irish politic.</p><h2>Death in the A Shau Valley: L Company LRRPs in Vietnam, 1969-1970</h2><p><i>&#x201c;The enemy had a single purpose: kill me and my teammates.&#x201d;</i><br><br>Larry Chambers was still new to Vietnam in early 1969 when the LRRPs of the 101st Airborne Division became L Company, 75th (Rangers). But his unit&#x2019;s mission stayed the same: act as the eyes and ears of the 101st deep in the dreaded A Shau Valley&#x2014;where the NVA ruled.<br><br>Relentless thick fog frequently made fighter bombers useless in the A Shau, and the enemy had furnished the nearby mountaintops with antiaircraft machine guns to protect the massive trail network that snaked through it. So, outgunned, outmanned, and unsupported, the teams of L Company executed hundreds of courageous missions. Now, in this powerful personal record, Larry Chambers recaptures the experience of the war&#x2019;s most brutal on-the-job training, where the slightest noise or smallest error could bring sudden&#x2014;and certain&#x2014;death. . . .</p><p><b>Larry Chambers</b>&nbsp;spent fifteen months in Vietnam with the 101st Airborne as a LRP/Ranger. Among other awards and decorations, Chambers earned two Bronze Stars for valor, a Purple Heart, two Air Medals for valor, the Combat Infantryman&#x2019;s Badge, the Army Commendation Medal, and the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry. He was with L Co., 75th Infantry (Ranger), and F Co., 58th (LRP), in Vietnam.<br><br> After returning home he earned a bachelor&#x2019;s degree and a master&#x2019;s degree from the University of Utah and graduated as a member of the Phi Kappa Phi honor society. Chambers lives in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. He is also the author of&nbsp;<i>Recondo: LRRPs in the 101st Airborne</i>.Commo Check<br> &nbsp;<br> On a ridgetop just east of an abandoned 101st firebase, South Vietnam, May 10, 1970<br> &nbsp;<br> The six men of the Ranger team had gone about their normal duties, made the required radio checks, secured their perimeter, formed a night defensive position (NDP), and laid out four claymore mines. They sat around before it was too dark to see, slapped at mosquitoes, and, in whispers, shot the bull about what they were going to do back in the World. They made their communications check at 0430 hours the following morning&#x2014;negative. The team leader said he was going to move to a new location at first light.<br> &nbsp;<br> Camp Eagle, May 20, 1969<br> &nbsp;<br> My last recon mission was on Larry Closson&#x2019;s team. The team consisted of Closson, Mother Rucker, Marvin Hillman, Ricky &#x201c;New Guy&#x201d; Lawhon, and Doc Glasser. I had already been on four missions with Closson, including the one that nearly fried our butts.<br> &nbsp;<br> The morning before that mission, we all sat in the 17th Cav mess hall telling stories and eating the usual breakfast of creamed chipped beef on toast, commonly known as shit on a shingle (or just SOS). Between lies, we updated each other with news from Stateside.<br> &nbsp;<br> I remember standing in the chow line and flicking George Thomas&#x2019;s toast off his plate. <br> &nbsp;<br> It landed on the ground, and Dixie, our mascot dog, grabbed it, then ducked under the table. Thomas, who was as country as a turnip green, retaliated by pouring a pile of salt all over my beef&#x2014;which didn&#x2019;t change the taste one bit.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sgt. Larry Closson told us to get a leg on. Closson weighed over two hundred pounds, looked like he could lift a house, but wouldn&#x2019;t hurt a fly&#x2014;at least not one on our side. He was a gentle, white-haired giant. Closson was what we called a &#x201c;shake &#x2019;n&#x2019; bake sergeant,&#x201d; meaning he had gone to an advanced version of AIT (advanced infantry training) and made sergeant before he shipped to Nam. Everyone resented the idea of making rank in ninety days, so the shake &#x2019;n&#x2019; bake name tagged those guys.<br> &nbsp;<br> Despite the fact that he was now a known lightning hazard, Mother Rucker was still the radioman on the team. Rucker couldn&#x2019;t carry an M-16 or a CAR-15 (a slightly shorter version of the M-16) like the rest of us. No, Mother always had to be different; so he carried a 9mm Swedish-K submachine gun that he had gotten in trade from some Special Forces guy over at FOB-1. Rucker also wore his hair longer than regulation, and from a side view, he had a slight resemblance to General Custer. He was &#x201c;short,&#x201d; with less than two weeks left to serve in Vietnam.<br> &nbsp;<br> I figured it would be fairly safe to go back out with Rucker and Closson since, according to the weather brief, neither of them would be making any unnecessary phone calls in a lightning storm.<br> &nbsp;<br> Marvin Hillman was a shy, handsome, quiet black kid who made you feel welcome whenever he was around. He was about my height, five feet ten, and weighed 160 pounds&#x2014;ten pounds less than I did at the time.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ricky New Guy and Doc Glasser were two of my favorite guys to tease. Ricky New Guy had been on &#x201c;umpteen&#x201d; missions and had been in country for seven months, but we still called him New Guy. The name just stuck with him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Doc Glasser was &#x201c;a reject&#x201d; from the Special Forces medical training and proud of it. He loved to remind us of that. It seems he got a little too drunk back at Fort Bragg, punched out a lifer, and ended up a PFC with orders for Vietnam, later finding his way into the Rangers. The nice thing about Special Forces was that they trained their recruits well. Even their rejects were a cut above. And with Doc, we had our own medic on the team.<br> &nbsp;<br> I, on the other hand, had entered the service because I was fulfilling a lifelong dream&#x2014;not mine, but my father&#x2019;s&#x2014;to be in combat the way every male in my family had been before me.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lt. Jim Jackson was in charge of the briefing that morning. Jackson wore a freshly pressed uniform and looked out of place as he walked in and moved to the front of the room with our CO, Captain Cardona, at his side. &#x201c;Ten-Hut!&#x201d; Closson shouted, protocol for a senior officer entering a room. But before anyone could stand, Captain Cardona answered back, &#x201c;At ease.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jackson talked in a slow, methodical drawl. He went over the weather report, which always seemed to be exactly the same. &#x201c;The weather for the next six days will be hot and humid, with afternoon rain. Your AO (area of operation) will be foggy in the morning, cloudy during the day, with some rain in the afternoon and night. Winds will be out of the southwest.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I tried to remain attentive but was nearly asleep. Jackson walked to the side of a long table where a stack of SOI (signal operation instructions) booklets lay, containing all radio frequencies and call signs. The word CONFIDENTIAL was stamped on the outside of the booklets in red, large block letters. Inside, code words were neatly typed, and coordinates were drawn on a grid, so we could communicate by radio without giving away our positions. Jackson handed the booklets to the team leaders.<br> &nbsp;<br> George Thompson asked, &#x201c;When do I get a book?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get yours when we attack Guam,&#x201d; I volunteered.<br> &nbsp;<br> George looked at me, puzzled. &#x201c;Guam?&#x201d; The room cracked up. Then George grabbed me by the neck and almost strangled me. I loved to tease him, but I always had to pay a price for it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cardona gave the warning order. &#x201c;Heavy enemy activity has been reported in the southeastern sector of your AO.&#x201d; He pointed at the map. &#x201c;The A Shau Valley. You&#x2019;re familiar with the area. You are to conduct a BDA (bomb damage assessment).&#x201d; With as little enthusiasm, he concluded, &#x201c;We had an Arc Light (B-52 strike) in the valley three days ago. We have intelligence that an NVA regiment has a base camp in one of your AOs; we need to find out if we nailed it. Be at the chopper at 0530. Thank you, gentlemen.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> This is great, I thought, a bomb damage assessment. We land in a freshly devastated AO to examine what&#x2019;s left after a B-52 bombardment. All I could think about was the possibility of enemy survivors; those guys might be a little pissed.<br> &#x2014;<br> At 0530 the next day, puddles of water dotted the acid pad (helicopter landing pad). I mixed some camouflage with some insect repellent, to soften it, and covered the back of my neck and the shiny parts of my ears.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then I watched Rucker add last-minute touches to his camouflage. He was extraordinary at this activity; in fact, he was the best. Rucker would really take his time contouring his face, and when he was done, his black and green tiger fatigues matched his skin. He looked exactly like a jungle leaf.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was not as good at the special effects. The upper part of my face got a fast crisscross of dark green paint, which, now that I think about it, probably resembled a rifle target. My eyebrows looked like bat wings about to take off from the bridge of my nose. Even though Hillman was black, he still had to camouflage his face. When he was painted, he looked like an evil circus clown.<br> &nbsp;<br> The whole idea was to break up the surface of the face, which really stood out in the jungle. But I knew, even as I amused myself with the exercise, that if any enemy soldiers got close enough to see us, we&#x2019;d scare the shit out of them.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was always something soothing about those last minutes of activity. I didn&#x2019;t think too much about the mission and what might be waiting for us. The rest of the team checked packs and smoked cigarettes. I was trying not to joke around this time and to just concentrate on the job at hand, but Ricky New Guy and Doc Glasser took one look at me and both started laughing.<br> &nbsp;<br> I shook off the insult and pulled back the charging handle on my CAR-15, inserting a live round in the chamber, then rechecked my safety to make sure it was on. The CAR-15 fired a 5.56mm (.223 caliber, for those of you with a love of varmint guns) round. With most of the older weapons we had, the previous owners had filed down the trigger spring for the safety catch so we could slip from safe to auto without the metallic click that might otherwise tip off potential NVA casualties&#x2014;perfect for walking point.<br> &nbsp;<br> I always carried a sling on my rifle so it fit snugly around my shoulder. That way I could hold my CAR-15 in one hand, keeping it pointed straight ahead, and leaving my other hand free to clear the vegetation. My first three rounds were always tracers, so I could follow the tracers right into my target. My last three rounds were also tracers so I&#x2019;d know when I was coming to the end of a magazine. Then I&#x2019;d be ready to click in the next one. I loved that CAR-15. It just looked cool, and when it didn&#x2019;t jam, it was a great rifle. I wiped it down with my rag and set it down.<br> &nbsp;<br> Closson handed me a starlight scope and a claymore mine. &#x201c;Here. Stick these in your pack.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Stella (The Puppy Place #36)</h2><p><b>Welcome to the Puppy Place--where every puppy finds a home!</b><br><br>Charles and Lizzie Peterson love puppies.

Tibbetts, </b>currently a Professor at California State University, San Bernardino,&nbsp;has been pursuing an understanding of criminal offending for over the past two decades. He has attempted to discover the extent to which individuals&#x2019; inherent dispositions and attitudinal traits contribute to their offending decisions, especially in relation to other factors, such as demographic, developmental, and situational factors. Dr. Tibbetts&#x2019; research has included work on the differences between men and women in their decisions to commit deviant behavior, as well as their perceptions of risk and consequences of getting caught. His additional research interests include the effects of perinatal disorders as an influence in future criminality, the etiology of white-collar crime, and gang intervention.&nbsp; Dr. Tibbetts has published nine books and more than 50 scholarly papers examining various issues in criminology. He received the 2011 Outstanding Professor Award at CSU, San Bernardino. He previously worked extensively as an Officer of the Court in providing recommendations for dispositions of numerous juvenile court cases from 1997 to 2008. </p><p>"Arguably, the complete package.

This series of materials, Spanish at Work, is designed to allow colleges to create and deliver pragmatic, "real-world" language and culture training programs so that students can master "need-to-know" language. It is designed for students without previous Spanish study, at the beginning (not intermediate) level, but it also works well to reinforce background knowledge already in place. Spanish for Business is the second of this series, following Spanish for Health Care. Students, whether professionals already working in the field or career/goal-oriented students in an occupational training program, are presented key vocabulary in a comprehensible-input format, focusing on easily mastered core expressions. Art, realia, photographs, and brief dialogues reinforce needed terms, supported by brief grammar explanations. In class, students will practice communicative survival using key vocabulary essential to each context to enable them to utilize their Spanish in the real world at work. Highlights of the Program </p><p> Spanish for Business has ten chapters plus a brief preliminary lesson and two review chapters. Each lesson has two modules, each with a vocabulary segment and a grammar segment using the context-appropriate vocabulary. The lessons end with the vocabulary list and synthesis activities combining listening, speaking, reading, and writing. All exercises move from mechanical to production-oriented, following the logical progression of language acquisition. The final section, Algo m�s, features a culturally informative reading and sends the student out to the real world to look for material tied to the theme of the chapter. Organization of the Text </p><p> <br>* Vocabulary presentation: Each of the two modules presents key vocabulary by means of art, realia, photographs, and brief dialogues. The inclusion of two separate spreads in each module allows for manageable amounts of easily mastered core expressions pertinent to each occupational area. <br>* Grammar approach: Grammar practice is embedded automatically in context, not called out as mastery exercises. In class, students will focus on communicative survival using basic vocabulary essential to the topic to enable them to utilize their Spanish in the real world of their job environment. Brief grammar explanations, two per module, are presented in "chunks." <br>* Vocabulary summary: Each module's vocabulary is listed by function&#x2014;nouns, verbs, adjectives, and other expressions. The glossary at the end of the book lists the lesson in which the item was introduced, intended as a convenient reference, especially for preview/review. <br>* S�ntesis: Skills and topics are interwoven at the end of each chapter into a series of skill-building and skill-chaining activities that bring together the chapter vocabulary, structures, and cultural content. In recognition of the increased interest in Applied Spanish courses across the country, each of the ten regular lessons concludes with a task-based module in which students use Spanish in a realistic, applied way. Modules focus on a variety of fields where students may be likely to seek their future or current careers. Art, articles, and other documents emphasize the usefulness and vitality of Spanish in today's world. </p><p> <br>* A escuchar develops students' ability to understand spoken Spanish in a variety of authentic contexts. <br>* A conversav includes open-ended speaking activities based on naturally occurring discourse situations. Students learn to express and discuss their own needs and interests. <br>* A leer introduces basic readings for students to become independent readers, able to understand the general meaning of a text as well as to extricate specific information from it. <br>* A escribir provides activities in which students learn to compose messages and memos, paragraphs and publicity announcements. <br> <br>* Algo m�s: This section focuses on contemporary cultural issues related to the chapter theme. The Ventana cultural reading exposes the student to key information. A broad variety of contemporary topics is featured, appropriate to the lesson's context. A buscar, immediately following, then guides students to gather information to enhance their own connection to this topic. A conocer introduces students to prominent Hispanics succeeding in the occupational field. <br> Components </p><p> <br>* Text <br>* Workbook <br>* Audio CD with available tapescript, including listening segments, dialogues, and vocabulary lists <br>* Instructor's Resource Manual, including tests <br>* Interactive, text-specific Web site, including tests and links <br> For the student </p><p> Welcome!

There is the main text, of course, the file that the author proudly submits to their publisher. But around this, hemming it in on the page or enclosing it at the front and back of the book, there are dozens of other texts--page numbers and running heads, copyright statements and errata lists--each possessed of particular conventions, each with their own lively histories. To consider these paratexts--recalling them from the margins, letting them take centre stage--is to be reminded that no book is the sole work of the author whose name appears on the cover; rather, every book is the sum of a series of collaborations. It is to be reminded, also, that not everything is intended for us, the readers.

WICCA: THE COMPLETE CRAFT offers a comprehensive overview of Wiccan philosophy, dispels the common misconceptions, and is a useful primer for practicing Wicca as a spiritual lifestyle. Included are chapters on sacred space, ritual tools, holy days, meditations and visualizations, spells and the art of spell casting, as well as terminology.</p><p>It's hard to imagine a more comprehensive or well-written resource for students of Wicca than <i>Wicca: The Complete Craft</i>. D.J. Conway, whose earlier books include <i>Moon Magick</i> and <i>The Celtic Dragon Tarot</i>, speaks about the Wicca religion with seasoned authority, making this one of the best guidebooks on the market. She begins with an overview of Wicca, explaining its historical roots and dispelling common assumptions. For example, the practice of magic is not the focus of Wiccan religion, just a sideline, she notes. Conway also possesses a strong voice of integrity. Unlike some fad-feeding authors, she discourages teens from becoming involved in Wiccan magic without the explicit approval of their parents. In fact, even advises teens to avoid the practice of magic altogether, since "the vast majority of teenagers lack the life experience or emotional maturity to deal correctly with the ethics involved with magic." This sort of ethical vigilance is carried throughout the book. Conway offers over 500 pages worth of lessons and rituals, including the making of a witch (expect to study at least a year and a day), developing psychic abilities, protection and self-defense, puberty rites, breaking spells, astral projection, magical herbs, and ritual tools. This is <i>the</i> book for beginners, and is certainly a respectable resource for more mature witches. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>D. J.

The God of the universe has spoken to us; his every word is profound. We need to learn from this God. As this book takes us through God&#39;s commands to sacrifice we slowly begin to deeply understand the awesome thing God has done, and the profound beauty and obedience of Jesus. The beginning books of the Bible are essential to our understanding of God&#39;s redemptive story.</p><p>The publication of commentaries for children on neglected biblical books such as Exodus and Leviticus is noteworthy in itself.

The star of ABC's <em>Home Improvement</em>, the #1 show on television, Tim Allen has written the book millions have been awaiting--the naked truth about his outlook on life, love, and lathes. Allen's movie debut this November in <em>The Santa Clause</em> is certain to generate additional media attention. Line drawings.</p><p><strong>Tim Allen</strong> has won six People's Choice Awards for his television show,<em>Home Improvement</em>, and he was twice nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. His first feature film,<em>The Santa Clause</em>, was a number one hit, and his first book, <em>Don't Stand Too Close to a Naked Man</em>, was a number one bestseller. He lives with his wife and daughter in Los Angeles and Michigan.The spawn of Seinlanguage: shticky meditations by a stand-up comic who now stars in a top-rated television show. As Tim Taylor, Allen is the focal point of Home Improvement, but his manly-man persona plays off his wife, ``Tool Time'' cohorts, and other characters. Here we have Allen solo, closer to the stand-up mode, musing ``about many things I want to say about being a man.'' His short chapters mainly consist of riffs on his past, his humor safely in the middle American mainstream. Born Timothy Allen Dick, he learned to cope with his unusual moniker through humor and thus segues into observations genitalistic. Allen resents women saying men's cars are linked to their penises: ``What's an extension of the vagina--a purse?'' His life was transformed, he writes, by a Playboy centerfold, and he does have some wise thoughts on objectification: ``If we could have had sex with our cars and boats, it would have been a lot easier. But we'd be a smaller species.'' What should men ``look for in a gal? The answer is easy: breath.'' Allen balances such cheap laughs with some insights, suggesting that women, like men, seek glitz in a partner but eventually settle for ``the family station wagon.'' There's more: marriage, sports, and, of course, tools, leading to his innovative analysis of the impact of tool belts on butt cracks. He ends with some heartfelt sentiments on fatherhood. Allen only briefly touches on the traumas that have fueled his psyche: the death of his father in a car wreck when Tim was 11 and a prison sentence for selling drugs. (The lack of privacy in prison supplies the book's title.) More memoir and less shtick might have been a better balance here. For loyal fans, who should still be plentiful.

At the outset they tackle the ever-present question of what distinguishes public history from academic history, and they do so succinctly by identifying three key elements: audience, collaboration, and reflective practice (2&#x2013;3). They also provide a clear explanation of what unites academic and public history: historical thinking, historical methods, and heuristics.

In this Study Edition the complete vocabulary of the Hebrew Bible, including texts in Aramaic, is available. The dictionary combines scholarly thoroughness with easy accessibility, and so meets the needs of a wide range of users. The enormous advances that have taken place in the field of Semitic linguistics since the days of the older dictionaries of Classical Hebrew are well documented and assessed, as well as the often detailed discussions in modern Bible commentaries of words where the meaning is particularly difficult. The alphabetical ordering of entries rather than the traditional arrangement of words according to their roots is particularly helpful to the new student, and also saves the advanced user much time.

To answer this important question, Harlene Anderson invites us on a challenging, inspiring journey with an illuminating blend of postmodern theory and clinical narratives. We first meet a Swedish mother, whose experiences in therapy are wrought with frustration. The rest of the book is an answer to this mother's appeal, showing how therapists and clients can become conversational partners in a powerful process of transformation and change.Drawing on her experiences as a practitioner and teacher and on her clients' experiences of therapy, Harlene Anderson joins social thinkers who challenge the familiar culture of psychotherapy, including the foundations on which its theory, practice, research, and therapist education have been based. Anderson directly challenges the expert-nonexpert dichotomy and hierarchical structures that flow from it. She asserts that conventional premises and practices have lost their relevance in a world of rapid social transformation, and calls instead for a philosophy of therapy and a way of being in client relationships that invite collaboration.<i>Conversation, Language, and Possibilities</i> forges surprising links between postmodern theory and collaborative clinical practice. In this framework, human systems are viewed as systems of language and communication. Clients' voices are privileged. And language is generative in shaping&#x2014;and reshaping&#x2014;human life and relationships, creating potentials for positive change as infinite in variety and expression as the individuals who realize them.</p><p>Drawing on her experiences as a practitioner and teacher and on her clients&#39; experiences of therapy, Harlene Anderson joins social thinkers who challenge the familiar culture of psychotherapy, including the foundations on which its theory, practice, research, and therapist education have been based.

How can anyone say which side is right? </p><p>This new, expanded edition goes even further, calling on thirteen prominent writers and musicians to respond to themes ranging from sentiment and kitsch to cultural capital and musical snobbery. The original text is followed by lively arguments and stories from Nick Hornby, Krist Novoselic, Ann Powers, Mary Gaitskill, James Franco, Sheila Heti and others. </p><p>In a new afterword, Carl Wilson examines recent cultural changes in love and hate, including the impact of technology and social media on how taste works (or doesn't) in the 21st century.</p></p><p><p><b>Carl Wilson</b> is a writer and editor at <i>The Globe and Mail</i>, Canada's national newspaper, and his work also has appeared in <i>Pitchfork</i>, <i>Slate</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Blender </i>and many other publications.

Along with being a tremendously important piece of criticism, Let's Talk About Love is an agile, moving, and generous exploration of the music that accompanies us, welcome or not, on the travels we all need to make on our own. It is a beautiful, funny, unerringly concise book that invites repeated readings, new conversations, and a thoughtful engagement with the culture of our time.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>John K. Samson</i></p><p>&#x201c;The book is laugh-out-loud funny, whip-smart about contemporary thought, and fascinating in its many voices, but, readers, beware you may wind up humming that song for days afterward.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Eloise Kinney, Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;[I]t's a conversation worth having: as a dialogue between Wilson and his 13 disciples, with peers in social circles, and ultimately with oneself. Why we like what we like is always a fun topic to discuss, but it's often more challenging and more enlightening to discuss the converse: why we don't like what we don't like... Any investigation into cool is incomplete without due consideration of too-cool-for. Wilson has provided a primer for that discourse.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kurtt Gottshalk, Brooklyn Rail</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Let's Talk About Love...</i>is not just a critical study of one C�line Dion album, but an engaging discussion of pop criticism itself.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Elias Leight, LA Review of Books</i></p><p>&#x201c;...the recently updated <i>Let's Talk About Love</i>--cheekily re-subtitled <i>Why Other People Have Such Bad Taste</i> and bundled with a host of excellent accompanying essays from the book's admirers including Krist Novoselic, Nick Hornby, Ann Powers, and James Franco is a welcome excuse to revisit the main text in light of our current state of hyperspeed discourse. It's also a good excuse to catch up with Wilson, who continues to be an essential voice in the rock writer community while serving as Slate's music critic.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ryan Dombal, Pitchfork</i></p><p>&#x201c;In this gnostic context, Carl Wilson's Let's Talk About Love: A Journey to the End of Taste, first published in 2007, was a counter-intuitive masterstroke. Wilson's gamble--that even people who hate C�line Dion would be curious to read an entire book about why they hate her, and what that hatred might mean paid off handsomely: Let's Talk About Love was widely and enthusiastically reviewed outside the usual music-geek circles, Wilson appeared on NPR and The Colbert Report, and last year he was hired as Slate's chief music critic, as plum a gig as a pop critic can expect in today's collapsing media economy.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ellis Avery, Public Books</i></p><p>&#x201c;Freaking brilliant.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Will Hermes, Hippies and Hipsters</i></p><p>&#x201c;Carl Wilson's 2007 entry in the 33 1/3 library of pocket-sized books about classic albums is one of the most celebrated in the series. The author goes against the critical grain, not because he defends the music of this much-maligned international phenomenon. Wilson spends most of the book putting Dion into social and cultural context that in the end does not win him over to her kind of music. Wilson's book, unlike most criticism, openly invites dialogue, even providing an email contact for readers to beat their own breasts for and against C�line Dion.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Pat Padua, Spectrum Culture</i></p></p><h2>The Minimal Self: Psychic Survival in Troubled Times</h2><p><p><strong>"Even more valuable than its widely praised predecessor, <em>The Culture of Narcissism</em>." &#x2015;John W.

The authors approach babies as conscious beings who endure enormous stress during the birth process. They show how CS therapy can help restore the correct alignments in babies' bodies, freeing them to grow and attain their maximum potential without hindrance. The book focuses on what a trained CS therapist can do to remove the blockages that often arise during birth. It addresses both hands-on techniques and awareness of how to interact with a baby and what responses and effects to expect. Based on the authors&#x2019; extensive experience, this guide can also be used by parents or caregivers interested in knowing what babies need in order to be whole and healthy, and how to prevent problems &#x2014; including hyperactivity and ADD &#x2014; that could become serious and require medication later in life.</p><p>Etienne Peirsman has been a certified craniosacral therapist for over fifteen years.

They argue that if managers seriously want to develop effective strategies for competing in the new economy, they must understand the fundamental economics of information technology. Whether information takes the form of software code or recorded music, is published in a book or magazine, or even posted on a website, managers must know how to evaluate the consequences of pricing, protecting, and planning new versions of information products, services, and systems. The first book to distill the economics of information and networks into practical business strategies, Information Rules is a guide to the winning moves that can help business leaders navigate successfully through the tough decisions of the information economy.</p><p>Chapter 1 of <i>Information Rules</i> begins with a description of the change brought on by technology at the close of the century--but the century described is not this one, it's the late 1800s. One hundred years ago, it was an emerging telephone and electrical network that was transforming business. Today it's the Internet. The point? While the circumstances of a particular era may be unique, the underlying principles that describe the exchange of goods in a free-market economy are the same. And the authors, Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian, should know. Shapiro is Professor of Business Strategy at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley and has also served as chief economist at the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department. Varian is the Dean of the School of Information Management and Systems at UC Berkeley. Together they offer a deep knowledge of how economic systems work coupled with first-hand experience of today's network economy. They write: <blockquote> Sure, today's business world is different in a myriad of ways from that of a century ago. But many of today's managers are so focused on the trees of technological change that they fail to see the forest: the underlying economic forces that determine success and failure. </blockquote> Shapiro and Varian go to great lengths to purge this book of the technobabble and forecasting of an electronic woo-woo land that's typical in books of this genre. Instead, with their feet on the ground, they consider how to market and distribute goods in the network economy, citing examples from industries as diverse as airlines, software, entertainment, and communications. The authors cover issues such as pricing, intellectual property, versioning, lock-in, compatibility, and standards. Clearly written and presented, <i>Information Rules</i> belongs on the bookshelf of anyone who has an interest in today's network economy--entrepreneurs, managers, investors, students. If there was ever a textbook written on how to do business in the information age, this book is it. Highly recommended. <i>--Harry C.

We are hurtling ever faster towards climate catastrophe&#x2014;the destruction of a habitable world for many species, perhaps the near-extinction of our own. As anxieties about global temperatures soar, demands for urgent action grow louder. What can be done? Can this process be reversed? Once temperatures rise, is there any going back? Some are thinking about releasing aerosols into the stratosphere in order to reflect sunlight back into space and cool the earth. And this may be necessary, if it actually works. But it would only be the beginning; it&#x2019;s what comes after that counts.<br><br> In this groundbreaking book, Holly Jean Buck charts a possible course to a liveable future. Climate restoration will require not just innovative technologies to remove carbon from the atmosphere, but social and economic transformation. The steps we must take are enormous, and they must be taken soon. Looking at industrial-scale seaweed farms, the grinding of rocks to sequester carbon at the bottom of the sea, the restoration of wetlands, and reforestation, Buck examines possible methods for such transformations and meets the people developing them.<br><br> Both critical and utopian, speculative and realistic, <i>After Geoengineering</i> presents a series of possible futures. Rejecting the idea that technological solutions are some kind of easy workaround, Holly Jean Buck outlines the kind of social transformation that will be necessary to repair our relationship to the earth if we are to continue living here.</p><p><b>Holly Buck</b> writes on emerging technologies in the Anthropocene, with work appearing in journals such as <i>Development and Change</i>, <i>Climatic Change</i>, <i>Global Sustainability</i>, <i>Annals of the American Association of Geographers</i>, and <i>Hypatia</i>. Since 2009, she has been researching the social dimensions of geoengineering as a faculty fellow with the Forum for Climate Engineering Assessment in Washington, DC, as a member of the Steering Committee for the international Climate Engineering Conference in Berlin, and as a doctoral researcher at Cornell University, from which she holds a PhD in development sociology.&#x201c;A limpid synthesis of elegy and urgency. Unflinching about what looms for the world, Holly Buck outlines radical, transformative demands and agendas for a least-bad way forward, in the service of better ways thereafter.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;China Mi�ville, author of <i>October: the Story of the Russian Revolution</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This is the guide to the future.

It can no longer be wished away&#x2014;and thankfully, we have Holly Jean Buck to explain what it might look like and how it could be survived, perhaps even used for the good of the planet.

She decisively alters how the left might understand what anthropogenic intervention may require, both technologically and ethically. There are no easy solutions on offer, only difficult paths to cross while they are still open.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Benjamin H. Bratton, University of California, San Diego</b><br><br> &#x201c;Geoengineering is the &#x2018;third rail&#x2019; of left green politics that no one dares to touch. Holly Jean Buck transcends stale debates and allows us to imagine a hopeful world beyond both capitalism and climate catastrophe. Providing a rigorous (and joyful!) look at technological options to buy time, adapt to change, and renew the planet, this radical book is long overdue.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Paul Robbins, Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies</b><br><br> &#x201c;Climate is now an unmitigated disaster. Progressive activists are going to need to get up to speed on the emerging geoengineering industrial complex. Holly Jean Buck walks us briskly through what we need to know to engage with this deepening planetary crisis.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;McKenzie Wark, author of <i>Molecular Red</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;The topic of geoengineering usually merits a quick dismissal among environmentalists, but Holly Buck&#x2019;s <i>After Geoengineering</i> shows it is extremely complex with multiple available options. As emissions continue to rise and warming continues, this topic needs serious attention on the left since revolutionizing our energy system is likely not enough given what we&#x2019;ve already emitted. Buck&#x2019;s brilliant&#x2014;and hopeful&#x2014;overview is not merely technical or economic, but addresses head-on the implications for climate justice.

While culture is important, the author shows that innate evolutionary forces deeply influence the foods we eat, the gifts we offer, the cosmetics and clothing styles we choose to make ourselves more attractive to potential mates, and even the cultural products that stimulate our imaginations (such as art, music, and religion). The book demonstrates that most acts of consumption can be mapped onto four key Darwinian drives-namely, survival (we prefer foods high in calories); reproduction (we use products as sexual signals); kin selection (we naturally exchange gifts with family members); and reciprocal altruism (we enjoy offering gifts to close friends). The author further highlights the analogous behaviors that exist between human consumers and a wide range of animals.For anyone interested in the biological basis of human behavior or simply in what makes consumers tick-marketing professionals, advertisers, psychology mavens, and consumers themselves-this is a fascinating read.</p><p><b>Gad Saad, Ph.D.</b> (Montreal, Canada), a popular blogger for <i>Psychology Today</i> ("Homo-Consumericus"), is a professor of marketing at the John Molson School of Business at Concordia University. He holds the Concordia University Research Chair in Evolutionary Behavioral Sciences and Darwinian Consumption and is the author of <i>The Evolutionary Bases of Consumption</i>, plus numerous scientific papers."What's your guilty pleasure? Junk food? Fast cars? Champagne? To shop until you drop? What makes consumers tick? Psychologist Gad Saad writes of the innate needs, preferences, and drives that spur many of our most treasured appetites and behaviors&#x2014;all soft-wired into the human brain in deep history for purposes of survival and reproduction. We are natural born consumers. And as Saad elegantly examines our daily rituals and tastes (and he gives us troves of fascinating data from around the world), he brings our common human heritage to life. I'll never look at my high-heeled shoes or a buffet the same way again. It's <strong>a smart read for all who sell, all who buy</strong>, and all who really want to understand others and themselves. You may even come away thinking: I consume, therefore I am." --Helen Fisher, PhD, Biological Anthropologist, Rutgers University and author of <em>Why Him? Why Her?</em> <p>"I urge you to consume <em>The Consuming Instinct</em>! Using cogent examples from popular culture deftly mixed with an expert's grasp of modern evolutionary biology, Dr. Saad shows how our biology underlies our consumer choices. <strong>Like nothing else on the market today</strong>, it will help you understand why we purchase and pay attention as we do. Indeed, never has science for the lay-person been presented more cogently or accessibly when it comes to our daily economic activities." --David P. Barash, professor of psychology, University of Washington and co-author of <em>Payback: Why We Retaliate, Redirect Aggression and Take Revenge</em></p> <p>"Juicy burgers, Ferraris, pornography, and gift giving are the stuff of human nature. Evolutionary psychologist Gad Saad tells us just how and why, and much more, in <em>The Consuming Instinct</em>. With <strong>wit, charm, and crystal clarity</strong>, Saad lays bare the evolutionary underpinnings of consumerism." --Todd K. Shackelford, Ph.D., professor and Chair of Psychology, Oakland University, editor, <em>Evolutionary Psychology</em> (epjournal.net)<br></p> <p>"What the jacket does not say is just how <strong>entertaining, enlightening and informative</strong> this book is as Saad reveals the reasons behind consumers' preferences for fat burgers, fancy cars and the trendiest fashions�&#x20ac;�By putting forward the idea of evolutionary economics, Saad opens up new concepts in marketing as well as a much clearer understanding of why we respond to certain products the way we do�&#x20ac;�For those curious about the reasons people spend their hard-earned money on the things they do, presented in an understandable format then look no further." --Monsters and Critics<br><br></p></p><h2>The Little Book of Hanukkah (RP Minis)</h2><p>Here's a profound collection of Hanukkah traditions and celebrations, including quotations, songs, blessings, stories, games and recipes, contained within the pages of a Running Press; Miniature Edition&#x2122;.

Personable, witty, and insightful, Tenzin Palmo presents an inspiring and no-nonsense view of Buddhist practice.</p><p>Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo was raised in London and became a Buddhist while still in her teens. At the age of twenty she traveled to India, becoming one of the first Westerners to be ordained as a Buddhist nun. The international bestseller&nbsp;<i>Cave in the Snow</i>&nbsp;chronicles her twelve years of seclusion in a remote cave. Deeply concerned with the plight of Buddhist nuns, she established Dongyu Gatsal Ling Nunnery in India. In 2008 His Holiness the Twelfth Gyalwang Drukpa, head of the Drukpa Kagyu lineage, gave her the rare title of Jetsunma (Venerable Master).Excellent writing and a solid grasp of their subjects mark the efforts of these two authors. While both treat aspects of Buddhist thought, Boorstein's perspective derives from the Mahayana school, while Palmo's tradition is Tibetan. Boorstein (That's Funny, You Don't Look Buddhist) focuses on the ten paramitas (perfections of the heart), which include generosity, morality, renunciation, wisdom, energy, patience, truthfulness, determination, lovingkindness, and equanimity, and she devotes a chapter to each. (Of course, concepts like wisdom and equanimity are also a part of Tibetan Buddhism, but they operate differently in that tradition.) In each chapter, Boorstein follows the same format, first offering an explanation of what the particular paramita means within Buddhism, then instructing us on how to use the concept effectively in meditation, and finally illustrating the paramita with stories that grow out of her own experience and usefully show how that quality can be applied in life. By contrast, Palmo, a Buddhist nun, begins with a brief account of her life and training in Tibetan Buddhism. She then considers many of the major concepts of this school, including the six realms (e.g., hell, which she describes as a mind filled with anger; shamatha, or calm abiding; and vajrayana, or meditation that makes use of visualization). In addition, Palmo provides some wonderfully informative and useful chapters such as "Women and the Path" and "Difficult Points for Westerners." The latter includes an insightful discussion of karma and rebirth. Boorstein treats a more limited subject matter, while Palmo offers both greater breadth and depth. Both books are recommended, not only because they treat material from different schools of Buddhist thought but because both offer thorough explanations of their chosen subjects. Furthermore, the stories used to illustrate and clarify the various topics are effective and interesting, offering clear illustrations of how the teachings can be applied to life.

It has been re-translated and extensively revised, including material not found in the original translation. It is Altshuller&#39;s most popular book in Russia on how to become an inventor, and how to solve technical problems. The translator, Lev Shulyak, is himself an accomplished inventor, engineer and TRIZ expert.</p><p>TRIZ (the Russian acronym for Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) was developed by this book&#39;s author, Genrich Altshuller. Studied and respected around the world, TRIZ shows that technical systems evolve following predictable patterns. Consequently, inventiveness can be learned by anyone. Developed underground by Russian scientists, TRIZ has validated itself by solving thousands of difficult technical problems. Over 60,000 engineers world-wide are trained in TRIZ. In 1984, Lev Shulyak, translator of this book, taught the first U.S. TRIZ course. This edition has recently been translated into Japanese, Chinese and Spanish.&#34;This is an astonishing piece of work. It not only suggests and explains many effective thinking strategies for inventing, it introduces many resources like physics, chemistry and geometry as tools for solving invention problems and for predicting solutions for problems as yet unrecognized! &#34;In addition, it organizes into a coherent theory a great many of the ways a thinker can develop skill in approaching a problem where there is &#34;no answer&#34; -- where invention is necessary. &#34;And, to put the frosting on the cake, all of this is presented by inviting the reader to learn be doing. The author presents a marvelous variety of real problems where an invention is needed, and asks the reader to use one or another of the TRIZ techniques to invent a solution. &#34;The method is based on a study of thousands of inventions and provides many general principles for reducing a problem to its essentials, reexamining it with fresh eyes, and guiding the would-be inventor to specific areas of technology that are likely to help. &#34;I know of no other approach to inventing that offers such a rich arsenal of both practical and imaginative thinking tools. &#34;In a word, TRIZ is a treasure.&#34; Sincerly, George M.

The king orders Adelia Aguilar, expert in the science of death, to investigate-and hopefully stave off civil war. A reluctant Adelia finds herself once again in the company of Rowley Picot, the new Bishop of St. Albans...and her baby's father. Their discoveries into the crime are shocking- and omens of greater danger to come.</p><p>Ariana Franklin is the pen name of British writer Diana Norman. A bestselling author and former journalist, she lives in England with her husband, the film critic Barry Norman.Uniqueness of character and writing deserves Kate Reading's outstanding narration. Her well-paced, robust delivery takes us to the period of King Henry II at a time when his mistress has died and his estranged wife, Queen Eleanor, is suspect. Enter Adelia, sleuth, forensic specialist, and new mother. Reading gives Adelia the perfect portrait--her inquisitive and feisty confidence is layered with the tenderness of motherhood. Reading shifts easily to describe Adelia's faithful Muslim servant as well as her cocky, ribald lover--the father of her child--Bishop Rowley Picot. Minor characters are just as vivid. Reading succeeds at a formidable task: crossing genres of history, mystery, and politics; vividly transporting us to a foreign time and place; and credibly portraying Adelia's inner battles between feminism and passion.

In this book, Khenchen Thrangu, a beloved Mahamudra teacher, tells the extraordinary story of Tilopa&#x2019;s life and explains its profound lessons. He follows this story with a limpid and practical verse-by-verse commentary on the <i>Ganges Mahamudra</i>, explaining its precious instructions for realizing Mahamudra, the nature of one&#x2019;s mind. Throughout, Thrangu Rinpoche speaks plainly and directly to Westerners eager to receive the essence of Mahamudra instructions from an accomplished teacher.</p><p>Khenchen Thrangu is an eminent teacher of the Kagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. He was appointed by the Dalai Lama to be the personal tutor for His Holiness the Seventeenth Karmapa and has authored many books, including <i>The Mahamudra Lineage Prayer</i>, <i>Luminous Clarity</i>, <i>Advice from a Yogi</i>, <i>Pointing Out the Dharmakaya</i>, <i>Everyday Consciousness and Primordial Awareness</i>, and <i>Vivid Awareness</i>.&#x201c;As one of the greatest living teachers of the Kagyu lineage, Yongzin Khenchen Thrangu is eminently qualified to describe the life of the mahasiddha Tilopa, who founded that same lineage. Thrangu Rinpoche&#x2019;s clear exposition of Tilopa&#x2019;s magical life and deeply spiritual poetry will make it possible for more people to be inspired by these precious stories and Mahamudra teachings.&#x201d;&#x2014;The Twelfth Tai Situpa</p><h2>Foundation&#39;s Fears (Second Foundation Trilogy, 1)</h2><p><p> Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy is one of the high-water marks of science fiction. It is the monumental story of a Galactic Empire in decline, and the secret society of scientists who seek to shorten the inevitable Dark Age with the science of psychohistory. Now, with the permission -- and blessing -- of the Asimov estate, the epic saga continues.</p><p>Fate -- and a cruel Emperor's arbitrary power -- have thrust Hari Seldon into the First Ministership of the Empire against his will. As the story opens, Hari is about to leave his quiet professorship and take on the all but impossible task of administering 25 million inhabited worlds from the all-steel planet of Trantor. With the help of his beautiful bio-engineered "wife" Dors and his alien companion Yugo, Seldon is still developing the science that will transform history, never dreaming that it will ultimately pit him against future history's most awesome threat.</p></p><p>This is the first installment of The Second Foundation Trilogy, based on Isaac Asimov&#39;s famous Foundation series. Acclaimed hard science fiction writers Gregory Benford, David Brin, and Greg Bear will each produce a work for the trilogy. Benford kicks off exploring the beginnings of the Foundation itself and its creator, Hari Seldon.

In Part 2, McGinn discusses Western Christian mysticism proper, with special attention to Augustine of Hippo. Of special interest is the now-influential appendix, which reviews various theoretical approaches to mysticism.</p><p>Bernard McGinn is the Naomi Shenstone Donnelley Professor in the Divinity School of the University of Chicago. He is widely acknowledged as &#34;the world&#39;s greatest interpreter of Western mysticism&#34; (Choice). In addition to his comprehensive series &#34;The Presence of God,&#34; he is best known for his perceptive work on the writings of Meister Eckhart and the Beguines, and has been at the forefront of rediscovering the distinctly Christian elements in Eckhart&#39;s view of the God beyond God.It is important to remember that mysticism is always a process or a way of life. Although the essential note-or, better, goal-of mysticism may be conceived of as a particular kind of encounter between God and the human, between Infinite Spirit and the finite human spirit, everything that leads up to and prepares for this encounter, as well as all that flows from or is supposed to flow from it for the life of the individual in the belief community, is also mystical, even if in a secondary sense. Isolation of the goal from the process and the effect has led to much misunderstanding of the nature of mysticism and its role as an element of concrete religions. <p>This goal, essential characteristic, or defining note has most often been seen as an experience of some form of union with God, particularly a union of absorption or identity in which the individual personality is lost. If we define mysticism in this sense, there are actually so few mystics in the history of Christianity that one wonders why Christians ever used the qualifier "mystical" so often (from the late second century on) and eventually created the term "mysticism" (first in French, "la mystique") in the seventeenth century. This suggests that at the very least, it is necessary to expand the notion of union, recognizing that there were several, perhaps even many, understandings of union with God held by Christians over the centuries. But it may also be argued that union with God is not the most central category for understanding mysticism. </p><p>Inspired in part by the seminar work of Joseph Mar�chal, but especially by my reading of the texts that have been accepted as mystical classics in the history of Christianity, both East and West, I have come to find the term "presence" a more central and more useful category for grasping the unifying note in the varieties of Christian mysticism. Thus we can say that the mystical element in Christianity is that part of its belief and practices that concerns the preparation for, the consciousness of, and the reaction to what can be described as the immediate or direct presence of God.</p></p><h2>Valuing a Business, 5th Edition: The Analysis and Appraisal of Closely Held Companies (McGraw-Hill Library of Investment and Finance)</h2><p><p><b>Capitalize on All the Latest Legal, Financial, and Compliance Information Needed to Analyze and Appraise Any Business</b></p> <p>For over 25 years, <i>Valuing a Business</i> has provided professionals and students with expert business valuation information, offering clear, concise coverage of valuation principles and methods.

How does it really <em>work</em> and why is it the way it is? In what ways does it <em>need changing</em>, and how can those changes be brought about? To answer these questions, Wright and Rogers identify five core social values that most Americans affirm in one way or another: freedom, prosperity, efficiency, fairness, and democracy. The authors then challenge readers to question to what degree contemporary American society actually lives up to these values and suggest how we might make progress in solving some of the social problems that confront America today.</p><p><p><strong>Erik Olin Wright</strong> is arguably the most prominent scholar analyzing the social impact of class in the United States, and his research has mainly involved large-scale quantitative investigations of various themes connected to social inequality. Wright is the author of many books, including <em>Class Counts</em>, <em>Interrogating Inequality</em>, and <em>Classes</em>. He has also organized what he calls the &#x201c;Real Utopias Project,&#x201d; which explores a wide range of radical proposals for transforming the core institutions of contemporary society (and is also a series of books for Verso). In addition, he founded the A.E. Havens Center at the University of Wisconsin, whose mission is to foster dialogue between activists and academics and to encourage critical perspectives on contemporary social issues.</p><p><strong>Joel Rogers</strong>, a MacArthur Foundation "genius" prize-winner and identified by <em>Newsweek</em> as one of the 100 living Americans most likely to shape U.S. politics and culture in the twenty-first century, is professor of law, political science, public affairs, and sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The common thread in his academic work is democracy: how to define and measure it, what makes it work, how to make it work better. Rogers spends a lot of time outside the university advising people in politics, government, business, and social movements. He runs the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, which promotes &#x201c;high road&#x201d; (i.e., equitable, sustainable, democratic) economic development and governance, and has produced a stream of influential innovations in worker training; business and labor strategy; and local, state, and national policy.</p>&#x201c;<em>American Society: How It Really Works</em> is sociology at its best, theoretically grounded, empirically based, and tightly argued. Wright and Rogers provide a unique introduction to the sociological perspective by focusing on four core American social values&#x2015;efficiency, freedom, fairness, and democracy&#x2015;and show the ways that American society does not measure up to its potential, give sociological reasons why this is the case, and use the sociological imagination to suggest possible futures for a more just and equitable society. The perfect book not only to introduce students to sociological analysis, but to engage them in the major issues of our time.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Rhonda F. Levine, Colgate University</strong><br><br>&#x201c;There can be no better introduction to American society than one written by these two brilliant commentators.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Burawoy, University of California, Berkeley</strong><br><br>&#x201c;I used Wright and Rogers&#x2019;s <em>American Society</em> for an introductory sociology course. The text provided an accessible entrance into the fundamentals of sociological analysis, from economic principles and social inequality to mass consumption to participatory democracy. The work is clearly theoretically informed, but the most impressive contribution lies in the wealth of empirical studies, statistics, tables, and figures provided throughout the text. My students were particularly drawn to the empirical evidence and the consistent reference to contemporary debates about social issues, such as health care and campaign financing. The authors&#x2019; suggestions for ways to reduce social inequality ignited class discussions about the limits and potential of social change at the personal and structural level. I would recommend this text for any introductory sociology course focused on alternative understandings of social inequality in American society.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Robyn Autry, Wesleyan University</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Imagine a book about American social dynamics written by a pair of public intellectuals who are also eminent academics, aimed at beginners.

He redefined how Americans came to see the nation's chief executive.

He is also the author of <i>Voices of Protest: Huey Long, Father Coughlin, and the Great Depression</i>, which won the National Book Award, and <i>The End of Reform: New Deal Liberalism in Recession and War</i>. He was the Allan Nevins Professor of History at Columbia University and also taught at Harvard, Oxford, and Cambridge. He lived in New York City.1 <br>The Irish Prince <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born into an Irish American world that his family helped change forever. For generations, Americans of Irish descent had faced almost insuperable boundaries to their aspirations. Until the first decades of the twentieth century, most Irish Americans lived in insular communities and were largely excluded from many professions. They attended Catholic schools and&#x2014;for those who chose to enter politics&#x2014;ran for office in Irish wards and won votes from mostly Irish voters. Rarely did they attract support from outside their own communities. But the two families who gave birth to the first Irish American president broke new ground. <br>One of John Kennedy&#x2019;s grandfathers, John F. Fitzgerald, was himself a politician who crossed the boundaries that had limited Irish American ambitions. He was a charming, garrulous, energetic man who graduated from Boston College, enrolled briefly at Harvard Medical School, and was elected to Congress in 1894. Twelve years later, he became the first Irish American mayor of Boston, serving three terms between 1906 and 1914. For years, he remained one of the best-known political figures in the city. (He lived long enough to see his grandson elected to Congress, and he predicted that he would become president.) Fitzgerald&#x2019;s wife and second cousin, Mary Josephine Hannon, gave birth to six children. The eldest of them was Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald, born in 1890.1 <br>The future president&#x2019;s other grandfather was Patrick J. Kennedy, who left school at fourteen to support his large and struggling family. But despite his scant education and his impoverished beginnings, he saved his earnings and bought a small string of taverns and bars. Later he opened a liquor importing company and later still bought substantial interests in a coal company and a bank&#x2014;enterprises that made him a wealthy and substantial figure in the Irish American community. His wife, Mary Hickey, was herself the daughter of a prosperous tavern owner. She had four children&#x2014;among them Joseph P. Kennedy, born in 1888.2 <br>Rose Fitzgerald and Joseph Kennedy were exceptional young people within this enclosed world. Rose&#x2019;s eminent political family made her something of a celebrity at a young age. She attended elite Catholic schools and took an extensive tour of Europe. By the age of eighteen she had abandoned her early hopes to attend Wellesley College to join her father&#x2019;s political life.3 <br>Joe Kennedy, although from a less eminent family than Rose&#x2019;s, was more ambitious&#x2014;and more successful&#x2014;than almost anyone else in the Irish community. He attended the prestigious Boston Latin School, graduated from Harvard, and moved into banking. By the age of twenty-five, he was the president of Columbia Trust, a modest bank in which his father had once invested. Joe quickly doubled its accounts.4 <br>Rose and Joe had become attracted to each other as early as 1906, when she was sixteen and he eighteen. Rose&#x2019;s father had another suitor in mind for his daughter&#x2014;a wealthy contractor and friend of the family&#x2014;and Fitzgerald tried for years to keep her apart from Joe. But Rose found Joe a much more compelling figure than her father&#x2019;s choice, and she wore him down. They were married in 1914, and they broke with tradition by moving to a house in Brookline, then an almost entirely Protestant community. Their first son, Joseph Patrick Kennedy Jr., was born in 1915. Two years later, on May 29, 1917, their second son&#x2014;John Fitzgerald Kennedy&#x2014;was born.5 <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Life in the Kennedy family was dominated by Joe&#x2019;s social ambitions and his spectacular financial success. His marriage to the mayor&#x2019;s daughter was only one of many steps that would lead him and his children well beyond the Irish world in which they were born. Joe was smart, ambitious, and often ruthless&#x2014;determined not only to accumulate wealth but also to gain power. Banking, he believed, was the key to the kind of success he sought. &#x201c;I saw, even in my limited dealings, that sooner or later, the source of business was traced to the banks,&#x201d; he wrote later. Banking, he claimed, &#x201c;could lead a man anywhere, as it played an important part in every business.&#x201d;6 <br>It was not just power and wealth he sought. He could have had a prosperous career as the most eminent Irish banker in the city, but he aspired to rise higher. He wanted to move into the great world of finance&#x2014;a world dominated by old Yankee families in Boston and New York. World War I interrupted his plans. He left the bank and became a manager of war production at the Bethlehem steel yards in Quincy, Massachusetts. When the army tried to draft him, the Bethlehem executives fought to keep him, calling him indispensable. His success in a world of Yankee businessmen helped draw him into larger and larger worlds. &#x201c;The key to Kennedy&#x2019;s spectacular financial success,&#x201d; one of his colleagues later said, &#x201c;was his anticipation of the future&nbsp;&#x2026; his vision of what lay down the road, a vision that was always there, sustaining him and guiding him&#x2014;that vision was simply phenomenal.&#x201d;7 In the heady days of the stock market boom in the 1920s, he joined a Brahmin brokerage house, where he expanded his connections in the financial world and became one of the canniest and most successful investors of his era. By 1927, he had relocated his family to Riverdale, just north of Manhattan, where he could be closer to Wall Street. Even before the family&#x2019;s move, he had accumulated over $2 million, which was only the beginning of his extraordinary rise. <br>Joe&#x2019;s remarkable success created problems for Rose. She wanted an ordered and respectable domesticity. But Joe was not much of a partner in the home&#x2014;traveling constantly, working late, and always looking for new connections and new opportunities. That left Rose alone in a large and complicated home. By the early 1930s, there were nine children: Joe Jr., Jack, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Pat, Bobby, Jean, and Ted. It was a loud, boisterous, and at times chaotic household that never lived up to Rose&#x2019;s hopes&#x2014;perhaps in part because Rose herself was either pregnant or recovering from pregnancy for the first seventeen years of her marriage. After the family moved to Riverdale, they retained a foothold in Massachusetts. Joe purchased a large property in Hyannis Port that became the family&#x2019;s most enduring home. The celebrated pictures of the Kennedy family in later years&#x2014;sailing off the coast of Cape Cod, playing touch football on the lawn&#x2014;were a reminder of decades of outdoor activity and competitive sports. Long before the Kennedys became politically active, the family had already become among the most famous Irish American families in America&#x2014;a result of Joe&#x2019;s enormous and conspicuous wealth, and also because of the attractive image of the Kennedy tribe.8 <br>But the attractive, even idyllic, images of this apparently golden family disguised its share of troubles. Rose remained overwhelmed by her large family, particularly after their first daughter, Rosemary, was diagnosed as mildly retarded. Rose had few friends and few activities in New York beyond taking care of her growing family. She distanced herself from her husband sexually except for procreation and traveled extensively around America and Europe to escape the pressures of home. Her absence dismayed her children (and especially Jack). Joe Sr. was still mostly away, traveling on business and expanding his business empire&#x2014;including an investment in the movie industry. He also maintained an extramarital sexual life&#x2014;most conspicuously with the actress Gloria Swanson. The children grew up supervised for long periods by servants and relatives.9 <br>Rosemary aside, Jack had the most difficult life of the family. He was under the shadow of his older brother, Joe Jr., who was the recipient of his father&#x2019;s greatest hopes. Jack developed a competitive relationship with his older brother, who almost always won whatever contests they waged. But a more important part of his youth&#x2014;and indeed of much of his life&#x2014;was the long history of illness that began shortly after birth. He was restless and fitful even as a baby, had trouble digesting milk, and suffered frequent stomachaches. By the time he was three, he had experienced scarlet fever, causing his mother &#x201c;frantic terror&#x201d; and leading his father to spend hours praying (uncharacteristically) in the Catholic Church, which he rarely attended.10 This frightening illness was followed by other debilitating diseases (chicken pox, ear infections, and undiagnosed stomach, intestinal, and other ailments that made it difficult for him to eat and sometimes left him so weak that he could hardly stand). Sickness plagued him into adolescence and beyond, baffling his doctors, his family, and Jack himself. For months at a time, he was gaunt, pale, and weak. Multiple and often mistaken diagnoses added to his ordeal. Treatment for one problem created problems elsewhere, and there was no definitive explanation of what ailed him. Jack liked to joke about his frequent illnesses, and he tried to disguise the pain and fear that he often felt. But there were also periods of near despair, especially when he was in hospitals for weeks, submitting to endless tests, and still failing to get any answers to what his problems were.11 <br>His illnesses inevitably affected his schooling. Shortly after the family&#x2019;s move to New York, Jack was enrolled in the Riverdale Country School. But at the age of thirteen, with his grades an undistinguished C+ average, his parents decided he should go to boarding school. Rose Kennedy was especially eager to get the boys out of the house because she felt so overwhelmed by her many children. Jack expected to follow Joe Jr. to Choate, the distinguished boarding school in Wallingford, Connecticut, but Rose&#x2014;on her own&#x2014;decided in the fall of 1930 to send him instead to Canterbury, a Catholic school for boys in New Milford, Connecticut. He suffered there not only from his chronic ailments but also from homesickness. He complained to his family about the &#x201c;whole lot of religion&#x201d; and the isolation of the school. (&#x201c;The only time you can get out of here is to see the Harvard-Yale and Army-Yale [games].&#x201d;)12 Much of the time he was in the local hospital, and he spent the last months of the academic year at home, with tutors.13 <br>The following fall, he enrolled at Choate, which he found more tolerable because his brother Joe was already there. Jack remained a lackluster student. He was constantly reprimanded by his teachers and the headmaster, who considered him &#x201c;one of the most undependable boys&#x201d; in his grade. He lacked &#x201c;application.&#x201d; He was &#x201c;careless&#x201d; with his work. He was notoriously &#x201c;casual and disorderly&#x201d; in a school committed to order.14 He insisted that he was &#x201c;trying to be a more socially minded person.&#x201d;15 Everyone agreed that he was intelligent, but that made his scholarly &#x201c;mediocrity&#x201d; all the more damning.16 Inattention was only one of his problems, for he fell victim soon again to his puzzling and often debilitating illnesses. At one point, according to his lifelong friend Lem Billings, he &#x201c;came very close to dying.&#x201d;17 He was in and out of the infirmary and local hospitals, trying to lead a normal life, and struggling to keep up with his work. Through it all, he forced himself to remain cheerful, funny, and almost irresistibly charming. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never known anyone in my life with such a wonderful humor&#x2014;the ability to make one laugh and have a good time,&#x201d; Billings once wrote.18 &#x201c;Jack didn&#x2019;t like to be too serious,&#x201d; the Choate headmaster said long after Jack left the school. &#x201c;He had a delightful sense of humor always&nbsp;&#x2026; He was a very likeable person, very lovable.&#x201d;19 <br>Living in the shadow of his older brother was difficult. Joe excelled in athletics, discipline, and leadership. Jack could not compete. He did not like Choate very much more than he had liked Canterbury, and he often described it as a prison. But he made his way through his school years with garrulous charm and wit. It was not surprising that his jokes were often dark, because his health continued to deteriorate. He spent weeks at the Mayo Clinic, where he submitted to what seemed endless, humiliating tests. But as usual in his letters to Billings he treated it all as a joke. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m still eating peas and corn for food and I had an enema given by a beautiful blonde,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;That, my sweet, is the height of cheap thrills.&#x201d;20 <br>Partly to compensate for his inability to thrive in sports or academics, he developed a new sexual prowess that lasted through the rest of his life. Like his father, he treated sex as a kind of sport&#x2014;casual, frequent, mostly unconnected to affection or romance. Most of his trysts were one-night stands, and he sometimes forgot the names of his sexual partners. The constricted world of Choate did not make sexual activity easy, but he found ways to get around the boundaries of the school in the same way he got around his illnesses.21 <br>Jack&#x2019;s disaffection&#x2014;his illnesses, his poor academic performance, and his disdain for the stuffy traditions of the school&#x2014;led him to join a group of similarly alienated students to form &#x201c;the Muckers Club.&#x201d; ( <i>Mucker</i> was a term coined by the faculty to describe rebellious students with little respect for the &#x201c;Choate culture.&#x201d; Jack&#x2019;s father, somewhat in sympathy with his son, later noted that if he had organized the club, its name would not have begun with an <i>M</i>.) The Muckers composed and sang vaguely obscene songs, sometimes about teachers. They organized pranks that mocked the staid habits of the school. The headmaster called them &#x201c;a colossally selfish, pleasure loving, unperceptive group&#x201d; and nearly expelled the entire group. Rose Kennedy, horrified by Jack&#x2019;s rebelliousness, liked to believe that this confrontation with the headmaster was a turning point in his life&#x2014;that he had learned to respect authority and to live by the norms of the school. But Jack was far from tamed. He avoided the more dangerous behavior that had created trouble for the Muckers, but he could not resist a final challenge to the Choate establishment by launching a successful campaign for the title of &#x201c;Most Likely to Succeed,&#x201d; using his popularity to defeat the more obvious candidates.22 <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Jack&#x2019;s path to college was as rocky as his path through prep school had been. He enrolled at Harvard for the fall of 1935, then withdrew before the term began to go to England to spend a year at the London School of Economics. But the onset of another mysterious illness, and his disappointment with the LSE, drew him back to America, where&#x2014;weeks after the term had begun&#x2014;he enrolled at Princeton, primarily because Lem Billings and other friends were already there. His enthusiasm for Princeton soon cooled. He found it provincial and oppressive&#x2014;with its Protestantism, its small-town environs, and its eating-club culture that did not often welcome Catholics. &#x201c;I think he was a little disenchanted with the country-club atmosphere of Princeton,&#x201d; one of his friends later wrote.23 <br>Before he finished his first term, he was rushed to Boston and was hospitalized with yet another apparently undiagnosable illness. After weeks of invasive and humiliating tests&#x2014;&#x201c;the most harrowing experience of all my storm-tossed career,&#x201d; he wrote to Billings&#x2014;he was diagnosed with leukemia. &#x201c;Took a peek at my chart yesterday and could see that they were mentally measuring me for a coffin,&#x201d; he reported.24 But he refused to take the diagnosis seriously. He was vindicated when the doctors finally admitted that they had been in error. He spent the rest of his aborted academic year trying to restore himself to health&#x2014;through vacations at Palm Beach, a few Teddy Roosevelt&#x2013;like months on a ranch in Arizona, and a libidinous week in Los Angeles.

What causes seasons to change? And if you fire a bullet from a gun and drop one from your hand, which bullet hits the ground first? In a pinch we almost always get these questions wrong. Worse, we regularly misconstrue fundamental qualities of the world around us. In <i>Scienceblind</i>, cognitive and developmental psychologist Andrew Shtulman shows that the root of our misconceptions lies in the theories about the world we develop as children. They're not only wrong, they close our minds to ideas inconsistent with them, making us unable to learn science later in life. So how do we get the world right? We must dismantle our intuitive theories and rebuild our knowledge from its foundations. The reward won't just be a truer picture of the world, but clearer solutions to many controversies--around vaccines, climate change, or evolution--that plague our politics today.<br></p><p><b>Andrew Shtulman </b>is an associate professor of psychology and cognitive science at Occidental, where he directs the Thinking Lab.

This time, with Jury off in Ireland, Plant takes the starring role. His vacation in picturesque Bletchley on the Cornwall coast is very nearly ruined by the coincidental appearance of his dreaded Aunt Agatha. Ironically, however, he is drawn to the plight of a young man, Johnny Wells, whose favorite aunt has disappeared suddenly without trace. In spite of Agatha, Plant decides to lease a house owned by an American millionaire whose two grandchildren died tragically on the beach a few years before. Within a day or so, a new dead body is found in neighboring Lamorna: that of Sada Colthorp, a young woman who had lived in the area but left to dabble in porn movies. Plant and divisional police commander Brian Macalvie (<i>Help the Poor Struggler</i>) believes there's a link between Colthorp and the missing Chris Wells. When the pieces start to come together (and a fast string of violence ensues), Jury makes a token appearance to tie up the remaining loose ends. But the day really belongs to Plant, who is becoming much more than an accidental detective, and to Macalvie, a character with an appeal that may eclipse even Jury's.<p> As always, Grimes provides comic relief at the expense of a tight plot by checking in with the myriad other characters who populate Plant's Long Piddleton and Jury's London. The impatient reader may wonder when, if ever, Plant and friends will cease their juvenile heckling of Vivian Rivington's Italian count. The final explanation of the children's deaths, however, will leave the most stoic mystery fan feeling distinctly queasy. That Grimes can so effectively amuse, shock, intrigue, and even irritate after 16 books bodes well for the continuing life of the series. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p>Scotland Yard Superintendent Richard Jury returns -- but not before sidekick Melrose Plant finds himself embroiled in a haunting case of murder past and present.<p>With his good friend Richard Jury on a fool's errand in Northern Ireland, Melrose Plant tries -- in vain -- to escape his aunt and his Long Piddleton lethargy by fleeing to Cornwall. There, high on a rocky promontory overlooking the sea, he rents a house -- one furnished with tragic memories. But his Cornwallian reveries are tempered by the local waiter/cab driver/amateur magician. The industrious Johnny Wells seems unflappable -- until his beloved aunt disappears. Now, Plant is dragged into the disturbing pasts of everyone involved -- and a murder mystery that only Richard Jury can solve....</p></p><h2>A God in the House: Poets Talk About Faith (The Tupelo Press Lineage Series)</h2><p>Literary Nonfiction. Poetry. Editors Ilya Kaminsky and Katherine Towler have gathered conversations with nineteen of America&#39;s leading poets, reflecting upon their diverse experiences with spirituality and the craft of writing. Bringing together poets who are Christian, Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim, Pagan, Native American, Wiccan, agnostic, and otherwise, this book offers frank and thoughtful consideration of themes too often polarized and politicized in our society. Participants include Li-Young Lee, Jane Hirshfield, Carolyn Forch�, Gerald Stern, Christian Wiman, Joy Harjo, and Gregory Orr, and others, all wrestling with difficult questions of human existence and the sources of art.</p><p><strong>Ilya Kaminsky</strong> was born in Odessa, former Soviet Union in 1977. His debut collection was DANCING IN ODESSA (Tupelo Press, 2004). Among his awards are the Whiting Prize, the Metcalf Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the 2005 Foreword Poetry Book of the Year award."The intimate relationship between poetry and prayer, explored anew in this wide-ranging collection of interviews, animates some of our most vital writing. These poets are wonderful guides to the endlessly changing terrain of spiritual practice. . . ." --<i>Christopher Merrill, author of </i>Things of the Hidden God: Journey to the Holy Mountain<p> "An incandescent collection of essays, superbly edited, radiant with wisdom, demonstrating the great truth that all poetry, all art, all human endeavor finds its fulfillment in service to something higher than itself. . . .

Gary Snyder worked as a logger and forest ranger; "Far East"&#x2015;poems written between 1956 and 1964 in Japan where he studied Zen at the monastery in Kyoto; "Kali"&#x2015;poems inspired by a visit to India and his reading of Indian religious texts, particularly those of Shivaism and Tibetan Buddhism; and "Back"&#x2015;poems done on his return to this country in 1964 which look again at our West with the eyes of India and Japan. The book concludes with a group of translations of the Japanese poet Miyazawa Kenji (1896-1933), with whose work Snyder feels a close affinity. The title, <em>The Back Country</em>, has three major associations; wilderness. the "backward" countries, and the &#x201c;back country" of the mind with its levels of being in the unconscious.</p><p><b>The Back Country</b> is one of Gary Snyder's most serious engagements with Eastern culture and thought. Much of the book works to achieve a perspective by means of contrast, as in "Hitch Haiku," a series of haiku (a Japanese form of imagistic, syllabic verse) mostly set in the American West. Perhaps the strongest poem is "Oil," in which Snyder envisions a tanker as a needle bringing our addicted nation "long injections of pure oil."&#39;A reaffirmation of a back country of the spirit&#39;, this collection is made up of four sections: &#39;Far West&#39;, &#39;Far East&#39;, &#39;Kali&#39;, and &#39;Back&#39;.

Vietnamese monk and world teacher Thich Nhat Hanh tackles this most difficult of emotions in <i>Anger</i>. A master at putting complex ideas into simple, colorful packages, Nhat Hanh tells us that, fundamentally, to be angry is to suffer, and that it is our responsibility to alleviate our own suffering. The way to do this is not to fight our emotions or to "let it all out" but to transform ourselves through mindfulness. Emphasizing our basic interdependence, he teaches us how to help others through deep listening and how to water the positive seeds in those around us while starving the negative seeds. Serious though lighthearted, <i>Anger</i> is a handbook not only for transforming anger but for living each moment beautifully. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese poet, bestselling author and peace activist, has been a Buddhist monk for over 40 years. He was chairman of the Vietnamese Buddhist Peace delegation during the Vietnam War and was nominated by Dr Martin Luther King for the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1966 he visited the US and Europe on a peace mission and was unable to return to his native land.

This gap persists despite the hard, often heroic work done by many teachers and administrators. Schmoker believes that teachers and administrators may know what the best practices are, but they aren'&#x2019;t using them or reinforcing them consistently. He asserts that our schools are protected by a buffer&#x2014;a protective barrier that prevents scrutiny of instruction by outsiders. The buffer exists within the school as well. Teachers often know only what is going on in their classrooms&#x2014;and they may be completely in the dark about what other teachers in the school are doing. Even principals, says Schmoker, don&#x2019;t have a clear view of the daily practices of teaching and learning in their schools.</p><p>Schmoker suggests that we need to get beyond this buffer to confront the truth about what is happening in classrooms, and to allow teachers to learn from each other and to be supervised properly. He outlines a plan that focuses on the importance of consistent curriculum, authentic literacy education, and professional learning communities for teachers.</p><p>What will students get out of this new approach? Learning for life. Schmoker argues passionately that students become learners for life when they have more opportunities to engage in strategic reading, writing with explicit guidance, and argument and discussion.</p><p>Through strong teamwork, true leadership, and authentic learning, schools and their students can reach new heights. Results Now is a rally cry for educators to focus on what counts. If they do, Schmoker promises, the entire school community can count on unprecedented achievements.</p></p><p></p><h2>Butterflies through Binoculars: The East A Field Guide to the Butterflies of Eastern North America</h2><p>This magnificent field guide greatly expands on <em>Butterflies Through Binoculars: The Boston-New York-Washington Region</em>--identified by <em>Defenders of Wildlife Magazine</em> as "the first to focus on netless butterflying" and called " a clear winner" by the <em>Audubon Naturalist</em>.

Kerney agrees and plans a working vacation on location, in a remote area of the state known as the Bootheel, with his wife, Lt. Colonel Sara Brannon, and their three-year-old son, Patrick. But, a dead man on the road near an isolated border crossing, a federal undercover investigation into immigrant smuggling, the search for a fugitive from military justice hiding somewhere in Europe, and Johnny Jordan's troublesome behavior all ensure that nothing goes as planned.<br><br> As separate investigations embroil them in circumstances that will forever change their lives, Kerney must care for Patrick while Sara plays a dangerous game of Pentagon politics. Packed with family secrets, international intrigue, and memorable characters, this is McGarrity's most ambitious and involving novel to date-- traveling an accelerating arc from Santa Fe to the desert grasslands and mountains of the Bootheel, to the most secret levels of the Pentagon, to a resort town on the coast of Ireland, and back to an adrenaline-charged climax on a desolate landing strip a few miles north of the Mexican border.</p><p>Michael McGarrity is author of the Anthony Award-nominated <b>Tularosa</b>, <b>Mexican Hat</b>, <b>Serpent Gate</b>, <b>Hermit's Peak</b>, <b>The Judas Judge</b>, <b>Under the Color of Law</b>, and <b>The Big Gamble</b>. A former deputy sheriff for Santa Fe County, he established the first Sex Crimes Unit. He has also served as an instructor at the New Mexico Law Enforcement Academy and as an investigator for the New Mexico Public Defender's Office.Returning from 2004's <i>Slow Kill</i>, stoic Sante Fe police chief Kevin Kerney receives an unexpected visit from Johnny Jordan, a childhood friend and now cantankerous former rodeo pro, who convinces Kerney to serve as a technical adviser in the shooting of a local western film. Eager for a break, Kerney heads to the location in southwestern Bootheel with his lovely wife, Army Lt. Col. Sara Brannon, and his young son, Patrick, in tow. But what starts out as a working vacation in this seventh Kerney outing quickly detours into a bloody crime scene when the body of an undercover Border Patrol agent is dumped onto Highway 81. In no time, U.S. Customs joins Kerney's investigation into a possible illegal immigrant and drug smuggling operation. Meanwhile, Sara's army job unexpectedly takes her to Ireland where she must track down and seize the notorious George Spalding, a gemstone smuggler and wartime deserter. McGarrity focuses on the details of the settings and on the characters' tactical maneuvers career- and parenting-wise. The result is slightly amplified sleuthing, deftly swapped out at surprising moments to the POV of the bad guys, and with fine but low-grade intensity. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now Richard Zenith has collected in a single volume all the major poetry of "one of the most extraordinary poetic talents the century has produced" (Microsoft Network's Reading Forum). Fernando Pessoa was as much a creator of personas as he was of poetry, prose, and criticism. He wrote under numerous "heteronyms," literary alter egos with fully fleshed identities and writing styles, who supported and criticized each other's work in the margins of his drafts and in the literary journals of the time. From spare minimalism to a revolutionary exuberance that recalls Leaves of Grass, Pessoa's oeuvre was radically new and anticipated contemporary literary concerns to an unnerving degree.

My kids LOVED running their fingers over a quilt and seeing "their" shirts and recalling memories of when they wore them. Even boys like seeing a part of their life in a quilt! --Saska K.<br><br>Bonnie's concepts and patterns are a quiltmaker's delight! She combines traditional blocks with innovative fabric choices that result in distinctive quilts that are easy-to-make.

He has written for <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>GQ</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Spin</i>, <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>The Believer,</i> <i>Billboard</i>, <i>The A.V. Club</i>, and ESPN. Klosterman served as the Ethicist for <i>The New York Times Magazine </i>for three years, and was an original founder of the website Grantland with Bill Simmons.The author reads various articles he's written for "smart" publications that amusingly record his observations of cultural ephemera. A specialist in inconsequence, he writes glibly about the passing scene in clever phrases. This volume includes profiles of celebrities, opinion pieces, and a smattering of short fiction. His vocal skill is less felicitous than his writing. On the positive side, he adopts a light, chatty tone and a brisk pace that nicely complement his text. He does have some flair as a raconteur. But his scratchy voice grates on this reviewer's nerves, as does his sloppy diction and air of in-crowd smugness. Perhaps a younger trend-conscious listener will have more appreciation for Klosterman's virtues and less impatience with his faults.

Written by an eminent theologian, it combines in its narrative a rare blend of clarity, unity, and balance. In light of significant advances in scholarship in recent years, extensive revisions have been made to this fourth edition. Three scholars from Union Theological Seminary in New York have incorporated new historical discoveries and provided fresh interpretations of various periods in church history from the first century to the twentieth. The result is a thoroughly updated history which preserves the tenor and structure of Walker's original, unparalleled text.</p><p>Since publication of the first edition in 1918, A History of the Christian Church has enjoyed success and recognition as a classic in the field.

He received his A. B. degree from Amherst College in 1883, was graduated from Hartford Theological Seminary in 1886 and received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Leipzig in 1888. He succeeded Woodrow Wilson as associate professor of history at Bryn Mawr College. He later taught church history at Hartford Theological Seminary. In 1901 Yale University called him to succeed George Park Fisher as Titus Street Professor of Ecclesiastical History, a position which he held until his death in 1922. <i>The Reformation, Ten New England Leaders, Great Men of the Christian Church,</i> and <i>A History of the Christian Church</i> are among his distinguished works.</p><h2>Book, A</h2><p><p><b>Desi Arnaz&#x2019;s incredible life story&#x2014;in his own words.</b></p><p>Desi Arnaz&#x2019;s memoir tells the story of how a kid from Cuba hit the big time in the United States.

His father was the mayor of Santiago. The 1933 revolution led by Fulgencio Batista had landed his father in jail and stripped the family of its wealth, property and power. His father was released because of the intercession of U.S. officials who believed him to be neutral during the revolt. The family fled to Miami, Florida. One of Desi&#39;s first jobs in America consisted of cleaning canary cages. However, after forming his own small band of musicians, he was hired by Xavier Cugat, the &#34;king&#34; of Latin music. Desi soon left Cugat, formed his own Latin band and literally launched the conga craze in America. he was cast in the Broadway play &#34;Too Many Girls&#34;, resulting in his being brought to Hollywood to make the film version of the play. It was on the set of Too Many Girls (1940) that he and Lucille Ball met. They soon married and approximately ten years later formed Desilu Productions and began the I Love Lucy (1951) shows. Desi and Lucille had two children, Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr.. At the end of the I Love Lucy (1951) run (including the The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour (1957)) the two divorced.

Her prose illustrates vividly the value of simplicity, the natural world, and the balance of life within it.Money. Always a problem. A young girl feels her family is too poor, and she calls a family meeting to discuss the question of money. But by giving another definition of rich, her folks set her straight: They are indeed rich in ways immeasurable by the dollar (although they assign monetary values to their pleasures for the purposes of the meeting). The family members lead lives of great deliberation, being where they want to be, doing what they choose to do. Sunrise, ocean waves, the smell of rain, mountain shadows, bird calls--these all add up (to $60,000, to be precise). And, of course, they have each other, which is worth $4,000,000 more. The final tally, without even including what they actually earn, comes to $4,060,000. So they are rich. Baylor's (Your Own Best Secret Place, 1991, etc.) story can be clumsy, even ham-handed, but the message is immediate. More problematic are the illustrations: Peter Max-like psychedelia meets Outdoor Life in a fusion that crashes and burns. (Fiction/Picture book. 7-10) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Scott Fitzgerald at a country club dance in 1918, she is seventeen years old and he is a young army lieutenant stationed in Alabama. Before long, the "ungettable" Zelda has fallen for him despite his unsuitability: Scott isn't wealthy or prominent or even a Southerner, and keeps insisting, absurdly, that his writing will bring him both fortune and fame. Her father is deeply unimpressed.

Our house, a roomy Victorian on Pleasant Avenue, was wrapped in the tiny white blooms of Confederate jasmine and the purple splendor of morning glories. It was a Saturday, and early yet, and cloudy. Birds had congregated in the big magnolia tree and were singing at top volume as if auditioning to be soloists in a Sunday choir. <br>From our back stairway&#x2019;s window I saw a slow horse pulling a rickety wagon. Behind it walked two colored women who called out the names of vegetables as they went. <i>Beets! Sweet peas! Turnips!</i> they sang, louder even than the birds. <br>&#x201c;Hey, Katy,&#x201d; I said, coming into the kitchen. &#x201c;Bess and Clara are out there, did you hear &#x2019;em?&#x201d; On the wide wooden table was a platter covered by a dish towel. &#x201c;Plain?&#x201d; I asked hopefully, reaching beneath the towel for a biscuit. <br>&#x201c;No, cheese&#x2014;now, don&#x2019;t make that face,&#x201d; she said, opening the door to wave to her friends. &#x201c;Nothin&#x2019; today!&#x201d; she shouted. Turning to me, she said, &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t have peach preserves every day of your life.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Old Aunt Julia said that was the only thing keepin&#x2019; me sweet enough to evade the devil.&#x201d; I bit into the biscuit and said, mouth full, &#x201c;Are the Lord and Lady still asleep?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They both in the parlor, which I &#x2019;spect you know since you used the back stairway.&#x201d; <br>I set my biscuit aside so as to roll my blue skirt&#x2019;s waistband one more turn, allowing another inch of skin to show above my bare ankles. &#x201c;There.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Maybe I best get you the preserves after all,&#x201d; Katy told me, shaking her head. &#x201c;You mean to wear shoes, at least.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s too hot&#x2014;and if it rains, they&#x2019;ll just get soaked and my toes&#x2019;ll prune up and the skin&#x2019;ll peel and then I&#x2019;ll <i>have</i> to go shoeless and I <i>can&#x2019;t,</i> I have my ballet solo tonight.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;My own mama would whip me if I&#x2019;s to go in public like that,&#x201d; Katy clucked. <br>&#x201c;She would not, you&#x2019;re thirty years old.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You think that matter to her?&#x201d; <br>I thought of how my parents still counseled and lectured my three sisters and my brother, all at least seven years older than me, all full adults with children of their own&#x2014;except for Rosalind. Tootsie, we call her. She and Newman, who was off fighting in France, same as our sister Tilde&#x2019;s husband, John, were taking their time about parenthood&#x2014;or maybe it was taking its time about them. And I thought of how my grandmother Musidora, when she lived with us, couldn&#x2019;t help advising Daddy about everything from his haircuts to his rulings. The thing, then, was to get away from one&#x2019;s parents, and stay away. <br>&#x201c;Anyway, never mind,&#x201d; I said as I went for the back door, sure that my escape was at hand. &#x201c;Long as no one here sees me&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Baby!&#x201d; I jumped at Mama&#x2019;s voice coming from the doorway behind us. &#x201c;For heaven&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c; <i>where</i> are your stockings and shoes?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just goin&#x2019;&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;&#x2014;right back to your room to get dressed. You can&#x2019;t think you were walking to town that way!&#x201d; <br>Katy said, &#x201c;S&#x2019;cuse me, I just remembered we low on turnips,&#x201d; and out she went. <br>&#x201c;Not to town,&#x201d; I lied. &#x201c;To the orchard. I&#x2019;m goin&#x2019; to practice for tonight.&#x201d; I extended my arms and did a graceful pli�. <br>Mama said, &#x201c;Yes, lovely. I&#x2019;m sure, however, that there&#x2019;s no time for practice; didn&#x2019;t you say the Red Cross meeting starts at nine?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What time is it?&#x201d; I turned to see that the clock read twenty minutes &#x2019;til. I rushed past Mama and up the stairs, saying, &#x201c;I better get my shoes and get out of here!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Please tell me you&#x2019;re wearing your corset,&#x201d; she called. <br>Tootsie was in the upstairs hallway still dressed in her nightgown, hair disheveled, sleep in her eyes. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s all this?&#x201d; <br>When Newman had gone off to France in the fall to fight with General Pershing, Tootsie came back home to live until he returned. &#x201c; <i>If</i> he returns,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said glumly, earning a stern look from Daddy&#x2014;who we all called the Judge, his being an associate Alabama Supreme Court justice. &#x201c;Show some pride,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d scolded Tootsie. &#x201c;No matter the outcome, Newman&#x2019;s service honors the South.&#x201d; And she said, &#x201c;Daddy, it&#x2019;s the twentieth century, for heaven&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d; <br>Now I told her, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m light a layer, according to Her Highness.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Really, Baby, if you go out with no corset, men will think you&#x2019;re&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Immoral?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Maybe I don&#x2019;t care,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s different now anyway. The War Industries Board said not to wear corsets&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They said not to <i>buy</i> them. But that was a good try.&#x201d; She followed me into my bedroom. &#x201c;Even if you don&#x2019;t care about social convention, have a thought for yourself; if the Judge knew you left the house half-naked, he would have your hide.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I was <i>tryin&#x2019;</i> to have a thought for myself,&#x201d; I said, stripping off my blouse, &#x201c;and then all you people butted in.&#x201d; <br>Mama was still in the kitchen when I clattered back down the stairs. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s better. Now the skirt,&#x201d; she said, pointing at my waist. <br>&#x201c;Mama, no. It gets in my way when I run.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Just fix it, please. I can&#x2019;t have you spoiling the Judge&#x2019;s good name just so you can get someplace faster.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s out this early but the help, and anyway, when did you get so fussy?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a matter of what&#x2019;s appropriate. You&#x2019;re seventeen years old&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c; <i>Eight</i>een, in twenty-six more days.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s right, even <i>more</i> to the point,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Too old to still be a tomboy.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Call me a fashion plate, then. Hemlines are goin&#x2019; up, I saw it in <i>McCall&#x2019;s</i>.&#x201d; <br>She pointed at my skirt. &#x201c;Not as high as that.&#x201d; <br>I kissed her on her softening jawline. No cream or powder could hide Time&#x2019;s toll on Mama&#x2019;s features. She&#x2019;d be fifty-seven on her next birthday, and all those years showed in her lined face, her upswept hairdo, her insistence on sticking with her Edwardian shirtwaists and floor-sweeping skirts. She outright refused to make anything new for herself. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a war going on,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say, as if that explained everything. Tootsie and I had been so proud when she gave up her bustle at New Year&#x2019;s. <br>I said, &#x201c;So long, Mama&#x2014;don&#x2019;t wait lunch for me, I&#x2019;m goin&#x2019; to the diner with the girls.&#x201d; <br>Then the second I was out of sight, I sat down in the grass and pulled off my shoes and stockings to free my toes. Too bad, I thought, that my own freedom couldn&#x2019;t be had so easily. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Thunder rumbled in the distance as I headed toward Dexter Avenue, the wide thoroughfare that runs right up to the domed, columned state capitol, the most impressive building I had ever seen. Humming &#x201c;Dance of the Hours,&#x201d; the tune I&#x2019;d perform to later, I skipped along amid the smell of clipped grass and wet moss and sweet, decaying catalpa blooms. <br>Ballet, just then, was my one true love, begun at age nine when Mama had enrolled me in Professor Weisner&#x2019;s School of Dance&#x2014;a failed attempt to keep me out of the trees and off the roofs. In ballet&#x2019;s music and motion there was joy and drama and passion and romance, all the things I desired from life. There were costumes, stories, parts to play, chances to be more than just the littlest Sayre girl&#x2014;last in line, forever wanting to be old enough to be <i>old enough</i>. <br>I was on Mildred Street just past where it intersected with Sayre&#x2014;named for my family, yes&#x2014;when a sprinkle hit my cheek, and then one hit my forehead, and then God turned the faucet on full. I ran for the nearest tree and stood beneath its branches, for what little good it did. The wind whipped the leaves and the rain all around me and I was soaked in no time. Since I couldn&#x2019;t get any wetter, I just went on my way, imagining the trees as a troupe of swaying dancers and me an escaped orphan freed, finally, from a powerful warlock&#x2019;s tyranny. I might be lost in the forest, but as in all the best ballets, a prince was sure to happen along shortly. <br>At the wide circular fountain where Court Street joined Dexter Avenue, I leaned against the railing and shook my unruly hair to get the water out. A few soggy automobiles motored up the boulevard and streetcars clanged past while I considered whether to just chuck my stockings and shoes into the fountain rather than wear them wet. Then I thought, <i>Eighteen, in twenty-six days,</i> and put the damn things back on. <br>Properly clothed, more or less, I went up the street toward the Red Cross&#x2019;s new office, set among the shops on the south side of Dexter. Though the rain was tapering off, the sidewalks were still mostly empty&#x2014;few witnesses to my dishevelment, then, which would make Mama happy. <i>She worries about the oddest things,</i> I thought. <i>All the women do.</i> There were so many rules we girls were supposed to adhere to, so much emphasis on propriety. Straight backs. Gloved hands. Unpainted (and unkissed) lips. Pressed skirts, modest words, downturned eyes, chaste thoughts. A lot of nonsense, in my view. Boys liked me <i>because</i> I shot spitballs and <i>because</i> I told sassy jokes and <i>because</i> I let &#x2019;em kiss me if they smelled nice and I felt like it. My standards were based on good sense, not the logic of lemmings. <i>Sorry, Mama. You&#x2019;re better than most.</i> <br>Some twenty volunteers had gathered at the Red Cross, most of them friends of mine, who, when they saw me, barely raised an eyebrow at my state. Only my oldest sister, Marjorie, who was bustling round with pamphlets and pastries, made a fuss. <br>&#x201c;Baby, what a fright you look! Did you not wear a hat?&#x201d; She attempted to smooth my hair, then gave up, saying, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s hopeless. Here.&#x201d; She handed me a dish towel. &#x201c;Dry off. If we didn&#x2019;t need volunteers so badly, I&#x2019;d send you home.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Quit worryin&#x2019;,&#x201d; I told her, rubbing the towel over my head. <br>She&#x2019;d keep worrying anyway, I knew; she&#x2019;d been fourteen when I was born, practically my second mother until she married and moved into a house two blocks away&#x2014;and by then, of course, the habit was ingrained. I looped the towel around her neck, then went to find a seat. <br>Eleanor Browder, my best friend at the time, had saved me a spot across from her at a long row of tables. To my right was Sara Mayfield&#x2014;Second Sara, we called her, Sara the First being our friend serene Sara Haardt, who now went to college in Baltimore. Second Sara was paired with Livye Hart, whose glossy, mahogany-colored hair was like my friend Tallulah Bankhead&#x2019;s. Tallu and <i>her</i> glossy dark hair won a <i>Picture-Play</i> beauty contest when we were fifteen, and now she was turning that win into a New York City acting career. She and her hair had a life of travel and glamour that I envied, despite my love for Montgomery; surely no one told Tallu how long her skirts should be. <br>Waiting for the meeting to start, we girls fanned ourselves in the airless room. Its high, apricot-colored walls were plastered with Red Cross posters. One showed a wicker basket overflowing with yarn and a pair of knitting needles; it exhorted readers, &#x201c;Our boys need SOX. Knit your bit.&#x201d; Another featured a tremendous stark red cross, to the right of which was a nurse in flowing dress and robes that could not be a bit practical. The nurse&#x2019;s arms cradled an angled stretcher, on which a wounded soldier lay with a dark blanket wrapped around both the stretcher and him. The perspective was such that the nurse appeared to be a giantess&#x2014;and the soldier appeared at risk of sliding from that stretcher, feet first, if the nurse didn&#x2019;t turn her distant gaze to the matter at hand. Below the image was this proclamation: &#x201c;The Greatest Mother in the World.&#x201d; <br>I elbowed Sara and pointed to the poster. &#x201c;What do you reckon? Is she supposed to be the Virgin Mother?&#x201d; <br>Sara didn&#x2019;t get a chance to answer. There was a rapping of a cane on the wooden floor, and we all turned toward stout Mrs. Baker, in her steel-gray, belted suit. She was a formidable woman who&#x2019;d come down from Boston to help instruct the volunteers, a woman who seemed as if she might be able to win the war single-handedly if only someone would put her on a boat to France. <br>&#x201c;Good morning, everyone,&#x201d; she said in her drawl-less, nasal voice. &#x201c;I see you&#x2019;ve found our new location without undue effort. The war continues, and so we must continue&#x2014;indeed, redouble&#x2014;our efforts for membership and productivity.&#x201d; <br>Some of the girls cheered. They were the younger ones who&#x2019;d only just been allowed to join. <br>Mrs. Baker nodded, which made her chin disappear into her neck briefly, and then she continued, &#x201c;Now, some of you have done finger and arm bandages; the principle of the leg and body bandages is the same. However, there are some significant differences to which we must attend. For any who have not been so instructed, I will start the lesson from the beginning. We start, first, with sheets of unbleached calico&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>I squeezed rainwater from my hem while Mrs. Baker lectured about widths and lengths and tension and began a demonstration. She handed the end of a loose strip of fabric to the girl sitting nearest and said, &#x201c;Stand up, my dear. One of you holds the bulk of the fabric and feeds it through as needed&#x2014;that person is the roll <i>ee.</i> The roll <i>er</i>&#x2019;s thumbs must be on the upper aspect of the fabric, the forefinger beneath, like so. As we proceed, the forefingers are kept firmly against the roll, thumbs advanced for maximum tautness. Everyone, up now and begin.&#x201d; <br>I took a loosely tied bundle of fabric from one of several baskets lined up along the floor behind me. The fabric was pure white at the moment, sure, but it would soon be blood-soaked and covering a man&#x2019;s whole middle, crusted with dirt and irresistible to flies. I&#x2019;d seen photographs of Civil War soldiers suffering this way, in books that depicted what Daddy called &#x201c;the atrocities done to us by the Union.&#x201d; <br>It was my brother, Tony, seven years older than me and now serving in France, who Daddy meant to educate with the books and the discussions. He never shooed me out of the parlor, though. He would wave me over from where I might be picking out a simple tune on the piano and let me perch on his knee. <br>&#x201c;The Sayres have a proud history in Montgomery,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say, paging through one of the books. &#x201c;Here. This is my uncle William&#x2019;s original residence, where he raised his younger brother Daniel, your grandfather. It became the first Confederate White House.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So Sayre Street is named for <i>us,</i> Daddy?&#x201d; I asked with all the wonder of my seven or eight years. <br>&#x201c;It honors William and my father. The two of them made this town what it is, children.&#x201d; <br>Tony seemed to take the Sayre family history as a matter of course. I, however, was fascinated with all of these now-dead relatives and would continue to ask questions about which of them had done what, when. I wanted stories. <br>From Daddy, I got tales of how his father, Daniel Sayre, founded a Tuskegee paper, then returned to Montgomery to edit the <i>Montgomery Post,</i> becoming an influential voice in local politics. And Daddy told me about his mother&#x2019;s brother, &#x201c;the great General John Tyler Morgan,&#x201d; who&#x2019;d pummeled Union troops every chance he got, then later became a prominent U.S. Senator. From Mama I came to know her father, Willis Machen, the U.S. Senator from Kentucky, whose friendship with Senator Morgan was responsible for my parents&#x2019; meeting at Senator Morgan&#x2019;s New Year&#x2019;s Eve ball in 1883. Grandfather Machen had once been a presidential candidate. <br>I wondered, that day at the Red Cross, if our family&#x2019;s history was burdensome to Tony, oppressive, maybe. And maybe that was why he&#x2019;d married Edith, whose people were tenant farmers, and then left Montgomery to live and work in Mobile. To be the only surviving son in a family&#x2014;and not the first son, not the son who&#x2019;d be...</p><h2>The Tao of Warren Buffett: Warren Buffett&#39;s Words of Wisdom: Quotations and Interpretations to Help Guide You to Billionaire Wealth and Enlightened Business Management</h2><p>A collection of pithy and inspiring sayings from America's favorite businessman that reveal his secrets of success.<br><br>Like the sayings of the ancient Chinese philospher Lao-tzu, Warren Buffett's worldly wisdom is deceptively simple and enormously powerful in application.

The printing quality of this copy will vary from the original offset printing edition and may look more saturated. The information presented in this version is the same as the latest edition. Any pattern pullouts have been separated and presented as single pages. If the pullout patterns are missing, please contact c&amp;t publishing.</p><p>More than just a dollmaking book, <i>Anatomy of a Doll</i> provides a fascinating overview of the creative process that has gone into dollmaking for centuries. With nearly 300 excellent photographs of her own dolls and those of many other accomplished artists, noted doll expert Susanna Oroyan offers instructions and ideas for a tremendous variety of cloth dolls. Separate chapters are devoted to the head, the body (including hands and feet), body joints, assemblies, and finishing details. There is enough practical information on all aspects of basic techniques to help the novice dollmaker, and even experts will discover an abundance of new ideas. Everyone will marvel at the unbounded creativity reflected in these remarkable figures.Dollmaker Susanna Oroyan has made some 500 original dolls. Her book shows in color the diverse work of 100 and more contemporary artist-dollmakers. Like any sensible philosopher, she delays defining a doll for quite a few pages. "I am sure ... I don't know what a doll is. It seems to be a representation of the human figure." <p>One of the author's own dolls, "Angel," is an 18-inch tangle of airily gleaming wire around a copper chest plate and a solid white head, hands and feet. Another artist has built a colloquy between two life-size half-figures seated at a table covered with real books on the arts. They face each other against a painted, glowering sky, as each points a stylish finger at the other. A third artist has made a far simpler pair of seven-inch "Star Ladies," each a stuffed piece of painted cloth, in five-pointed, hair-flying star shape, all points so artfully extended and curved that the illusion of comic flight is intense. </p><p>How would you write an anatomy textbook for so complex an art? This is one. It begins with graded study of the fundamentals--scale, materials, colors, joints, faces. Line drawings show how legs, for instance, can be made to suggest the true complex form. Molding of plastic media; needle sculpture by multiple piercing and tautening a stuffed cloth head; body joints by stitching, tying, hinging, ball-and-socket; wire armatures; draped clothing--all strive to approximate the living body. This is not the place for mere patterns but for a choice of resources presented to the reader, open to the needs of both beginners and experts. Using ordinary cloth, threads, buttons, yarn, one of us has been caught in this net, finding her way to small portraits of character. Your male reviewer has made no dolls yet but has enjoyed this book as a peerless museum guide, as a user's manual of the inventive hand and mind, and as a parable of science. High school needleworkers, artists and their teachers who use Oroyan will soon concur. </p><p>In sum, the best learning is doing; feedback from failure is often the path to success; take time and path to suit yourself--but the act of creation is often messy! Success is not won simply by whim...</p></p><h2>Connecting the Dots: Lessons for Leadership in a Startup World</h2><p><b>Silicon Valley visionary John Chambers shares the lessons that transformed a dyslexic kid from West Virginia into one of the world's best business leaders and turned a simple router company into a global tech titan.</b><br><b></b><br> When Chambers joined Cisco in 1991, it was a company with 400 employees, a single product, and about $70 million in revenue. When he stepped down as CEO in 2015, he left a $47 billion tech giant that was the backbone of the internet and a leader in areas from cybersecurity to data center convergence. Along the way, he had acquired 180 companies and turned more than 10,000 employees into millionaires. Widely recognized as an innovator, an industry leader, and one of the world's best CEOs, Chambers has outlasted and outmaneuvered practically every rival that ever tried to take Cisco on--Nortel, Lucent, Alcatel, IBM, Dell, and Hewlett-Packard, to name a few.<br><br> Now Chambers is sharing his unique strategies for winning in a digital world. From his early lessons and struggles with dyslexia in West Virginia to his bold bets and battles with some of the biggest names in tech, Chambers gives readers a playbook on how to act before the market shifts, tap customers for strategy, partner for growth, build teams, and disrupt themselves. He also adapted those lessons to transform government, helping global leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to create new models for growth. <br><br>As CEO of JC2 Ventures, he's now investing in a new generation of game-changing startups by helping founders become great leaders and scale their companies. <br><br><i>Connecting the Dots </i>is destined to become a business classic, providing hard-won insights and critical tools to thrive during the accelerating disruption of the digital age.<br></p><p><b>John Chambers</b>, chairman emeritus at Cisco, served as the company's CEO for more than two decades.

In the 1930s he was predicting ecological catastrophe when no-one else could see it coming. He foresaw: Global warming and its devastating consequences, increasing violence and lawlessness as the direct result of destructive methods which block Nature&#39;s energies and balance. The destruction of the world&#39;s forests and ecosystems. This, and the fact that he developed free energy machines through harnessing the magical processes of Nature, has made Viktor Schauberger truly a man of our times. Nature as Teacher details Schauberger&#39;s thinking about environmental catastrophe. It includes correspondence with contemporaries and, in particular, his feelings of frustration at the blindness of those in mainstream science who seemed to him to be more concerned with their own welfare and pride than with the fate of humanity. This volume gives tremendous insight into what is happening on the Earth today and presents practical solutions on how we may yet save our precious world.</p><p>Viktor Schauberger (1885-1958) came from a long line of forest custodians. An Austrian naturalist, philosopher and inventor, his extraordinary understanding of the workings of nature derived from his keen powers of observation in the forest where he worked. Callum Coats is the author of Living Energies, the standard work of reference on Viktor Schauberger&#39;s ideas and studied with Schauberger&#39;s son, Walter, in Austria.</p><h2>Lockwood &amp; Co.: The Hollow Boy (Lockwood &amp; Co., 3)</h2><p>As a massive outbreak of supernatural Visitors baffles Scotland Yard and causes protests throughout London, Lockwood &amp; Co. continue to demonstrate their effectiveness in exterminating spirits.

There is a new spirit of openness in the team now that Lockwood has shared some of his childhood secrets, and Lucy is feeling more and more as if her true home is at Portland Row. It comes as a great shock, then, when Lockwood and George introduce her to an annoyingly perky and hyper-efficient new assistant, Holly Munro.<br><br>Meanwhile, there are reports of many new hauntings, including a house where bloody footprints are appearing, and a department store full of strange sounds and shadowy figures.

The public hunger for the paranormal seems insatiable. Paranormal America provides the definitive portrait of Americans who believe in or have experienced such phenomena as ghosts, Bigfoot, UFOs, psychic phenomena, astrology, and the power of mediums. However, unlike many books on the paranormal, this volume does not focus on proving or disproving the paranormal, but rather on understanding the people who believe and how those beliefs shape their lives. Drawing on the Baylor Religion Survey a multi-year national random sample of American religious values, practices, and behaviors as well as extensive fieldwork including joining hunts for Bigfoot and spending the night in a haunted house, authors Christopher Bader, F. Carson Mencken, and Joseph Baker shed light on what the various types of paranormal experiences, beliefs, and activities claimed by Americans are; whether holding an unconventional belief, such as believing in Bigfoot, means that one is unconventional in other attitudes and behaviors; who has such experiences and beliefs and how they differ from other Americans; and if we can expect major religions to emerge from the paranormal. Brimming with engaging personal stories and provocative findings, Paranormal America is an entertaining yet authoritative look at a growing segment of American religious culture.</p><p><p><strong>Christopher D.

The TV black. The room dark. The pinging of the e-mails silenced. I am focused on nothing else but this glowing computer screen, the blinking cursor, and the words appearing in Helvetica twelve-point font.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m not paying attention to the honking taxis on the street, or the clanking drum solo of my radiator. I&#x2019;m certainly not paying attention to my two-year-old son, Zane, who is outside my office door, apparently doing an impression of Fran Drescher impersonating Alvin the Chipmunk.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m trying to do this because I realize I have a problem focusing. My brain is all over the place.<br> <br>Consider this: multitasking almost killed me. Maybe I&#x2019;m being melodramatic here. You be the judge. Two years ago, Julie and I were driving a rented Taurus to my cousin&#x2019;s wedding in Woodstock, New York. The kids were at home with our babysitter, Michelle.<br> <br>I was at the wheel, weaving my way north, listening to the audio book we&#x2019;d brought along: the biography of Albert Einstein by Walter Isaacson. It&#x2019;s a good book. Dangerously good.<br> <br><i>Interesting,</i> I thought to myself, as we listened to chapter 8. When Einstein was a clerk at the patent office, he did a lot of work on clocks that were synchronized at the speed of light, which led to his early ideas on relativity. His day job was crucial. If he&#x2019;d been a regular old tenured professor, we might not have relativity and our kids would be watching videos called <i>Baby Heisenberg</i>.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m not a fan of driving. I know a lot of people get a dopamine rush from steering a powerful steel machine down a road. I&#x2019;ve seen the postcoitally blissful faces of men in Honda commercials. But for me, driving holds all the allure of operating an electric can opener. In other words, I found the life of the world&#x2019;s greatest scientist more intriguing than the Saw Mill River Parkway.<br> <br>My mind drifted from the road. The car drifted from the road. Julie screamed.<br> <br>I snapped my attention back to the highway and jammed the steering wheel hard to the left. Tires squealed. An overcorrection. Now to the right. We serpentined for a few seconds, then hit the shoulder and launched into space. We jumped a waist-high concrete median and bounced down ass-backward into oncoming traffic on the other side of the highway. A &#x201c;real <i>Dukes of Hazzard</i>&#x201d; move, as the tow truck driver later described it. If only Julie had been wearing jean shorts.<br> <br>We sat for a few seconds in our rental car, the bottom ripped off, the hood crinkled. For reasons only weird Einsteinian physics can explain, no other cars smashed into us. I was relieved to still be breathing. Julie was crying&#x2014;somewhat relieved, but mostly furious at me for losing control. The rest of the afternoon consisted of cops, rental car insurance forms, rubberneckers, and strained silence. We were three hours late for the wedding.<br> <br>Julie has since banned me from all driving except in parking lots and cul-de-sacs. On road trips out of New York, I get to sit in the back and negotiate peace treaties about which Nickelodeon movie we&#x2019;re going to put in the portable DVD player. That may seem like it&#x2019;s emasculating, but is just fine with me. I know I&#x2019;m a terrible driver.<br> <br>My near-death experience put an end, at least for now, to my driving career. But it didn&#x2019;t put a speed bump in my multitasking habits. Not a bit. Unless I&#x2019;m doing at least two things at once, I feel like I&#x2019;m wasting my time. Phone and e-mail. Watching <i>The Office,</i> checking Facebook, and reading the <i>Times</i> op-eds online. Texting and peeing.<br> <br>My friend Andy taught me how to read-walk. He could read an entire <i>Newsweek</i> magazine on his walk from the subway to his apartment. Just be sure to glance up once every paragraph or two, he told me.<br> <br>I recently read a quote from actress Jennifer Connelly in <i>The Atlantic:</i> &#x201c;I do like to read a book while having sex. And talk on the phone. You can get so much done.&#x201d; Julie would never go for that. But I do remember a girlfriend who allowed <i>Law &amp; Order</i> to play in the background, which made for some efficient, suspense-filled romance, with a plot twist at 10:41 P.M.<br> <br>In one sense, task-juggling makes me feel great: busy, energized, fulfilled, like I&#x2019;m living three lives in the space of one.<br> <br>But I also know I&#x2019;m scattered. I&#x2019;m overloading my circuits. I know, deep down, this overstimulated, underfocused world is driving us all batty. My mom&#x2014;who complains when I click through my e-mails while talking to her on the phone (and by talking, I mean that I toss out an occasional &#x201c;uh-huh,&#x201d; and &#x201c;sounds good&#x201d;)&#x2014;recently sent me a <i>Times</i> article about how multitasking is actually inefficient.<br> <br>Hence Operation Focus. I&#x2019;m going to recapture my attention span, which currently can be measured only by one of those atomic clocks. I pledge to go cold turkey from multitasking for a month. Only single tasks. Unitasking. And just as important, I&#x2019;ll stick with each task for more than my average thirty seconds. I&#x2019;ll be the most focused man in the world.<br> <b>THE PREPARATION</b><p></p> <br>I collected a shelfful of books on attention. I won&#x2019;t even mention how hard it was to focus on them. (Note to William James: I love you, but easy on the dependent clauses, please!)<br> <br>What I took away was this: when I said multitasking is a life-or-death problem, I wasn&#x2019;t exaggerating. And not just because Driving Under the Influence of Text Messaging causes 630,000 crashes a year. The stakes are even higher. We&#x2019;re talking survival of civilization itself&#x2014;at least if you believe some of these writers. Author Maggie Jackson wrote an intriguing and frightening book called <i>Distracted: The Erosion of Attention and the Coming Dark Age</i>.<br> <br>Okay, maybe &#x201c;Dark Age&#x201d; is a tad alarmist. I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;re going to stop reading books and start waging religious wars. Umm, let me rephrase. Let&#x2019;s just say I think &#x201c;Dark Age&#x201d; might be an overstatement. But the gist of Jackson&#x2019;s book is right. The culture of distraction is changing the way we think. It&#x2019;s rewiring our brains. It&#x2019;s making it harder for us to solve complex problems. Nicholas Carr writes in <i>The Atlantic</i> in an article called &#x201c;Is Google Making Us Stupid?&#x201d; (hint: yes), &#x201c;Once I was a scuba diver in the sea of words. Now I zip along the surface like a guy on a Jet-Ski.&#x201d;<br> <br>Our hopscotching brains make us more depressed (it&#x2019;s harder to focus on the positive), less able to connect with people and form a conscience. And our attention spans are to blame for America&#x2019;s dismal math skills. Malcolm Gladwell points out in <i>Outliers</i> that Japanese kids stick with a hard math problem for fourteen minutes, while American kids give up after 9.5 minutes.<br> <br>Oh, and it&#x2019;s all an insane delusion, to boot. Multitasking makes us feel efficient. But my mom is right: it actually just slows our thinking down. In fact, <i>multitasking</i> is the wrong word. Our brains can&#x2019;t handle more than one higher cognitive function at a time. We may think we&#x2019;re multitasking, but we&#x2019;re actually switchtasking. Toggling between one task and another. First the phone, then the e-mail, then the phone, back to the e-mail. And each time you switch, there&#x2019;s a few milliseconds of startup cost. The neurons need time to rev up.<br> <br>Multitasking costs the economy $650 billion a year, according to the Institute of Pulling Numbers Out of Its Ass. (That&#x2019;s a real estimate, though not the institute&#x2019;s real name.) Whatever the actual total is, I&#x2019;m starting to think this isn&#x2019;t a problem along the lines of love handles or bad cell service. This is the Eleventh Plague.<br> <b>THE START</b><p></p> <br>Today is my first day without multitasking. When I get up, I take a shower. That&#x2019;s it. No NPR on the shower radio. It&#x2019;s weirdly quiet, just the sound of water splashing into the tub.<br> <br>Embrace the stillness, I say to myself. Feel the water on my face. Experience it. Be present. Be mindful.<br> <br>My brain is not cooperating. <i>What the hell is going on?</i> it whines. It sounds a lot like my kids in the backseat demanding a Berenstain Bears DVD. <i>Where&#x2019;s my damn stimulation?</i><br> <br>I sit at my desk and read the newspaper. That&#x2019;s all. Without checking my e-mails or eating breakfast at the same time. Simply flipping the pages.<br> <br>This is awful. I feel like my brain has entered a school zone and has to slow down to 25 mph.<br> <br>My plan is to leave my BlackBerry off till noon. I break down at eleven-thirty.<br> <br>At lunchtime, Julie and I are in the kitchen.<br> <br>&#x201c;Somehow the liquid soap in the bathroom dispenser disappeared,&#x201d; she says.<br> <br><i>I stop what I&#x2019;m doing&#x2014;making a peanut butter and raspberry jam sandwich&#x2014;and look at her. Must unitask.</i><br> <br>&#x201c;So I filled it up with soap from the kitchen. And I was washing my hands with it, and it smelled weird.&#x201d;<br> <br><i>I&#x2019;m watching her face. Maybe staring too much. That reminds me. I have to call the Fox publicist about their new show on reading people&#x2019;s faces. Focus, Jacobs!</i><br> <br>&#x201c;It smelled...industrial. And I realized I had used dishwasher liquid instead of regular soap.&#x201d;<br> <br><i>It&#x2019;s not that the topic isn&#x2019;t interesting. As someone obsessed with handwashing, this is actually relevant stuff. It&#x2019;s just that I&#x2019;m usually doing something else during a conversation. Picking up stray cups, or putting away sweaters.</i><br> <br>&#x201c;So I bring it back to the kitchen because I don&#x2019;t want to waste it, and I&#x2019;m cleaning the coffee pot. . .&#x201d;<br> <br><i>Keep looking at the face. You know, I&#x2019;ve always fantasized about inventing contact lenses with tiny TVs embedded in them. You could be looking straight at your coworker as he tells you about his trip to Knott&#x2019;s Berry Farm, but little does he know, on the inside of your contact lens, you&#x2019;re enjoying</i> CSI: Miami. <i>Just remember to nod occasionally.</i><br> <br>&#x201c;. . . and the suds won&#x2019;t go away. I had to wash the coffee pot for five minutes.&#x201d;<br> <br><i>Or braille. I&#x2019;d always wanted to learn braille. That way I could be having lunch with my boss, making polite noises, while </i><i>my fingertips read the latest Andrew Jackson biography underneath the table.</i><br> <br>&#x201c;And the coffee still tasted soapy,&#x201d; says Julie.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why are you writing that down?&#x201d; she asks.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s for a project.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is everything I say fodder?&#x201d;<br> <br>I shrugged.<br> <br>She makes a pouty face. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not just a character.&#x201d;<br> <b>THE DECLINE AND FALL OF WESTERN ATTENTION</b><p></p> <br>Baboons have a better attention span than I do. This is true. My favorite theory about attention comes from a baboon study. Male baboons, it argues, evolved attention partly so that they could guard the female baboon for a good long time after sex, to make sure no one else conducted any monkey business that might interfere with their sperm. (My question: If this is true, why are men so opposed to cuddling?)<br> <br>However it started, attention had a decent run in humans for a couple of millennia there. In the book <i>Distracted,</i> I read about &#x201c;attention athletes&#x201d; such as eighteenth-century Swiss entomologist Charles Bonnet, who &#x201c;studied a single aphid from 5:30 A.M. to 11 P.M. for twenty-one days straight in order to learn about its reproductive cycle.&#x201d; That guy is my new hero.<br> <br>Oh to be born in the golden age of attention. When Lincoln and Douglas could have three-hour debates, or the faithful could pray without ceasing for four hours. When people would look at a painting for an afternoon. Paintings! They&#x2019;re like TV, but they don&#x2019;t move.<br> <br>Then it all broke down. The Industrial Revolution came. We began to fetishize speed and equate quickness with intelligence. We bought into the myth that, as writer Walter Kirn puts it, nonstop connectedness equals freedom. We started to chop everything down into component parts. And worship at the altar of Frederick Taylor and other efficiency experts with clipboards and stopwatches.<br> <br>I used to be proud of my attention deficit. Or at least I pretended to be proud. Focusing on only one thing for a long time? That went out of style with snuff boxes. I&#x2019;m part of a new generation, <i>man</i>.<br> <br>I loved to Jet-Ski across the surface. Even when I read the encyclopedia&#x2014;my longest attempt at sustained focus&#x2014;it actually fed right into my ADD personality. Each essay is a bite-size nugget. Bored with Abilene, Texas? Here comes abolitionism. Tired of that? Not to worry, the Abominable Snowman&#x2019;s lurking right around the corner.<br> <br>I still think it&#x2019;s got its advantages. It helped me when I chose articles for <i>Esquire.</i> As an editor, if a story grabbed me, I knew it had to be interesting, since my brain was tugged in forty-two directions.<br> <br>The first hint I was missing something came during my biblical year. The Sabbath&#x2014;which I still try to practice&#x2014;taught me the value of stillness.<br> <br>The science drove it home. In another excellent antimultitasking article in <i>The Atlantic</i> (that magazine is all over this beat!), Kirn explains the problem with frightening clarity. Multitasking shortchanges the higher regions of the brain, the ones devoted to learning and memory.<br> <br>Kirn describes a recent UCLA study:<br> <br>[R]esearchers asked a group of 20-somethings to sort index cards in two trials, once in silence and once while simultaneously listening for specific tones in a series of randomly presented sounds.<br> <br>The subjects sorted the cards just as successfully in both trials. But here&#x2019;s the key: when they had the distracting tones in the background, they had a much more difficult time remembering what they were sorting.<br> <br>It comes down to the brain&#x2019;s real estate: &#x201c;The subjects&#x2019; brains coped with the additional task by shifting responsibility from the hippocampus&#x2014;which stores and recalls information&#x2014;to the striatum, which takes care of rote, repetitive activities.&#x201d;<br> <br>And speaking of the brain, Kirn writes: &#x201c;Even worse, certain studies find that multitasking boosts the level of stress-related hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline and wears down our systems through biochemical friction, prematurely aging us. In the short term, the confusion, fatigue, and chaos merely hamper our ability to focus and analyze, but in the long term, they may cause it to atrophy.&#x201d;<br> <br>In short, multitasking rots your skull.<br> <br>Of course, not all multitasking is created equal. It helps if one of the tasks requires less intellectual wattage. If you&#x2019;re mopping the floor while talking on the phone, it&#x2019;s a lot better than texting while on the phone. But even with the mopping, you&#x2019;re eating away at attention. Your conversation will suffer, if only mildly.<br> <b>THE ODYSSEUS STRATEGY</b><p></p> <br>I&#x2019;ve got to do something about my desk.

You will see how Vicka and Jokov actually experienced the reality of life beyond this world, and what happened when Our Lady took them with her on the most extraordinary journey to Heaven, Purgatory and Hell. Sister Emmanuel writes about this book: &#34;It is an adventure story, except that this story is true and is happening right now for you!&#34;</p><p>Sister Emmanuel tells that after receiving her first calling to the Beatitudes Community in 1976, she received another calling-to serve Our Lady in Medjugorje. Sent by her community, she initiated the first branch of the community in Medjugorje in 1989. During the Balkan war in the 90s, Sister Emmanuel became known for her regular faxes about the situation in Herzegovina, always related to the mission of Our Lady. She has had an enormous impact on France, stimulating an extensive response to Medjugorje among French pilgrims, but her apostolate has broadened as her books have been translated into 22 languages and she has traveled widely to make Medjugorje known, particularly in the United States. Today, \&#34;Les Enfants de Medjugorje\&#34; and \&#34;Children of Medjugorje, Inc.\&#34; allow her to be connected everyday to thousands of people around the world, who are motivated by and spreading, the messages of Our Lady in their own humble way. Sister says that her greatest joy is to be part of a family formed by Our Lady, and being Her extended heart and hands for her children, especially those who do not yet know the love of God.</p><h2>The Discovery of the Mind</h2><p>"An illuminating and convincing account of the enormous change in the whole conception of morals and human personality which took place during the centuries covered by Homer, the early lyric poets, the dramatists, and Socrates." &#x2014; <i>The Times </i>(London)<i> Literary Supplement.<br></i>European thinking began with the Greeks. Science, literature, ethics, philosophy &#x2014; all had their roots in the extraordinary civilization that graced the shores of the Mediterranean a few millennia ago. The rise of thinking among the Greeks was nothing less than a revolution; they did not simply map out new areas for thought and discussion, they literally created the idea of man as an intellectual being &#x2014; an unprecedented concept that decisively influenced the subsequent evolution of European thought.<br>In this immensely erudite book, German classicist Bruno Snell traces the establishment of a rational view of the nature of man as evidenced in the literature of the Greeks &#x2014; in the creations of epic and lyric poetry, and in the drama. Here are the crucial stages in the intellectual evolution of the Greek world: the Homeric world view, the rise of the individual in the early Greek lyric, myth and reality in Greek tragedy, Greek ethics, the origin of scientific thought, and Arcadia.<br>Drawing extensively on the works of Homer, Pindar, Archilochus, Aristophanes, Sappho, Heraclitus, the Greek tragedians, Parmenides, Callimachus, and a host of other writers and thinkers, Snell shows how the Homeric myths provided a blueprint for the intellectual structure the Greeks erected; how the notion of universality in Greek tragedy broadened into philosophical generalization; how the gradual unfolding of the concepts of intellect and soul provided the foundation for philosophy, science, ethics, and finally, religion.<br>Unquestionably one of the monuments of the Geistegeschichte (History of Ideas) tradition, <i>The Discovery of the Mind </i>throws fresh light on many long-standing problems and has had a wide influence on scholars of the Greek intellectual tradition. Closely reasoned, replete with illuminating insight, the book epitomizes the best in German classical scholarship &#x2014; a brilliant exploration of the archetypes of Western thought; a penetrating explanation of how we came to think the way we do.</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>The Works of Josephus</h2><p><p>This renowned reference book has served scholars, pastors, students, and those interested in the background of the New Testament for years.

The outlook of Josephus, a late first century Pharisee and historian, on Jesus and the New Testament documents is enlightening and provocative.

It seems easier to classify them by what they don't want, namely, the organizations of the State, and to identify them with rioting and protest rather than with any coherent ideology. But with demonstrations like those against the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund being blamed on anarchists, it is clear that an explanation of what they do stand for is long overdue. <br><br>Colin Ward provides answers to these questions by considering anarchism from a variety of perspectives: theoretical, historical, and international, and by exploring key anarchist thinkers, from Kropotkin to Chomsky. He looks critically at anarchism by evaluating key ideas within it, such as its blanket opposition to incarceration, and policy of "no compromise" with the apparatus of political decision-making. Can anarchy ever function effectively as a political force? Is it more "organized" and "reasonable" than is currently perceived? Whatever the politics of the reader, Ward's argument ensures that anarchism will be much better understood after experiencing this book.<br></p><p><br><strong>Colin Ward</strong> is former editor of <em>Anarchy</em>.

Since learning of your long awaited study of coast-to-coast sex in America,&#x201d; the letter began, I feel I have important information that I could contribute to its contents or to contents of a future book.&#x201d; The man went on to tell Talese an astonishing secret, that he had bought a motel to satisfy his voyeuristic desires.

But because Foos insisted on remaining anonymous, Talese filed his reporting away, assuming the story would remain untold. Now, after thirty-five years, he&#x2019;s ready to go public and Talese can finally tell his story. <i>The Voyeur&#x2019;s Motel</i> is an extraordinary work of narrative journalism, and one of the most talked about books of the year.</p><p><b>Gay Talese</b> was born in Ocean City, New Jersey, in 1932, to Italian immigrant parents.

The result is <b>Lemon Swamp</b>, Mamie Garvin Fields' memories of her childhood and her life as an educated black woman in early twentieth-century Charleston, South Carolina. Born in 1888, Mamie Fields was part of an extended family and a large neighborhood. Keeping track of all the names and places makes the early chapters hard work, but there's a reason for the details, and almost every one has a story. Mamie Fields tells of Charleston parks where blacks were not allowed to sit on the benches, and describes jubilant picnics in the country, filled with food, families, dancing, and hide-and-go-seek. There is her grandfather's plantation, with its Lemon Swamp, where her grandmother was "lost" during Sherman's march. And there are the schools on the Sea Islands - "a place behind God's back" - where Mamie Fields taught. In <b>Lemon Swamp</b>, Mamie Fields remembers what blacks were not allowed to do in the South and won't let anybody forget what they accomplished. When other teachers told her "'Don't bother with the white people to get necessities for your school'...[her] attitude was 'He's a man and he speaks English. I will ask him.' " She did ask and she did accomplish - often without asking. She's a remarkable woman, and together she and her granddaughter bring a remarkable history to life. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Erica Bauermeister</i></p><h2>Storyteller&#39;s Word a Day: 180 Words to Take Your Storytelling to the Next Level</h2><p><b><i>Every day, flip the page and discover a new, hilariously illustrated word that will take your child's storytelling to the next level.</i></b><br><br><i>Storyteller's Word a Day</i> is packed with discerning data and insight on how to get the most out of every word.

During the funeral of famous art dealer Georg Khalkis, the metal box containing his last will and testament had vanished from the library safe.

Utterly lacking in rhetoric or dogma, this manual relies instead on bare fact, frank description, and a spare question-and-answer format. Hedges allows U.S. military documentation of the brutalizing physical and psychological consequences of combat to speak for itself. <br><br> Hedges poses dozens of questions that young soldiers might ask about combat, and then answers them by quoting from medical and psychological studies. <br> � What are my chances of being wounded or killed if we go to war? <br> � What does it feel like to get shot? <br> � What do artillery shells do to you? <br> � What is the most painful way to get wounded? <br> � Will I be afraid? <br> � What could happen to me in a nuclear attack? <br> � What does it feel like to kill someone? <br> � Can I withstand torture? <br> � What are the long-term consequences of combat stress? <br> � What will happen to my body after I die? <br><br> This profound and devastating portrayal of the horrors to which we subject our armed forces stands as a ringing indictment of the glorification of war and the concealment of its barbarity.</p><p>Chris Hedges is a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist who was a foreign correspondent for fifteen years for <i>The New York Times,&nbsp;</i>where he served as the Middle East Bureau Chief and Balkan Bureau Chief for the paper.

Estimates for the total number killed in wars throughout all of human history range from 150 million to 1 billion. War has several other effects on population, including decreasing the birthrate by taking men away from their wives. The reduced birthrate during World War II is estimated to have caused a population deficit of more than 20 million people.<br><br><b>How many people around the world serve in the military?</b><br><br>The combined armed forces of the world have 21.3 million people. China has the world's largest, with 2.4 million. America is second with 1.4 million. India has 1.3 million, North Korea 1 million, and Russia 900,000. Of the world's 20 largest militaries, 14 are in developing nations.<br><br><b>How many wars are taking place right now?</b><br><br>At the beginning of 2003 there were 30 wars going on around the world. These included conflicts in Afghanistan, Algeria, Burundi, China, Colombia, the Congo, India, Indonesia, Israel, Iraq, Liberia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Somalia, Sudan, and Uganda.<br><br><b>Is there a genetic reason why we fight?</b><br><br>There is no single "war gene." Combinations of genes can predispose a person to violence. However, aggression is a product of biology and environment. In America, sources of aggressive dispositions include domestic violence, the portrayal of violence in the media, threats from enemies, and combat training.<br><br><b>Is war essentially male?</b><br><br>Worldwide, 97 percent of today's military personnel are male. This is thought to be a reflection of culture and biology. Fifteen percent (204,000) of American military personnel are female.<br><br><b>Can women fight as effectively as men do?</b><br><br>Yes. While fewer women are "natural killers," and women are on average smaller than men, there are many women who have the psychological makeup and the physical ability to fight. There are many men without either. Women have shown valor in combat. Dr. Mary Walker won the Medal of Honor during the Civil War.<br><br><b>Why are civilians so attracted to war?</b><br><br>War is often regarded by observers as honorable and noble. It can be viewed as a contest between nations, a chance to compete and be declared the victor.<br><br><b>Does the American public support war?</b><br><br>Between 65 and 85 percent of the American public will support a military action when it begins. Vietnam had 64 percent support in 1965. As American casualties mount, support often decreases. The Korean and Vietnam Wars ended with support levels near 30 percent. World War II support levels never fell below 77 percent, despite the prolonged and damaging nature of the conflict. The Gulf War enjoyed similar levels of support.<br><br><b>How large is the American military?</b><br><br>The active peacetime force of the U.S. armed services includes 1.4 million people, with the Army making up almost 500,000 of that number. The Navy has approximately 380,000 men and women on active duty. The Air Force has approximately 365,000, and the Marines have approximately 175,000. Approximately 1.3 million Americans serve in Reserve and National Guard branches that can be activated in time of war.<br><br><b>How many Americans have died in wars?</b><br><br>More than 650,000 Americans have been killed in combat. Another 243,000 have died while wars were being fought, due to training accidents, injury, and disease. In the twentieth century, approximately 53,000 Americans were killed in combat in World War I, 291,000 in World War II, 33,000 in the Korean War, 47,000 in Vietnam, and 148 in the Gulf War. Including deaths from disease, accidents, and other factors, each war's total was much higher: approximately 116,000 died in World War I, 400,000 in World War II, 53,000 in the Korean War, 90,000 in Vietnam, and almost 400 in the Gulf War.<br><br><b>How deadly is the American military?</b><br><br>It is difficult to measure how many enemy deaths American armed forces have inflicted. Americans and their allies typically cause 10 to 20 times more combat casualties than American forces suffer. Estimates of Iraqi soldiers killed in the Gulf War range from 1,500 to 100,000. The lowest figure would still be 10 times the number of Americans killed in the war. Approximately 850,000 Vietcong died in the Vietnam War, 18 times the 47,000 U.S. dead. More than 600,000 North Korean and 1 million Chinese fighters died in the Korean War, almost 50 times the 33,000 American dead. In World War II, 3,250,000 German and 1,507,000 Japanese soldiers, sailors, and pilots were killed, 16 times the 291,000 American servicemen who were killed.<br><br><b>How much does it cost the United States to maintain its armed forces?</b><br><br>Since 1975, America has spent between 3 and 6 percent of its gross domestic product on national defense, or approximately 15 to 30 percent of each year's federal budget. In the first years of the twenty-first century, this meant spending roughly $350 billion per year. In comparison, annual spending for other programs included roughly $15 billion on state and international assistance and $60 billion on education. From 1940 to 1996 (a period that includes several cycles of war and peace, including the arms race of the cold war), America spent $16.23 trillion on the military ($5.82 trillion of that on nuclear weapons), versus $1.70 trillion on health care and $1.24 trillion on international affairs.<br><br><b>How much does war cost?</b><br><br>The cost of the Gulf War was approximately $76 billion.* Vietnam cost $500 billion; the Korean War, $336 billion; and World War II, almost $3 trillion. Put another way, the Gulf War cost each person in the United States $306; Vietnam, $2,204 per person; Korea, $2,266 per person; and World War II, $20,388 per person. At its outset, estimates for the cost of the Iraqi War were $50 to $140 billion, and an additional $75 to $500 billion for occupation and peacekeeping, or from $444 to $2,274 per person.<br><br><b>How big is the military industry in the United States?</b><br><br>Besides the 1.4 million active duty personnel, the military employs 627,000 civilians. The defense industry employs another 3 million. In total, the military and its supporting manufacturing base employs 3.5 percent of the U.S. labor force. In 2002, the Department of Defense spent $170.8 billion with military contractors such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin.<br><br><b>How has the size of the industry changed over time?</b><br><br>The 2003 level of 3.5 percent of the labor force is historically low. In 1987, toward the end of the cold war, defense (including the military) made up 5.7 percent of the U.S. labor market; in 1968, during Vietnam, 9.8 percent; in 1943, during World War II, 39 percent. After World War II, defense employment dropped to 4.5 percent, but jumped back to 11 percent in 1951 with the Korean War and the start of the cold war.<br><br><b>Does the military industry help make defense spending decisions? </b><br><br>Yes. In 2000, defense lobbying groups spent approximately $60 million. Defense political action committees also contribute roughly $14 million per congressional election cycle. Defense aerospace, defense electronics, and miscellaneous defense are the 31st-, 44th-, and 46th-ranking industries, respectively.<br><br><b>How many weapons does the U.S. military industry export each year?</b><br><br>In 2001, U.S. arms manufacturers exported $9.7 billion in weapons worldwide. The United Kingdom was second in international exports with $4 billion. In addition, the United States made new sales of $12.1 billion. Russia was second with $5.8 billion. The United States is the world's largest arms manufacturer, supplying almost half of all the arms sold on the world market.<br><br><b>What kinds of arms does the United States export?</b><br><br>In 2002, U.S. manufacturers planned to export arms including Cobra and Apache attack helicopters, Black Hawk helicopters, KC-135A Stratotanker air-to-air tanker/transport aircraft, Hellfire and Hellfire II air-to-surface antiarmor missiles, Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, TOW 2A and 2B missiles, M-16 rifles, M-60 machine guns, grenade launchers, MK-82 (500 lb.) and MK-83 (1,000 lb.) bombs, Sentinel radar systems, GBU-12 Paveway series laser-guided bombs, standard assault amphibious personnel vehicles, assault amphibious command vehicles, and CBU-97 sensor fused weapon antitank cluster bombs.<br><br><b>How many of the weapons U.S. companies export go to developing countries?</b><br><br>Approximately half. From 1994 to 2001, the United States exported $131 billion in arms, with $59 billion going to developing nations. The United States is the leading exporter to developing countries, with Russia and France second and third.<br><br><b>How do American arms exports affect the American people?</b><br><br>Arms exports are an important source of American jobs and help maintain U.S. military manufacturing capacity. They also have some negative consequences. When American weapons are used in a conflict -- for example, by Israel against the Palestinians -- America is also blamed for the attacks. U.S. forces regularly find themselves up against sophisticated weaponry of American origin, which is harder to defend against.<br><br><b>How dangerous is war for civilians?</b><br> <br>Very dangerous. Between 1900 and 1990, 43 million soldiers died in wars. During the same period, 62 million civilians were killed. More than 34 million civilians died in World War II. One million died in North Korea. Hundreds of thousands were killed in South Korea, and 200,000 to 400,000 in Vietnam. In the wars of the 1990s, civilian deaths constituted between 75 and 90 percent of all war deaths.<br><br><b>What is the civilian experience in war?</b><br><br>They are shot, bombed, raped, starved, and driven from their homes. During World War II, 135,000 civilians died in two days in the firebombing of Dresden. A week later, in Pforzheim, Germany, 17,800 people were killed in 22 minutes. In Russia, after the three-year battle of Leningrad, only 600,000 civilians remained in a city that had held a population of 2.5 million. One million were evacuated, 100,000 were conscripted into the Red Army, and 800,000 died. In April 2003, during the Iraqi War, half of the 1.3 million civilians in Basra, Iraq, were trapped for days without food and water in temperatures in excess of 100 degrees.<br><br><b>How many refugees are there?</b><br><br>In 2001, 40 million people were displaced from their homes because of armed conflict or human rights violations. Refugees have been a concern throughout the twentieth century. Five million Europeans were uprooted from 1919 to 1939. World War II displaced 40 million non-Germans in Europe, and 13 million Germans were expelled from countries in Eastern Europe. Approximately 2.5 million of the 4.4 million people in Bosnia and Herzegovina were driven from their homes during that region's war in the early 1990s. More than 2 million Rwandans left their country in 1994. In 2001, 200,000 people were driven from Afghanistan to Pakistan. In early 2003, 45,000 Liberians were displaced from their homes.<br><br><b>What are the consequences of becoming a refugee?</b><br><br>Refugees have very high mortality rates, due primarily to malnutrition and infectious disease. Rwandan refugees in Zaire in 1994 had a death rate 25 to 50 times higher than prewar Rwandans. Iraqi Kurdish refugees in Turkey in 1991 had a death rate 18 times higher than usual.<br><br><b>How does war affect children?</b><br><br>More than 2 million children were killed in wars during the 1990s. Three times that number were disabled or seriously injured. Twenty million children were displaced from their homes in 2001. Many were forced into prostitution. A large percentage of those will contract AIDS. Children born to mothers who are raped or forced into prostitution often become outcasts.<br><br><b>How many child soldiers are there?</b><br><br>More than 300,000 worldwide. Soldiers are sometimes recruited at age 10 and younger. The youngest carry heavy packs, or sweep roads with brooms and branches to test for landmines. When children are hostile, the opposing army is more likely to consider every civilian a potential enemy.<br><br><b>Why do children join armies?</b><br><br>They are often forced to. Some are given alcohol or drugs, or exposed to atrocities, to desensitize them to violence. Some join to help feed or protect their families. Some are offered up by their parents in exchange for protection. Children can be fearless because they lack a clear concept of death.<br><br><b>How can war affect women?</b><br><br>Women often take on larger economic roles in wartime. They must find ways to compensate for their husband's military deployment or unemployment. Those in war zones must search for food, water, medicine, and fuel despite shortages. Some women in war zones are forced into prostitution to provide for their family. Famine and stress cause increased stillbirth and early infant death. AIDS risk increases for many women in war, from prostitution, husbands who return from military duty with HIV, or rape.<br><br><b>What is genocide?</b><br><br>Genocide is any number of acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group, according to the United Nations. Others include political and social groups in the definition, making genocide more broadly the annihilation of difference. Genocidal campaigns have become more frequent since World War I. Modern industrial weapons have made mass killings easier to commit.<br><br><b>How many genocides have occurred since World War I?</b><br><br>Dozens. The most devastating include those in the Soviet Union, where approximately 20 million were killed during Stalin's Great Terror (1930s); Nazi Germany, where 6 million Jews were killed in concentration camps along with 5 million or more Gypsies, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other "enemies of the German state" (1937-1945); Cambodia, where 1.7 million of the country's 7 million people were killed as a result of the actions of the Khmer Rouge (1975-1979); Iraq, where 50,000 Kurds were killed during the ethnic cleansing of Anfal in 1987; Bosnia, where 310,000 Muslims were killed (1992-1995); and Rwanda, where more than 1 million Tutsis and moderate Hutus were slaughtered over ten weeks in 1994.<br><br>Copyright � 2003 by Chris Hedges<br><br><b>Introduction</b><br><br>I have spent most of my adult life reporting war. By the time it was over, after nearly two decades, I had worked as a correspondent in about a dozen conflicts from Central America to Africa to the Middle East and the Balkans.

Is sanctification God's work or ours? Is it instantaneous or is it a process? The nature of Christian spirituality has been widely debated throughout the history of the church. The doctrine of sanctification was one of the main fissures separating Luther from the Catholic Church. Even today different groups of Protestants disagree on how we draw closer to God. What distinguishes the different poisitions and what exactly is at stake in these recurring debates? To answer these questions Donald L. Alexander, professor of biblical theology at Bethel College, has brought together five scholars that represent each of the main historical Protestant traditions: <ul><li>Gerhard O. Forde on the Lutheran vew</li><li>Sinclair B. Ferguson on the Reformed view</li><li>Laurence W. Wood on the Wesleyan view</li><li>Russell P. Spittler on the Pentecostal view</li><li>E. Glenn Hinson on the Contemplative view</li></ul> With an introduction by Alexander and responses to each of the main essays by the other contributors, this book provides a helpful and stimulating introduction to an important doctrine of the church.</p><p>Donald Alexander (Ph.D., University of California, Santa Barbara) is emeritus professor of Biblical Studies at Bethel University, St. Paul, MN.

George E. Lewis, who joined the collective as a teenager in 1971, establishes the full importance and vitality of the AACM with this communal history, written with a symphonic sweep that draws on a cross-generational chorus of voices and a rich collection of rare images.<br><br>Moving from Chicago to New York to Paris, and from founding member Steve McCall&#x2019;s kitchen table to Carnegie Hall, <i>A Power Stronger Than Itself</i> uncovers a vibrant, multicultural universe and brings to light a major piece of the history of avant-garde music and art.</p></p><p><p><b>George E. Lewis</b>&nbsp;is the Edwin H. Case Professor of American Music at Columbia University. A recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship in 2002, Lewis has made over 120 recordings as composer or performer, and his publications on experimental music appear regularly in scholarly and popular journals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>&#x201c;Written with the eye of an ethnographer, the ear of a performer, and the heart of a hometown dweller,&nbsp;George Lewis&#x2019;s account of the development of the AACM is an engaging story, a romance in which several generations of musicians triumph to create a music that travels around the world, yet is completely unique to their experiences.&nbsp;Reinscribing Chicago&nbsp;as a city of enormous artistic vitality and tough aesthetics,&nbsp;<i>A Power Stronger Than Itself&nbsp;</i>brilliantly redraws the map of jazz and widens the horizon for new and experimental music.&#x201d; (John Szwed, author of Space Is the Place: The Lives and Times of Sun Ra 2007-03-20)<br><br><p>&#x201c;George Lewis has outdone himself with this extraordinary volume.&nbsp;His unrelenting intelligence and ear for detail have produced a challenging compendium of late twentieth-century African Americana. This is not only a study of the AACM, it is a hope-drenched encomium to modernist creativity and the oppositional imagination.&#x201d;</p> (Paul Gilroy, author of Postcolonial Melancholia and The Black Atlantic 2007-12-11)<br><br><p>&#x201c;The AACM is one of our great cultural inventions. This extraordinary book embodies its principles, for George Lewis draws on multiple traditions: scholarship, reportage, testament, analysis, theory and criticism come together with virtuosity and scrupulous discipline. <i>A Power Stronger Than Itself</i> remaps the landscape of American experimental music. Academics, critics and musicians will have to reconfigure such terms as &#x2018;jazz,&#x2019; &#x2018;classical,&#x2019; &#x2018;soulful,&#x2019; &#x2018;avant-garde,&#x2019; &#x2018;black&#x2019; and &#x2018;white.&#x2019; Now the past yields unexpected wonders; the future unexpected possibilities.&#x201d;</p> (Margo Jefferson, author of On Michael Jackson 2008-01-09)<br><br>"A&nbsp;remarkable book, not just for corralling an enormous amount of information&#x2014;interviews, critical reviews, music charts, news reports (the bibliography runs 35 pages)&#x2014;but for making the result a digestible and thoroughly entertaining 500-page read.&#x201d; (<i>Time Out Chicago</i> 2008-04-10)<br><br>"With <i>A Power Stronger Than Itself</i>, Lewis exceeds expectations. For rather than merely recount the ascent of the AACM, he elegantly sets it against the backdrop of cultural, racial and social changes that shook the twentieth century. . . . Lewis unreels this tale with dramatic flourish and scholarly authority, in effect telling the story of not only the AACM but also the city where it&#x2019;s centered, Chicago." (Howard Reich <i>Chicago Tribune</i> 2008-04-13)<br><br>"Lewis&#x2019;s landmark book. . .&nbsp;goes deeper into the formation and development of the AACM than any previous history, and as a formal acknowledgement of the group&#x2019;s enormous importance and influence it&#x2019;s long overdue." (Peter Margasak <i>Chicago Reader</i> 2008-04-10)<br><br>"This could very well be the most anticipiated book of the year. . . . The long wait is now over and patrience will be rewarded. George Lewis's encyclopedic knowledge, thorough research and in-depth interviews have produced an eye-opening work. . . . Overall, it is a pleasant read, scholarly but not overly academic in tone, covering a wide stylistic range--from essay to storytelling to autobiography." (Alain Drouot <i>Jazz Notes</i>)<br><br>"[Lewis] sets a new standard for scholarly writing about the people who make Great Black Music, or any other kind.. . . . Reading Lewis's book about the AACM makes one want to have been a part of it." (<i>Downbeat</i>)<br><br>"Simply put, George E. Lewis' new and long-awaited history of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) must be considered among the most important books ever written about creative music. A tour de force of narrative history and analysis driven by a clearly articulated point of view, it draws on a massive body of scholarship and original research that places Great Black Music in its historical, aesthetic, and social contexts. It will certainly shape the scholarly, critical, and public discussion of jazz and creative music for years to come." (Ed Hazell <i>Signal to Noise</i>)<br><br>"Rich and dense and gratifyingly readable. . . . [Lewis] makes a scholarly portrait of a complex community into a ripping good and inspiring yarn."

By analyzing the thought and influence of three leading critics of modern Germany, this study will demonstrate the dangers and dilemmas of a particular type of cultural despair. Lagarde, Langbehn, and Moeller van den Bruck-their active lives spanning the years from the middle of the past century to the threshold of Hitler&#39;s Third Reich-attacked, often incisively and justly, the deficiencies of German culture and the German spirit. But they were more than the critics of Germany&#39;s cultural crisis; they were its symptoms and victims as well. Unable to endure the ills which they diagnosed and which they had experienced in their own lives, they sought to become prophets who would point the way to a national rebirth. Hence, they propounded all manner of reforms, ruthless and idealistic, nationalistic and utopian. It was this leap from despair to utopia across all existing reality that gave their thought its fantastic quality.</p><p>"A most valuable contribution to the study of modern totalitarianism. . . . The book is indispensable for every student of the atmosphere before Hitler's advent to power."--<i>The Annuals</i>&nbsp;"An enlightening and solidly documented book of great value to those who would like to trace the ideological roots behind the most erratic and dramatic political phases of modern Germany."--<i>American Political Science Review</i>&nbsp;"It is a special merit of Stern's treatment that he combines his examination of the German case of 'Conservative Revolution' with a recognition that the phenomenon is world wide. . . . &nbsp;Stern's book is a delight to read. His erudition is never allowed to smother a brilliant style, and nearly every paragraph is marked by arresting epigrams."--<i>American Historical Review</i>This is a study in the pathology of cultural criticism. By analyzing the thought and influence of three leading critics of modern Germany, this study will demonstrate the dangers and dilemmas of a particular type of cultural despair.</p><h2>Decoding the Ethics Code: A Practical Guide for Psychologists</h2><p>Revised to reflect the current status of scientific and professional theory, practices, and debate across all facets of ethical decision making, this latest edition of Celia B.

On the outer patio there is a cabana and a bar with a bartender mixing drinks and a large black weight-lifter beside him at an outdoor stainless steel grill cooking steaks and ribs. In the room itself are tables and sofas. There are two waitresses on rollerskates taking drinks and food to people, one in a bikini and the other in panties and T-shirt. One of the cheetahs is stretched out on a sofa and the other is crossing the room. The waitress pulls up at the bar and orders two Budweisers.

She smiles again at the counselor as she passes him.</i><br><br>Malkina: Hola, Guapo.<br>Counselor: Hey.<br><i><br>She goes out and closes the door and Reiner gets off of the desk and turns his leather swivel-chair and sits in it and motions the counselor to a leather sofa at the end of the desk<br>and at right angles to it. The counselor comes over and sits down.</i><br><br>Reiner: How&#x2019;s the bride?<br>Counselor: Bridal.<br>Reiner: That sounds about right. Nice lady. I assume she&#x2019;s not privy to your newest business venture.<br>Counselor: She&#x2019;s not. And your lady?<br>Reiner: Yeah.<br>Counselor: Yeah what.<br>Reiner: She&#x2019;s fine. I don't know what she knows. I don't want to know.<br>Counselor: You don't trust her.<br>Reiner: Jesus, Counselor. She&#x2019;s a woman.<br>Counselor: Woo.<br>Reiner: Yeah, well. I don't mean it to sound that cold. I just mean that where men are concerned they&#x2019;ve got their own agenda. I always liked smart women. But it&#x2019;s been an expensive hobby.<br>Counselor: Yeah. <i>(Nodding toward the electronic wall)</i> Do you know what all that stuff is?<br>Reiner: Mostly. Anything I don't know I can ask her. Which worries me even more.<br>Counselor: Mmm.<br>Reiner: Yeah.<br>Counselor: You never told me what happened with you<br>and the lovely Clarissa.<br>Reiner: Miss Clarissa. Of the extraordinary body. What happened? I think in the end it was jealousy that undid us.<br>Counselor: Jealousy?<br>Reiner: Yeah. She was getting more pussy than I was.<br>Counselor:<i> (Smiling)</i> Is that true?<br>Reiner: I don't know. Probably. I have to say that for a girl who liked girls she took an extraordinary interest in the male member. She sucked on it so hard it finally corrected<br>my vision. She left me for this good-looking black woman. Had a boyfriend played for the Oilers. Nice chap. We met once for drinks at a club in Dallas to discuss our mutual plight. He was taking it rather poorly, I have to say. Women do better don't they?<br>Counselor: Maybe they have more practice at it.<br>Reiner: Yeah, well. My guess is that in most cases if you still had the woman you&#x2019;re weeping over you&#x2019;d be weeping harder.<br>Counselor: <i>(Smiling) </i>You cant hear anything in here, can you?<br>Reiner: It&#x2019;s better than that.<br>Counselor: Yeah?<br>Reiner: You can't hear anything out there.<br>Counselor: So is this place secure?<br>Reiner: Who knows? I don't speak in arraignable phrases anywhere. There&#x2019;s a scrambler on the phone but still there&#x2019;s a lot of smart people out there. Of course anybody who thinks he&#x2019;s the smartest is on his way to the slam.<br>Counselor: Would that be me?<br>Reiner: Nah. Although I have to say that I always did think a law degree was a license to steal. And that you for one hadn't really capitalized on it.<br><i><br>The counselor shrugs.</i><br><br>Reiner: Yeah. Well, you&#x2019;re not the straight dude people think though, are you?<br>Counselor: I guess not.<br>Reiner: I don't mean the caper. I mean you. Women like you.<br>Counselor: All right.<br>Reiner: You know what they like about you?<br>Counselor: I&#x2019;m a good fuck?<br>Reiner: Yeah, right. They can sniff out the moral dilemma. The paradox.<br>Counselor: Moral dilemma.<br>Reiner: Yeah. They&#x2019;re drawn to it. Not sure why. Maybe it&#x2019;s just that lacking any moral sense themselves they&#x2019;re fascinated by it in men. You think about it. You want to know if a guy has issues watch the way women react to him.<br>Counselor: Interesting.<br>Reiner: Men are attracted to flawed women too of course, but their illusion is that they can fix them. Women don't want to fix anything. They just want to be entertained.The truth about women is you can do anything to them except bore them. <br>Counselor: Well, there&#x2019;s nothing about Laura that I would want to fix.<br>Reiner: Maybe not.<br>Counselor: But you think she probably knows things about me that I don't know about myself. <br>Reiner: Jesus, Counselor. I&#x2019;m not even sure what sort of a question that is.<br>Counselor: Yeah. And you? Vis-�-vis your inamorata.<br>Reiner: You don't want to know. I don't want to know.<br>Counselor: Moral dilemmas.<br>Reiner: Yeah. You pursue this road that you&#x2019;ve embarked upon and you will eventually come to moral decisions that will take you completely by surprise. You wont see it coming at all. <br>Counselor: Such as?<br>Reiner: Such as whether to waste somebody. Or have them wasted.<br>Counselor: You ever been faced with a decision like that?<br>Reiner: You&#x2019;re a member of the court.<br>Counselor Well. I don't intend to take this up as a trade.<br>Reiner: One-time deal. Right?<br>Counselor: Which you&#x2019;ve heard a thousand times.<br>Reiner: No. But a few. What usually happens is that after a couple of deals they know more than you do and they set up shop across the street.<br>Counselor: How does that work out for them?<br>Reiner: Not well.<br>Counselor: So would that be a moral issue?<br>Reiner: Not for me.<br>Counselor: Or for your associates.<br>Reiner: Yeah well. They have a real aversion to mixing business with pleasure. Do you know what a bolito is?<br>Counselor: No. A bolo is one of those skinny neckties. Or is it one of those things you throw? Argentina.<br>Reiner: Yeah. In this case it&#x2019;s a mechanical device. It has this small electric motor with this rather incredible compound gear that retrieves a steel cable. Battery-driven. The cable is made out of some unholy alloy, almost impossible to cut it, and it&#x2019;s in a loop, and you come up behind the guy and drop it over his head and pull the free end of the cable tight and walk away. No one ever sees you. Pulling the cable activates the motor and the noose starts to tighten and it continues to tighten until it goes to zero.<br>Counselor: It cuts the guy&#x2019;s head off.<br>Reiner: It can.<br>Counselor: There&#x2019;s nothing he can do.<br>Reiner: No.<br>Counselor: Jesus.<br>Reiner: Yeah.<br>Counselor: How long does it take?<br>Reiner: Three, four minutes. Five maybe. It depends on your collar size.<br>Counselor: You&#x2019;re shitting me.<br>Reiner: Nope. Mostly wretched excess of course. It&#x2019;s just that there&#x2019;d be no easy way to turn the thing off. Or reason to. It just keeps running until the noose closes completely<br>and then it self-destructs. Actually you&#x2019;re probably dead in less than a minute.<br>Counselor: From strangulation.<br>Reiner: No. The wire cuts through the carotid arteries and sprays blood all over the spectators and then everybody goes home.<br>Counselor: Jesus.<br>Reiner: Yeah, well.<br>Counselor: Bolito.<br>Reiner: Yeah. Probably a play on words too. Boleto&#x2014;with an e&#x2014;is the spanish word for ticket. As in yours has just been punched. <br>Counselor: I wouldn't think it would go through bone.<br>Reiner: It wont. It would have to go between the vertebrae. The gear is a worm drive with a gain built into it. Or a reduction, actually. It keeps getting stronger and slower. To compensate for the compression of the tissue.<br>Counselor: How do you know all this?<br>Reiner: You know how I like gadgets. Anyway, a friend of mine got hold of one. In Calexico. Stolen out of County Property.<br>Counselor: I would think they&#x2019;d be expensive.<br>Reiner: They are. This one was used.<br>Counselor: Sweet.<br><br><i>Reiner shrugs.</i><br><br>Counselor: Why does no one see him?<br>Reiner: See who?<br>Counselor: The garroteer.<br>Reiner: Oh. Well, given a choice between watching someone walk away down the street and watching someone being slowly decapitated by a device apparently engineered and patented in the halls of hell you are going to watch the latter. That&#x2019;s just the way it is. You may think you should avert your gaze. But you wont.<br>Counselor: Where&#x2019;s all this beheading shit come from? You never used to see that.<br>Reiner: Yeah. It&#x2019;s blown in here from the East.<br>Counselor Meaning the East.<br>Reiner: Yeah. You put nine Mexicans and an Arab in a room and give them each a hundred dollars and come back in a couple of hours who do you think is going to be holding<br>the grand?<br>Counselor: So are you gearing up to do business with them down the road?<br>Reiner: The Arabs?<br>Counselor: Yeah.<br>Reiner: No.<br>Counselor: Why is that?<br>Reiner Because they don't need your money.<br><br>* * * * *</p><h2>The Book of Understanding: Creating Your Own Path to Freedom</h2><p>The path to freedom is filled with questions and uncertainty. Is it possible to truly know who we are? Do our lives have a purpose, or are we just accidental? What are we meant to contribute? What are we meant to become, to create, and to share? In <i>The Book of Understanding</i>, Osho, one of the most provocative thinkers of our time, challenges us to understand our world and ourselves in a new and radical way. The first step toward understanding, he says, is to question and doubt all that we have been taught to believe.<br><br>All our lives we&#x2019;ve been handed so-called truths by countless others&#x2014;beliefs we learned to accept without reason. It is only in questioning our beliefs, assumptions, and prejudices that we can begin to uncover our own unique voice and heal the divisions within us and without.<br><br>Once we discover our authentic self, we can embrace all aspects of the human experience&#x2014;from the earthy, pleasure-loving qualities that characterize Zorba the Greek to the watchful, silent qualities of Gautam the Buddha. We can become whole and live with integrity, able to respond with creativity and compassion to the religious, political, and cultural divides that currently plague our society.<br><br>In this groundbreaking work, Osho identifies, loosens, and ultimately helps to untie the knots of fear and misunderstanding that restrict us&#x2014;leaving us free to discover and create our own individual path to freedom.<br>Doubt&#x2014;because doubt is not a sin, it is the sign of your intelligence.<br><br>You are not responsible to any nation, to any church, to any God. You are responsible only for one thing, and that is self-knowledge. And the miracle is, if you can fulfill this responsibility, you will be able to fulfill many other responsibilities without any effort. The moment you come to your own being, a revolution happens in your vision. Your whole outlook about life goes through a radical change. You start feeling new responsibilities&#x2014;not as something to be done, not as duty to be fulfilled, but as a joy to do. <b>&#x2014;OSHO</b></p><p>Osho, known for his revolutionary contribution to the science of inner transformation, continues to inspire millions of people worldwide in their search to define a new approach to individual spirituality that is self-directed and responsive to the everyday challenges of contemporary life. The <i>Sunday Times</i> of London named him one of the &#x201c;1,000 Makers of the Twentieth Century,&#x201d; and novelist Tom Robbins called him &#x201c;the most dangerous man since Jesus Christ.&#x201d; For more information about Osho and his work, please visit osho.com.WORLDLY VS. OTHERWORLDLY<br><br> Understanding the Great Divide<br> I propose a new religiousness. It will not be Christianity and it will not be Judaism and it will not be Hinduism; this religiousness will not have any adjective to it. It will be purely a quality of being whole.<br><br> Religion has failed. Science has failed. The East has failed, and the West has failed. Something of a higher synthesis is needed in which East and West can have a meeting, in which religion and science can have a meeting.<br><br> The human being is like a tree, with its roots in the earth and the potential to flower. Religion has failed because it was talking only of the flowers--and those flowers remain philosophical, abstract; they never materialize. They could not materialize because they were not supported by the earth. And science has failed because it has cared only about the roots. The roots are ugly, and there seems to be no flowering. Religion has failed because it was otherworldly and it neglected this world. And you cannot neglect this world--to neglect this world is to neglect your own roots. Science has failed because it neglected the other world, the inner, and you cannot neglect the flowers. Once you neglect the flowers, the innermost core of being, life loses all meaning.<br><br> Just as the tree needs roots, so does the human being need roots--and the roots can only be in the earth. The tree needs an open sky to grow into, to come to great foliage and to have thousands of flowers. Then only is the tree fulfilled; then only does the tree feel significance and meaning, and life becomes relevant.<br><br> The West is suffering from too much science, and the East has suffered from too much religion. Now we need a new humanity in which religion and science become two aspects of one humanity. And once we have brought this new humanity into existence, the earth can become for the first time what it is meant to become. It can become a paradise: this very body the Buddha, this very earth the paradise.<br><br> Zorba the Buddha: A meeting of earth<br><br> and sky<br><br> My concept of a new human being is one that will be Zorba the Greek and will also be Gautam the Buddha: the new human being will be "Zorba the Buddha"--sensuous and spiritual. Physical, utterly physical--in the body, in the senses, enjoying the body and all that the body makes possible--and still a great consciousness, a great witnessing will be there. Zorba the Buddha--it has never happened before.<br><br> That's what I'm talking about when I talk about a meeting of the East and the West, the meeting of materialism and spirituality. That's my idea of Zorba the Buddha: heaven and earth are united.<br><br> I want there to be no schizophrenia, no split between matter and spirit, between the mundane and the sacred, between this-worldly and that-worldly. I don't want any split, because every split is a split in you. And any person, any humanity that is divided against itself is going to be crazy and insane. We are living in a crazy and insane world. It can be sane only if this split can be bridged.<br><br> Mankind has lived believing either in the reality of the soul and the illusoriness of matter, or in the reality of matter and the illusoriness of the soul. You can divide the humanity of the past into those who are spiritual and those who are materialists. But nobody has bothered to look at the reality of the human being. We are both together. We are neither just spirituality--not just consciousness--nor are we just matter. We are a tremendous harmony between matter and consciousness. Or perhaps matter and consciousness are not two things but only two aspects of one reality: Matter is the outside of consciousness, and consciousness is the interiority of matter. But there has not been a single philosopher, sage, or religious mystic in the past who has declared this unity; they were all in favor of dividing the human being, calling one side real and the other side unreal. This has created an atmosphere of schizophrenia all over the earth.<br><br> You cannot live just as a body. That's what Jesus means when he says, "Man cannot live by bread alone"--but this is only half the truth. You need consciousness, you cannot live by bread alone, true--but you cannot live without bread, either. You have both dimensions to your being, and both dimensions have to be fulfilled, to be given equal opportunity for growth. But the past has been either in favor of one and against the other, or in favor of the other and against the first. Man as a totality has not been accepted.<br><br> This has created misery, anguish, and a tremendous darkness; a night that has lasted for thousands of years and seems to have no end. If you only listen to the body, you condemn yourself to a meaningless existence. And if you don't listen to the body, you suffer--you are hungry, you are poor, you are thirsty. If you listen only to consciousness, your growth will be lopsided. Your consciousness will grow, but your body will shrink and the balance will be lost. And in the balance is your health, in the balance is your wholeness, in the balance is your joy, your song, your dance.<br><br> The materialist has chosen to listen to the body and has become completely deaf as far as the reality of consciousness is concerned. The ultimate result is great science, great technology--an affluent society, a richness of things that are mundane, worldly. And amidst all this abundance there is a poor human being without a soul, completely lost--not knowing who he is, not knowing why he is, feeling almost like an accident or a freak of nature.<br><br> Unless consciousness grows along with the richness of the material world, the body becomes too heavy and the soul becomes too weak. You are burdened by your own inventions, your own discoveries. Rather than creating a beautiful life for you, they create a life that is felt by intelligent people to be not worth living.<br><br> The East in the past has chosen consciousness and has condemned matter and everything material, the body included, as maya. They have called it illusory, a mirage in a desert that only appears to exist but has no reality in itself. The East has created a Gautam Buddha, a Mahavira, a Patanjali, a Kabir, a Farid, a Raidas--a long line of people with great consciousness, with great awareness. But it has also created millions of poor people, hungry, starving, dying like dogs--with not enough food, no pure water to drink, not enough clothes, not enough shelter.<br><br> A strange situation. . . . In the developed countries every six months they have to drown millions and millions of dollars' worth of foodstuffs in the ocean, because it is surplus. They don't want to overload their warehouses, they don't want to lower their prices and destroy their economic structure. On the one hand, in Ethiopia a thousand people are dying every day, and on the other hand the European Common Market is destroying so much food that the cost of destroying it is in the millions of dollars. That is not the cost of the food; it is the cost of taking it and throwing it into the ocean. Who is responsible for this situation?<br><br> The richest man in the West is searching for his soul and finding himself hollow--without any love, only lust; without any prayer, only parrotlike words that he has been taught in the Sunday schools. He has no sense of spirituality, no feeling for other human beings, no reverence for life, for birds, for trees, for animals. Destruction is so easy--Hiroshima and Nagasaki would never have happened if people were not thought to be just things. So many nuclear weapons would not have been piled up if the human being had been considered to be a hidden god, a hidden splendor--not to be destroyed but to be discovered, not to be destroyed but to be brought into the light, with the body as a temple for the spirit. But if a human being is just matter--just chemistry, physics, a skeleton covered with skin--then with death everything dies, nothing remains. That's why it becomes possible for an Adolf Hitler to kill six million people--if people are just matter, there is no question of even thinking twice.<br><br> The West, in its pursuit of material abundance, lost its soul, its interiority. Surrounded by meaninglessness, boredom, anguish, it cannot find its own humanity. All the success of science proves to be of no use--because the house is full of things, but the master of the house is missing. In the East, the end result of centuries of considering matter to be illusory and only consciousness to be real has been that the master is alive but the house is empty. It is difficult to rejoice with hungry stomachs, with sick bodies, with death surrounding you; it is impossible to meditate. So, unnecessarily, they have been losers.<br><br> All the saints and all the philosophers--the spiritual and the materialist both--are responsible for this immense crime against humanity.<br><br> Zorba the Buddha is the answer. It is the synthesis of matter and soul. It is a declaration that there is no conflict between matter and consciousness, that we can be rich on both sides. We can have everything that the world can provide, everything that science and technology can produce, and we can still have everything that a Buddha, a Kabir, a Nanak finds in his inner being--the flowers of ecstasy, the fragrance of godliness, the wings of ultimate freedom.<br><br> Zorba the Buddha is the new human being, is the rebel. The rebellion consists of destroying the schizophrenia of humanity, destroying the dividedness--destroying the idea that spirituality is against materialism and materialism is against spirituality. It is a manifesto that body and soul are together. Existence is full of spirituality--even mountains are alive, even trees are sensitive. It is a declaration that the whole of existence is both material and spiritual--or perhaps just one energy expressing itself in two ways, as matter and as consciousness. When energy is purified, it expresses itself as consciousness; when energy is crude, unpurified, dense, it appears as matter. But the whole of existence is nothing but an energy field. This is my experience, it is not my philosophy. And it is supported by modern physics and its research: Existence is energy.<br><br> We can allow ourselves to have both the worlds together. We need not renounce this world to get the other world; neither have we to deny the other world to enjoy this world. In fact, to have only one world while you are capable of having both is to be unnecessarily poor.<br><br> Zorba the Buddha is the richest possibility. We will live our nature to its utmost and we will sing songs of this earth. We will not betray the earth, and we will not betray the sky either. We will claim all that this earth has--all the flowers, all the pleasures--and we will also claim all the stars of the sky. We will claim the whole existence as our home.<br><br> All that existence contains is for us, and we have to use it in every possible way--without any guilt, without any conflict, without any choice. Choicelessly enjoy all that matter is capable of, and rejoice in all that consciousness is capable of.<br><br> There is an ancient story. . . .<br><br> In a forest near a city there lived two beggars. Naturally they were enemies to each other, as all professionals are--two doctors, two professors, two saints. One beggar was blind and one was lame, and they were very competitive; the whole day they were competing with each other in the city.<br><br> But one night their huts caught fire, because the whole forest was on fire. The blind man could run out, but he could not see where to go. He could not see the places where the fire had not yet spread. The lame man could see where there were still possibilities of escaping from the fire, but he could not run. The fire was spreading fast, so the lame man could only see his death coming.<br><br> They realized that they needed each other. The lame man had a sudden realization: "The other man can run, the blind man can run and I can see." They forgot all their competition. In such a critical moment, when both were facing death, each necessarily forgot all stupid enmities. They created a great synthesis; they agreed that the blind man would carry the lame man on his shoulders and they would function as one person--the lame man could see, and the blind man could run, and in this way they saved their lives. And because they saved each other's lives they became friends; for the first time they dropped their antagonism.<br><br> Zorba is blind--he cannot see, but he can dance, he can sing, he can rejoice. The Buddha can see, but he can only see. He is pure eyes, just clarity and perception--but he cannot dance. He is crippled, he cannot sing, he cannot rejoice.<br><br> It is time. The world is on fire and everybody's life is in danger. The meeting of Zorba and Buddha can save the whole of humanity. Their meeting is the only hope. Buddha can contribute consciousness, clarity, the eyes to see beyond, the eyes to see that which is almost invisible. Zorba can give his whole being to Buddha's vision--and his participation will make sure that it does not remain just a dry vision but a dancing, rejoicing, ecstatic way of life.<br><br> ?Is the meeting of Zorba and the Buddha really possible? If it is, then why have other religious leaders never thought about it?<br><br> The first thing to be understood: I am not a religious leader. A religious leader cannot think of things, cannot see things the way I can, for the simple reason that he has an immense investment in religion; I have none.<br><br> Religions are necessarily splitting people, creating a duality in the human mind. That is their way of exploiting you. If you are whole, you are beyond their control. If you are cut in fragments, then all your strength is destroyed, all your power, your dignity abolished. Then you can be a Christian, a Hindu, a Mohammedan. If you are left just the way you are born--natural, without any interference from the so-called religious leaders, you will have freedom, independence, integrity. You cannot be enslaved. And all your old religions are doing nothing but enslaving you.<br><br> To enslave you, they have to create a conflict within you so you start fighting with yourself.</p><h2>Simply Good News: Why the Gospel Is News and What Makes It Good</h2><p><p>The bishop, Bible scholar, modern heir to C.

After the necessary foundations are established in Volumes I and II, the guitarist now has the requisite skill set to start to tackle pitch and time relationships, and more importantly, to apply them in real world playing situations. A wide range of subjects are explained and presented in a non-linear format, which allows each player to study what is relevant to his or her needs, without wasting their time on areas in which they have no interest. Fretboard Logic offers a way to navigate the complexities of advanced music concepts without the boredom and frustration usually associated with learning these subjects on a guitar.</p><p>Volume III expands exponentially on the foundations established in the first two books.

He is currently in private practice in Pennsylvania.This book explains so much about why you choose the mate you do. Made total sense to me (and my book club too) It is an understandable and quick read that borrows from Friend. Why do you, a perfectionist, marry a complete slob?This book gives a pretty compelling answer to this type of question. Does your wife remind you so much of your mother and does she irritate you in in the exact same way? The book discusses this type of thing too. And it says that there are no perfect marriages....there are great marriages with problems, pretty good with problems and bad with problems. This book helps you cope with those problems that we all have. Check it out! --Amazon<br><br>An excellent book for everyone to understand themselves and other people they are relating to. Too bad people do not read this sort of information before getting into relationships. It will help anyone to make a better selection on choosing a partner and help couples understand why they irritate each other/choose the people they choose and hopefully find peace and happiness in their relationships. --Amazon<br><br>It promotes self understanding and one could realize the difficulties in a relationship may not always be the other person. Parenting is difficult, not a perfect science and therefore all of us could use some minor tune ups.

Is this another insignificant day in the life of a farmer? Perhaps-but look again. This is a trip kids will want to take again and again.</p><p>David Macaulay connects the seemingly unconnected in this playful, witty collection of overlapping stories. Young readers must listen and watch carefully in order to track one story's clues that later pop up in another story. For example, Albert and his horse June take a shortcut over the railroad tracks on their way to sell melons at the market. Because they get there so early they are able to go home sooner than planned. Three chapters later, Albert and June's efficiency leads to another character's disappointment... and even a run-in with the law. Then there's poor Professor Tweet, who runs afowl of a hot-air balloon ride. But a few chapters later we discover that Professor Tweet's misfortune has lead to another man's most excellent fortune! Macaulay's characters are thoroughly engaging, such as the horse June, who wears curlers in her mane and likes to kick back in front of the TV. Many know Macaulay as the master of pen-and-ink detail, but here he proves himself as a versatile color artist, offering a richly blended palette and unusual visual perspectives. A funny, child-friendly shortcut into the study of cause and effect.

Advice on tackle selecting, reading water, and scouting.</p><p>The author, being that most unusual creature--an honest angler--offers this caveat on the opening page: "Many of us have elevated fly fishing (especially our favorite kind) to the highest category of human endeavor: something we don't need to explain unless we feel like it. Of course, if we <i>do</i> feel like explaining it, look out. We're liable to start referring to it as an 'art' and maybe even sit down and write a book or something." The rest you can guess. This is one man's opinion about the art of fishing small streams with a fly rod--a guide that is always entertaining and frequently worthy of underlining. Readers familiar with the John Gierach of <i>Dances with Trout</i> and <i>Even Brook Trout Get the Blues</i> will recognize in <i>Fly Fishing Small Streams</i> the folksy wisdom and amiable writing that has made this trout-bumming author's books of essays so popular. However, like <i>Flyfishing: The High Country</i> and <i>Fishing Bamboo</i>, it's an instructional. This isn't to say it's not a fun read, but it remains foremost a guidebook--and a very useful one at that. --Langdon Cook, Sports &amp; Outdoors editorJohn Gierach is the author of At the Grave of the Unknown Fisherman (0-7432-2992-4), Death, Taxes, and Leaky Waders (0-684-86858-X), and Good Flies (1-58574-139-6), and he has written articles for Fly Rod &amp; Reel, Gray's Sporting Journal, and Field &amp; Stream.

P. Seligman, Zellerbach Family Professor of Psychology at that University of Pennsylvania and author of <i>Learned Optimism&nbsp;&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>Why are we devastated by a word of criticism even when it&#x2019;s mixed with lavish praise? Because our brains are wired to focus on the bad. This negativity effect explains things great and small: why countries blunder into disastrous wars, why couples divorce, why people flub job interviews, how schools fail students, why football coaches stupidly punt on fourth down. All day long, the power of bad governs people&#x2019;s moods, drives marketing campaigns, and dominates news and politics.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eminent social scientist Roy F. Baumeister stumbled unexpectedly upon this fundamental aspect of human nature. To find out why financial losses mattered more to people than financial gains, Baumeister looked for situations in which good events made a bigger impact than bad ones. But his team couldn&#x2019;t find any. Their research showed that bad is relentlessly stronger than good, and their paper has become one of the most-cited in the scientific literature.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our brain&#x2019;s negativity bias makes evolutionary sense because it kept our ancestors alert to fatal dangers, but it distorts our perspective in today&#x2019;s media environment. The steady barrage of bad news and crisismongering makes us feel helpless and leaves us needlessly fearful and angry. We ignore our many blessings, preferring to heed&#x2014;and vote for&#x2014;the voices telling us the world is going to hell. <br> &nbsp;<br> But once we recognize our negativity bias, the rational brain can overcome the power of bad when it&#x2019;s harmful and employ that power when it&#x2019;s beneficial. In fact, bad breaks and bad feelings create the most powerful incentives to become smarter and stronger. Properly understood, bad can be put to perfectly good use.<br><br> As noted science journalist John Tierney and Baumeister show in this wide-ranging book, we can adopt proven strategies to avoid the pitfalls that doom relationships, careers, businesses, and nations. Instead of despairing at what&#x2019;s wrong in your life and in the world, you can see how much is going right&#x2014;and how to make it still better.</p><p><b>John Tierney</b>, the coauthor of&nbsp;<i>Willpower</i>, is a contributing editor to <i>City Journal</i> and writes the &#x201c;Findings&#x201d; science column for the <i>New York Times</i>.

They were old&#x2014;bought from Goodwill&#x2014;with big shiny heads, different-colored tails, and frizzy hair. <br> <br>Zachary Barlow could almost imagine their fins lashing back and forth as they waited for the boat to get closer, their silly plastic smiles hiding their lethal intentions. They&#x2019;d crash the ship against the shallows if they could, lure the crew into the sea, and eat the pirates with their jagged teeth. <br> <br>Zachary rummaged through his bag of action figures. He pulled out the pirate with the two cutlasses and placed him gently at the center of the boat-shaped paper they&#x2019;d weighed down with driveway gravel. Without gravel, the Neptune&#x2019;s Pearl was likely to blow away in the early autumn wind. He could almost believe he wasn&#x2019;t on the scrubby lawn in front of Poppy&#x2019;s ramshackle house with the sagging siding, but aboard a real ship, with salt spray stinging his face, on his way to adventure.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to have to lash ourselves to the mast,&#x201d; Zach said, as William the Blade, captain of the Neptune&#x2019;s Pearl. Zach had a different way of speaking for each of his figures. He wasn&#x2019;t sure that anyone but him could tell his voices apart, but he felt different when he talked in them.<br> <br>Alice&#x2019;s braids spilled in front of her amber eyes as she moved a G.I. Joe Lady Jaye figure closer to the center of the boat. Lady Jaye was a thief who&#x2019;d begun traveling with William the Blade after she&#x2019;d been unsuccessful in picking his pocket. She was loud and wild, almost nothing like Alice, who chafed under the thumb of her overprotective grandmother, but did it quietly.<br> <br>&#x201c;You think the Duke&#x2019;s guards will be waiting for us in Silverfall?&#x201d; Alice made Lady Jaye ask.<br> <br>&#x201c;He might catch us,&#x201d; said Zach, grinning at her. &#x201c;But he&#x2019;ll never hold us. Nothing will. We&#x2019;re on a mission for the Great Queen and we won&#x2019;t be stopped.&#x201d; He hadn&#x2019;t expected to say those words until they came out of his mouth, but they felt right. They felt like William&#x2019;s true thoughts.<br> <br>That was why Zach loved playing: those moments where it seemed like he was accessing some other world, one that felt real as anything. It was something he never wanted to give up. He&#x2019;d rather go on playing like this forever, no matter how old they got, although he didn&#x2019;t see how that was possible. It was already hard sometimes.<br> <br>Poppy tucked windblown strands of red hair behind her ears and regarded Zach and Alice very seriously. She was tiny and fierce, with freckles thick enough to remind Zach of the stars at night. She liked nothing better than being in charge of the story and had a sense of how to make a moment dramatic. That was why she was the best at playing villains.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can knot ropes to keep you safe, but no boat can pass through these waters unless a sacrifice is given to the deep,&#x201d; Poppy made one of the mermaids say. &#x201c;Willingly or unwillingly. If one of your crew doesn&#x2019;t leap into the sea, the sea will choose her own sacrifice. That&#x2019;s the mermaid&#x2019;s curse.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alice and Zach exchanged a look. Were the mermaids telling the truth? Really, Poppy wasn&#x2019;t supposed to make up rules like that&#x2014;ones that no one else had agreed to&#x2014;but Zach objected only when he didn&#x2019;t like them. A curse seemed like it could be fun.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll all go down together before we lose a single member of this crew,&#x201d; he fake-shouted in William&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re on a mission for the Great Queen, and we fear her curse more than yours.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But just then,&#x201d; said Poppy ominously, moving one of the mermaids to the edge of the ship, &#x201c;webbed fingers grab Lady Jaye&#x2019;s ankle, and the mermaid pulls her over the side of the boat. She&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t do that!&#x201d; Alice said. &#x201c;I was lashed to the mast.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t specify that you were,&#x201d; Poppy told her. &#x201c;William suggested it, but you didn&#x2019;t say whether or not you did it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alice groaned, as though Poppy was being especially annoying. Which she kind of was. &#x201c;Well, Lady Jaye was in the middle of the boat. Even if she wasn&#x2019;t lashed, a mermaid couldn&#x2019;t get to her without crawling on board.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If Lady Jaye gets pulled over the side, I&#x2019;m going after her,&#x201d; Zach said, plunging William into the gravel water. &#x201c;I meant it when I said no one gets left behind.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t get pulled over the side,&#x201d; Alice insisted.<br> <br>As they continued arguing two of Poppy&#x2019;s brothers walked out of the house, letting the screen door slam behind them. They looked over and started to snicker. The older of the two, Tom, pointed directly at Zach and said something under his breath. His younger brother laughed.<br> <br>Zach felt his face heat. He didn&#x2019;t think they knew anyone at his middle school, but still. If any of his teammates found out that, at twelve, he was still playing with action figures, basketball would become a lot less fun. School could get bad too.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ignore them,&#x201d; Poppy declared loudly. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re jerks.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All we were going to say is that Alice&#x2019;s grandma called,&#x201d; Tom said, his face a parody of hangdog innocence. He and Nate had the same tomato-red hair as their sister, but they weren&#x2019;t much like her in any other way that Zach could see. They, along with their eldest sister, were always in trouble&#x2014;fighting, cutting school, smoking, and other stuff. The Bell kids were considered hoodlums in town and, Poppy aside, they seemed intent on doing what they could to uphold that reputation. &#x201c;Old lady Magnaye says that you need to be home before dark and for us to be sure to tell you not to forget or make excuses. She seems rough, Alice.&#x201d; The words were supposed to be nice, but you could tell from the sickly sweet way Tom talked that he wasn&#x2019;t being nice at all.<br> <br>Alice stood up and brushed off her skirt. The orange glow of the setting sun bronzed her skin and turned her glossy box braids metallic. Her eyes narrowed. Her expression wavered between flustered and angry. Boys had been hassling her ever since she&#x2019;d hit ten, gotten curves, and started looking a lot older than she was. Zach hated the way Tom talked to her, like he was making fun of her without really saying anything bad, but he never knew what to say to stop it either. <br> <br>&#x201c;Leave off,&#x201d; Zach told them.<br> <br>The Bell boys laughed. Tom mimicked Zach, making his voice high-pitched. &#x201c;Leave off. Don&#x2019;t talk to my girlfriend.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, leave off,&#x201d; Nate squeaked. &#x201c;Or I&#x2019;ll beat you up with my doll.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alice started toward the Bell house, head down.<br> <br>Great, Zach thought. As usual, he&#x2019;d made it worse.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go yet,&#x201d; Poppy called to Alice, ignoring her brothers. &#x201c;Call home and just see if you can spend the night.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I better not,&#x201d; Alice said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just got to get my backpack from inside.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait up,&#x201d; Zach said, grabbing Lady Jaye. He headed for the screen door and got there just as it shut in his face. &#x201c;You forgot&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>The inside of Poppy&#x2019;s house was always a mess. Discarded clothes, half-empty cups, and sports equipment covered most surfaces. Her parents seemed to have given up on the house around the same time they gave up on trying to enforce any rules about dinners and bedtimes and fighting&#x2014;around Poppy&#x2019;s eighth birthday, when one of her brothers threw her cake with its still-lit birthday candles at her older sister. Now there were no more birthday parties. There weren&#x2019;t even family meals, just boxes of macaroni and cheese, cans of ravioli, and tins of sardines in the pantry so that the kids could feed themselves long before their parents came home from work and fell, exhausted, into their bed.<br> <br>Zach felt envious every time he thought of that kind of freedom, and Alice loved it even more than he did. She spent as many nights there as her grandmother allowed. Poppy&#x2019;s parents didn&#x2019;t seem to notice, which worked out pretty perfectly.<br> <br>He opened the screen door and went inside.<br> <br>Alice was standing in front of the dusty, old, locked display cabinet in the corner of the Bell living room, peering in at all the things Poppy&#x2019;s mother had forbidden Poppy, on pain of death and possible dismemberment, from touching. That was where the doll they called the Great Queen of all their kingdoms was trapped, next to a blown-glass vase from Savers that had turned out to be vintage something-or-other. The Queen had been picked up by Poppy&#x2019;s mother at a tag sale, and she insisted that one day she was going to go on Antiques Roadshow, sell it, and move them all to Tahiti.<br> <br>The Queen was a bone china doll of a child with straw-gold curls and paper-white skin. Her eyes were closed, lashes a flaxen fringe against her cheek. She wore a long gown, the thin fabric dotted with something black that might be mold. Zach couldn&#x2019;t remember when exactly they&#x2019;d decided that she was the Great Queen, only that they&#x2019;d all felt like she was watching them, even though her eyes were closed, and that Poppy&#x2019;s sister had been terrified of her.</p><h2>Helen in Egypt: Poetry (New Directions Paperbook)</h2><p><p><strong>A fifty-line fragment by the poet Stesichorus of Sicily (c. 640-555 B.C.), what survives of his Pallinode, tells us almost all we know of this other Helen, and from it H.

She financed H.D.&#x2019;s therapy with Freud.</p><h2>Sunshine on Scotland Street: 44 Scotland Street Series (8)</h2><p><b>44 SCOTLAND STREET - Book 8<br><br>The residents and neighbors of 44 Scotland Street and the city of Edinburgh come to vivid life in these gently satirical, wonderfully perceptive serial novels, featuring six-year-old Bertie, a remarkably precocious boy&#x2014;just ask his mother. &nbsp;</b><br><br>From social media to the finer points of human behavior, this episode of Alexander McCall Smith's popular 44 Scotland Street series provides an entertaining commentary on a small corner of modern life in Edinburgh where, contrary to received wisdom, the sun nearly always shines.<br><br>Angus Lordie and Domenica Macdonald are finally tying the knot. Unsurprisingly, Angus is not quite prepared and averting a wedding-day disaster falls to his best man, Matthew. When the newlyweds finally head off on their honeymoon, Angus's dog Cyril goes to stay with the Pollocks&#x2014;to the delight of one member of the family, and the utter despair of another. The long-suffering Bertie knows firsthand how stringent his mother's rules can be, and he resolves to help Cyril set off on an adventure. Meanwhile, Big Lou becomes a viral Internet sensation, and the incurable narcissist Bruce meets his match in the form of a doppelganger neighbor, who proposes a plan that could change both their lives.</p><p><b>ALEXANDER McCALL SMITH&nbsp;</b>is the author of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, the Isabel Dalhousie series, the Portuguese Irregular Verbs series, the 44 Scotland Street series, and the Corduroy Mansions series. He is professor emeritus of medical law at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and has served with many national and international organizations concerned with bioethics. He was born in what is now known as Zimbabwe and was a law professor at the University of Botswana. He lives in Scotland.&nbsp;Visit his website at&nbsp;www.alexandermccallsmith.com.1. Omert�, and Fascinators<br><br>Even if she had not been an anthropologist, Domenica Macdonald would have understood the very particular significance of weddings. Anthropologists &#x2013; and sociologists too, perhaps even more so &#x2013; often tell us what we already know, or what we expect to hear, or perhaps what we are not surprised to learn. And so we all know, as did Domenica, that weddings are far more than marriage ceremonies; we know that they are occasions for family stock-taking and catharsis; that they furnish opportunities for naked displays of emotion and unscheduled tears; that they are a stage for sartorial and social ostentation; that they are far from the simple public exchange of vows they appear to be.<br><br>These insights had been impressed upon Domenica decades earlier by a visiting professor, one Salvatore Santaluca of the Istituto-Antropologico-Sociologico-Culturale of the University of Palermo. Santaluca&#x2019;s study of the traditional marriage practices of the hill villages of Sicily was something of an anthropological classic, considered by some to be the equal of Margaret Mead&#x2019;s Coming of Age in Samoa, exposing the labyrinthine negotiations and discussions that preceded such weddings. Unfortunately, the publication of these details was viewed in some circles in Sicily as a breach of omert�, and the professor had some months later been shot in a restaurant in Messina, a crime that had yet to be solved, largely because those who were charged with investigating it were precisely the people who had committed it. Things had changed since then, of course, and the Italian state had tackled the criminal culture that had for so long blighted its southern regions; too late, though, for Santaluca and the various courageous Italian magistrates and policemen who had taken on the secretive bullies holding an entire state to ransom.<br><br>It rather surprised Domenica that she should suddenly think of poor Professor Santaluca after all these years. But it was quite understandable, really, that she should be contemplating the institution of marriage and its customs, given that she was herself about to get married &#x2013; to Angus Lordie &#x2013; and was now sitting in her flat in Scotland Street, attended by her friend, Big Lou, preparing for the moment &#x2013; only three hours away &#x2013; when she would walk through the door of St. Mary&#x2019;s Cathedral in Palmerston Place. Her entry would be to the accompaniment of &#x201c;Sheep May Safely Graze&#x201d; by Johann Sebastian Bach, this piece having been selected by Angus, who had a soft spot for Bach. Domenica had acceded to this provided that it would be her choice of music to be played as they left. That was Charles Marie Widor&#x2019;s Toccata, from his Symphony No. 5, a triumphant piece of music if ever there was one.<br><br>&#x201c;People will love it,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s such a statement.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of what?&#x201d; Angus had asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Of the fact that the marriage has definitely taken place,&#x201d; said Domenica. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a piece of music that admits of any . . . how should I put it? . . . uncertainty.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the opposite of peelie-wersh, I suppose.&#x201d;<br><br>Domenica was interested. As with many Scots expressions, the meaning of peelie-wersh was obvious, even to those who had never encountered the term before. &#x201c;And which composers would be peelie-wersh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Some of the minimalists. The ones who use two or three notes. The ones you have to strain to hear. Thin music. Widor is thickly textured.&#x201d;<br><br>They had moved on to discuss the hymns. Domenica felt vaguely uncomfortable when it came to hymns. She understood why people sang them &#x2013; they performed a vital bonding function and undoubtedly buoyed the spirits &#x2013; but she felt that the words rarely bore close examination, mostly being rather sentimental and somewhat repetitive. There were exceptions, of course: the words of &#x201c;For Those in Peril on the Sea&#x201d; were cogent and to the point. It was entirely reasonable, she felt, particularly in an age of global warming and rising sea levels, to express the desire that &#x201c;the mighty ocean deep / Its own appointed limits keep.&#x201d; But could one sing that at a wedding? One might at a mariner&#x2019;s nuptials, perhaps, but neither she nor Angus were sailors. And then there was &#x201c;Fight the Good Fight&#x201d; which again had a perfectly clear message, but was clearly inappropriate for a wedding service, unless, of course, it was that of a pugilist, in which case the words would be taken as referring to professional rather than marital conflicts. &#x201c;Jerusalem&#x201d; was inspirational but referred to England, rather than to Scotland, and would seem quite out of place in a Scottish wedding. &#x201c;Jerusalem&#x201d; was inappropriate, too, Domenica felt, because right at its opening it asked a question to which the answer was almost certainly no. Its first line, stirring and dramatic though it may be, &#x201c;And did those feet in ancient times . . .&#x201d; invited the firm answer No, they certainly did not, words which could perhaps be set to music to be sung as a descant by the choir.<br><br>Angus had not been particularly helpful in his suggestions. He had himself composed the words of a hymn some time ago when he had offered to the hymn revision committee of the Church of Scotland a composition called &#x201c;God Looks Down on Belgium.&#x201d; The opening words of this hymn, however, proved to be not quite what the committee wanted: &#x201c;God&#x2019;s never heard of Belgium / But loves it just the same / For God is kind and doesn&#x2019;t mind / He&#x2019;s not impressed with fame.&#x201d; The second verse was even more unsuitable, making reference to Captain Haddock and Tintin, both of whom, it was felt, had no place in a modern, or any, hymn book.<br><br>&#x201c;You do remember that I wrote a hymn called &#x2018;God Looks Down on Belgium&#x2019;?&#x201d; said Angus.<br><br>Domenica gave him a warning glance. &#x201c;I do indeed, Angus, and we are certainly not having that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pity. I always rather liked it.&#x201d;<br><br>Now, sitting at her dressing table, while Big Lou attempted to fix on the fascinator she had acquired at great expense from a milliner in Fife &#x2013; &#x201c;One hundred and eighty pounds for four feathers!&#x201d; Big Lou had exclaimed &#x2013; Domenica remembered her first wedding. That had been so different. It had taken place in India, in Kerala, where she had married the eldest son of a Cochin mercantile family and had become for a brief time Mrs. Varghese.<br><br>That wedding, like many Indian weddings, had lasted for days, with legions of relatives and friends coming from all over India and beyond. It had not been a particularly happy marriage and was very brief, her husband being electrocuted in the small electricity factory owned by his family. She regretted him, but, if she was honest with herself, she did not miss him unduly; nor did she miss her former mother-in-law. Angus came with no family baggage of that sort &#x2013; except for his dog Cyril.<br><br>Domenica knew that she was taking on Cyril, but felt that given a choice &#x2013; between an impossible mother-in-law or a dog &#x2013; many might choose the latter . . . discreetly, of course.<br><br>2. Late Climbers<br><br>&#x201c;Does it really matter what I wear?&#x201d; asked Domenica. &#x201c;This obsession with the bride&#x2019;s outfit is understandable when the bride is twenty-something, but in my case . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Everybody will be just as interested,&#x201d; said Big Lou, still struggling with the fascinator she was attempting to pin into Domenica&#x2019;s hair. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter how old the bride is . . . not that you&#x2019;re all that old, Domenica.&#x201d;<br><br>She was not quite sure how old Domenica was. Forty-five? A bit more? Or less, perhaps? And Angus was difficult to date too: in some lights he looked as if he was barely into his forties; in others, he looked considerably older. He was one of those people who could have been anything.<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose age adds character,&#x201d; said Domenica. &#x201c;Or so we can console ourselves.&#x201d; She looked in the mirror. It would have been ridiculous to wear a conventional bridal dress. It would have been mutton dressed up as lamb, she thought &#x2013; a metaphor that would mean less and less as people forgot about the distinction. Where could one buy mutton these days? It seemed more or less to have dis��appeared; everything, it seemed, was lamb because lambs presumably did not have the chance to reach muttonhood. So the expression would go, and the language would be further impoverished. Tell that not in Gath. That had gone completely by now, as had the habit of piling Pelion upon Ossa. Or making it to the altar. To the what? a contemporary teenager might be expected to ask. Down the aisle. Down the what?<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Big Lou through lips pursed to hold two hairpins. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t be doing with those smooth faces that you see on film stars. You know the sort? All smooth &#x2013; no lines. Nothing that shows us where the face has been.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A few lines,&#x201d; agreed Domenica. &#x201c;But one would hardly like to look too much like a prune.&#x201d; She paused. The fascinator was not going to hold; she was sure of it. &#x201c;Or like W. H. Auden.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The loon with the wrinkly face?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. His face was described as looking like a wedding cake left out in the rain.&#x201d;<br><br>Big Lou laughed. &#x201c;It was a good face.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. He referred to it as a geological catastrophe. And of course he smoked, which must have made it worse. The kippering effect.&#x201d; She paused again. &#x201c;You know something, Lou? I feel slightly embarrassed about all this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;About getting married?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. I just don&#x2019;t know . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Big Lou laid a hand on her shoulder. &#x201c;Haud your wheesht! It&#x2019;s fine getting married at your age, for goodness&#x2019; sake. You&#x2019;re still a spring chicken compared with some.&#x201d;<br><br>Spring chicken, thought Domenica: another meat metaphor. So much of our language is still based on the things we used to do &#x2013; like knowing where food came from. It was good of Big Lou, of course, but the fact remained: this was a late wedding.<br><br>&#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s changed when it comes to age,&#x201d; Big Lou went on reassuringly. &#x201c;Remember how people used to give up early? Remember how our parents&#x2019; generation behaved? They put on carpet slippers when they were in their fifties. They did, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was going to agree,&#x201d; said Domenica. &#x201c;I was thinking of my father. He retired from the Bank of Scotland when he was fifty-six and he stopped driving at the same time. He said he was too old. Whereas today . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;People run marathons at seventy.&#x201d;<br><br>Domenica nodded, inadvertently loosening the fascinator. &#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Keep your head still,&#x201d; muttered Big Lou. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to have to do it again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And they climb Everest, or try to, in their seventies.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s going too far,&#x201d; said Big Lou. &#x201c;But you can certainly take fifteen years off everything these days.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;But you can&#x2019;t take height off a mountain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So forty is the new . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Twenty-five. And fifty is the new thirty-five. It&#x2019;s all a question of attitude.&#x201d;<br><br>Domenica smiled. &#x201c;So I shouldn&#x2019;t feel embarrassed about getting married at . . . at the age I am?&#x201d;<br><br>Big Lou finished with the fascinator. &#x201c;No. And that bunnet, if you can call it that &#x2013; that wee bawbee&#x2019;s worth of over-priced feathers isn&#x2019;t going to move now.&#x201d;<br><br>Domenica felt at the delicate construction: it seemed firmly embedded. &#x201c;Thank you, Lou. And thank you for being my bridesmaid.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Two auld hens together,&#x201d; said Big Lou.<br><br>Domenica stood up and allowed Lou to smooth out her dress. She had chosen silver-grey Thai silk that had been made into a strikingly smart suit. Grey T-bar high-heel shoes completed the picture of elegance.<br><br>She looked at Lou. &#x201c;Do you think I&#x2019;m doing the right thing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Marrying Angus? Of course I do. I wouldn&#x2019;t have agreed to be bridesmaid if I didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose not,&#x201d; mused Domenica. &#x201c;Can you imagine a bridesmaid who fundamentally disapproved of the groom? She&#x2019;d have to stand there and shake her head ominously as the service went ahead. And perhaps the occasional glance at the congregation to say, Not my doing, any of this.&#x201d;<br><br>Big Lou smiled. &#x201c;Well, I have no reservations in this case. Except maybe . . .&#x201d; She stopped herself, but it was too late.<br><br>Domenica looked at her anxiously. &#x201c;Except what, Lou?&#x201d;<br><br>Lou shook her head. &#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, Lou, you can&#x2019;t say &#x2018;except that&#x2019; and then leave it at that.&#x201d;<br><br>Big Lou looked down at the floor. &#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s just that . . . well, about a year or so ago when Angus was in the coffee bar, he left his briefcase behind. You know that leather thing he carries . . . Well, he left it and I took it behind the counter to look after it for him and an envelope fell out.&#x201d; She stared at Domenica. &#x201c;There was a typed name and address on it and I couldn&#x2019;t help but notice it as I picked it up.&#x201d;<br><br>Domenica held her breath. &#x201c;Go on.&#x201d;<br><br>Big Lou lowered her voice. &#x201c;The envelope was addressed to Mrs. A. Lordie. That&#x2019;s what it said. Mrs. A. Lordie, and it had his address on it. Drummond Place.&#x201d;<br><br>Domenica stood quite still. She said nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;So I thought: is Angus already married?&#x201d;<br><br>Domenica sat down heavily. The fascinator fell off; the feathers came into their own and it floated gently to the floor, where it lay, a small insubstantial thing, a vanity.<br><br>Drummond Place, where Angus Lordie lived, and where, like Domenica, he was now dressing for his wedding, was at the top of Scotland Street. The flat that Angus occupied also served as his studio, and was on the opposite side of the square from the Scotland Street entrance; not that Drummond Place was really a square &#x2013; parts of it looked as if they belonged to a square, while others were semicircular. It was, he thought, a circle that had run out of architectural room, and had been obliged to draw in its skirts and become a sort of U-topped semi-rectangle; either that, or it had been the work of two architects, one starting at one end in the belief that they were to build a square, and another starting at the other end under the firm impression Drummond Place was to be a circle, or circus. If that is what happened &#x2013; and of course that was just a fantasy &#x2013; then Angus imagined the moment of the meeting of the two sides, a moment of trigonometrical tension, no doubt.<br><br>Of course buildings can be made to join together without too much difficulty &#x2013; a bit more stone here and there and one has the necessary coming together; how much more difficult it must be for those builders of bridges who start on opposite banks simultaneously. These must meet in the middle, and meet exactly: even a few inches can be a problem, and to miss by yards would be disastrous: no bridge should have a traffic circle or junction in the middle. And as for tunnels: how fortunate it was that the builders of the Channel Tunnel got it right and met, as planned, in the middle.</p><h2>Pillsbury The Big Book Of More Baking With Refrigerated Dough (Betty Crocker Big Book)</h2><p><b>Inspiring and delicious recipes from appetizers to desserts, all made super-easy with Pillsbury&#x2019;s ready-to-use dough</b><br><br><i>Pillsbury More Baking with Refrigerated Dough</i>, a delectable follow-up to the best-selling <i>Pillsbury The Big Book of Easy Baking with Refrigerated Dough</i>, features 160 wow-worthy recipes&#x2014;each with a full-color photo&#x2014;that make baking a breeze with prepared doughs like biscuits, pie crust, and pizza dough.

In <i>Mind and World</i>, based on the 1991 John Locke Lectures, one of the most distinguished philosophers writing today offers his diagnosis of this difficulty and points to a cure. In doing so, he delivers the most complete and ambitious statement to date of his own views, a statement that no one concerned with the future of philosophy can afford to ignore.</p><p>John McDowell amply illustrates a major problem of modern philosophy--the insidious persistence of dualism--in his discussion of empirical thought. Much as we would like to conceive empirical thought as rationally grounded in experience, pitfalls await anyone who tries to articulate this position, and McDowell exposes these traps by exploiting the work of contemporary philosophers from Wilfrid Sellars to Donald Davidson. These difficulties, he contends, reflect an understandable--but surmountable--failure to see how we might integrate what Sellars calls the logical space of reasons" into the natural world. What underlies this impasse is a conception of nature that has certain attractions for the modern age, a conception that McDowell proposes to put aside, thus circumventing these philosophical difficulties. By returning to a pre-modern conception of nature but retaining the intellectual advance of modernity that has mistakenly been viewed as dislodging it, he makes room for a fully satisfying conception of experience as a rational openness to independent reality. This approach also overcomes other obstacles that impede a generally satisfying understanding of how we are placed in the world.</p></p><p>John McDowell is University Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh.&#x201c;Ever since Descartes, a lot of the very best philosophers have thought of science as an invading army from whose depredations safe havens have somehow to be constructed. Philosophy patrols the borders, keeping the sciences "intellectually respectable" by keeping them "within...proper bounds." But you have to look outside these bounds if what you care about is the life of the spirit or the life of the mind. McDowell's is as good a contemporary representative of this kind of philosophical sensibility as you could hope to find.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jerry Fodor</b><b>, </b><b><i>London Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A powerfully impressive book which simply towers over the more routine contributions of current analytical philosophy.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Simon Glendinning</b><b>, </b><b><i>Radical Philosophy</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;McDowell locates an important tension in our thinking about thought, suggests an attractive way of easing the tension, and offers a plausible diagnosis of why the tension is acute...<i>Mind and World</i> is a genuinely provocative book that should be discussed.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Paul M.

Only in the last decade have counselors acknowledged that children grieve too, and that unresolved issues can negatively impact children into adulthood. Unaddressed grief can lead to depression, substance abuse, and relationship difficulties. For at least three generations of adults, these issues have been largely ignored. </p><p>Having worked with thousands of families as Executive Director of the Dougy Center for Grieving Children, Donna Schuurman understands the dangers of unresolved grief better than anyone else. In <i>Never the Same</i>, Schuurman offers expert advice and encouragement to empower readers to reflect on their unique situation, come to terms with the influence of their parent's death, and live more healthful, peaceful lives.</p><p>The only book of its kind<i>, Never the Same</i> is an essential companion for those still struggling with the early loss of a parent.</p></p><p>Time does not heal all wounds, warns grief counselor Donna Schuurman in her brave and practical book about the challenges adults face in coming to terms with the loss of a parent before age 18. Her premise in <i>Never the Same</i> defies the common wisdom. "Forget the stages of grief. There is no magical moment when you can say, it&#x2019;s over." Using thoughtful self-assessments and examples, Schuurman persuades readers that grief must be reprocessed at every stage of life. First, she invites readers to look backward, examining their reactions and coping strategies at the time of their parent&#x2019;s death. Moving into the present, she asks, what meaning do your make of your parent&#x2019;s death as an adult? Schuurman details the high cost of unresolved grieving, including depression, anxiety, pessimism, underachievement, and troubled relationships. She then outlines suggestions for dealing with the legacy of a parent&#x2019;s death and choosing healthy traditions for remembering. Adults and parents will find this a wise and compassionate book&#x2014;-an indispensable guide to the unfinished business of losing a parent at an early age. <i>--Barbara Mackoff</i><p><b>Donna Schuurman</b> speaks regularly in national venues in her role as Executive Director of The Dougy Center for Grieving Children (Portland, OR), the first peer grief support program in the world for children, teens, and families.

He uses the comparative method to reconstruct traditional poetic formulae of considerable complexity that stretch as far back as the original common language. Thus, Watkins reveals the antiquity and tenacity of the Indo-European poetic tradition.<br><br>Watkins begins this study with an introduction to the field of <em>comparative Indo-European poetics</em>; he explores the Saussurian notions of synchrony and diachrony, and locates the various Indo-European traditions and ideologies of the spoken word. Further, his overview presents case studies on the forms of verbal art, with selected texts drawn from Indic, Iranian, Greek, Latin, Hittite, Armenian, Celtic, and Germanic languages.<br> <br>In the remainder of the book, Watkins examines in detail the structure of the dragon/serpent-slaying myths, which recur in various guises throughout the Indo-European poetic tradition. He finds the "signature" formula for the myth--the divine hero who slays the serpent or overcomes adversaries--occurs in the same linguistic form in a wide range of sources and over millennia, including Old and Middle Iranian holy books, Greek epic, Celtic and Germanic sagas, down to Armenian oral folk epic of the last century. Watkins argues that this formula is the vehicle for the central theme of a proto-text, and a central part of the symbolic culture of speakers of the Proto-Indo-European language: the relation of humans to their universe, the values and expectations of their society. Therefore, he further argues, poetry was a social necessity for Indo- European society, where the poet could confer on patrons what they and their culture valued above all else: "imperishable fame."<br></p><p>In How to Kill a Dragon Calvert Watkins follows the continuum of poetic formulae in Indo-European languages, from Old Hittite to medieval Irish.

It matters to them&#x2015;and to all of us.</b></p><br><br><p>***</p><br><br><p>Today&#x2019;s early childhood educators are looking for education models for the twenty-first century&#x2015;models that tap into each child&#x2019;s full learning potential and educate all children toward active participation in democracy. Tracing the historical roots of progressive education, and using anecdotes and case studies, Dan Gartrell argues that best practices in early childhood education, which include family-teacher partnerships, developmentally appropriate curriculum and assessment, and guidance, provide the framework for what the new education model for all levels of schooling should be: educating children for civil participation in society.</p><br><br><p>Through the use of guidance, Gartrell explains, teachers empower children to progress toward the five democratic life skills. These skills give young children the tools they need to function intelligently and ethically amidst the complexity and diversity of modern human life&#x2015;and to ensure and sustain civil society into the next century.</p></p><p><p>Dan Gartrell started his career in education as a teacher at an inner-city elementary school in Ohio and later taught in the Head Start program of the Red Lake Band of Ojibwe in Minnesota. He holds a doctorate in teacher education/early childhood and is Professor Emeritus of Early Childhood and Foundations Education at Bemidji State University in Minnesota. As former director of Bemidji&#x2019;s Child Development Training Program, a CDA trainer, and a student teaching supervisor, he has helped scores of students start their journey to becoming excellent educators.</p><br><br><p>Once introduced at a conference as &#x201c;the guidance guy,&#x201d; Dan has spoken extensively on using guidance with young children and related topics. He writes the Guidance Matters column in NAEYC&#x2019;s journal, Young Children, and has contributed several additional articles to the journal. The sixth edition of his textbook on guidance, A Guidance Approach for the Encouraging Classroom, will be forthcoming in 2013. Dan has also written The Power of Guidance: Teaching Social-Emotional Skills to Young Children and What the Kids Said Today. Dan and his wife, Dr. Julie Jochum, live in Minnesota. The 11 grandchildren in their blended family know Dan as the grandpa who tells friendly jokes and makes pretty good &#x201c;papadanpancakes&#x201d; (the secret is strawberry yogurt in the batter). He enjoys nature photography and being outdoors in the north woods and on the lake near Bemidji, Minnesota.</p>For a long-lasting solution to the issue of incivility in modern life, it is time to look anew at the social and cultural purposes of schooling. Education that prepares the whole child for modern, democratic society incorporates the best practices of early childhood education. Under the umbrella term popularized by NAEYC, developmentally appropriate practice (see Copple &amp; Bredekamp 2009), three aspects essential in meeting the needs of all children are particularly relevant to promoting the democratic life skills:<br><br>- Reciprocal and respectful family-teacher partnerships<br><br>- Curriculum and teaching methods aligned with principles of child (and brain) development<br><br>- Teacher-child interactions and relationships that guide children toward prosocial behaviors (the practice of guidance as opposed to discipline)</p><h2>Impro for Storytellers</h2><p><em>Impro for Storytellers</em> is the follow-up to Keith Johnstone's classic <em>Impro</em>, one of the best-selling books ever published on improvisation. <em>Impro for Storytellers</em> aims to take jealous and self-obsessed beginners and teach them to play games with good nature and to fail gracefully.</p><p><strong>Keith Johnstone</strong> worked at the Royal Court Theatre in the 1960s where he developed his techniques for improvisational work.

You can use it to talk about all sorts of things&#x2014;from your new labradoodle puppy to the expansive gardens at Versailles, from Roger Federer&#x2019;s backhand to things that don&#x2019;t exist at all, like flying pigs. And when you talk, your listener fills in lots of details you didn&#x2019;t mention&#x2014;the curliness of the dog&#x2019;s fur or the vast statuary on the grounds of the French palace. What&#x2019;s the trick behind this magic? How does meaning work?&nbsp;In <i>Louder than Words</i>, cognitive scientist Benjamin Bergen draws together a decade&#x2019;s worth of research in psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience to offer a new theory of how our minds make meaning. When we hear words and sentences, Bergen contends, we engage the parts of our brain that we use for perception and action, repurposing these evolutionarily older networks to create simulations in our minds. These embodied simulations, as they're called, are what makes it possible for us to become better baseball players by merely visualizing a well-executed swing; what allows us to remember which cupboard the diapers are in without looking, and what makes it so hard to talk on a cell phone while we&#x2019;re driving on the highway. Meaning is more than just knowing definitions of words, as others have previously argued. In understanding language, our brains engage in a creative process of constructing rich mental worlds in which we see, hear, feel, and act.&nbsp;Through whimsical examples and ingenious experiments, Bergen leads us on a virtual tour of the new science of embodied cognition. A brilliant account of our human capacity to understand language, <i>Louder than Words</i> will profoundly change how you read, speak, and listen.<br></p><p><b>Benjamin Bergen</b> is an Associate Professor in the Cognitive Science Department at the University of California, San Diego, where he directs the Language and Cognition Lab.

Ben Bergen shows us that the link between sentences and meanings is ongoing mental simulations the same kinds that allow us to picture how we are going to build that birdhouse or clean out that garage, except that we actually do them, day and night.&nbsp;For those who think linguists are professional grammar police, this book shows the kind of thing linguists actually study, especially promising ones like Bergen who we will surely hear more from in the future.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Nature</i></b><br> [An] impressive debut....

Stone and fellow patriot talk show host Alex jokes undoubtly propelled President Trump's campaign to a historical victory. Amazing! Stone called it all the way to the end! No wonder the mainstream media didn't want him on their airwaves. Must have for all Trump fans or for anyone wanting to breakout of the left/right controlled media/political paradigm."&#x2014;<b>AnalogElvis</b><br><br>"Roger Stone had both the rare opportunity to be at the start of the Trump Revolution and the prescience to record it for posterity. I applaud Mr. Stone on his long career culminating in his participation in one of the greatest political upsets in history. Hat's off to you Mr. Stone!"&#x2014;<b>Franklin Brothers</b><br><br>"Roger's books are always an engaging and informative read. This might be his best yet. His longtime professional and personal relationship with Trump makes this the AUTHENTIC tale of 2016 and DJT's longtime presidential ambitions. Stone has been with Trump the entire way. Beware of other books from people claiming to "know" Trump. Looking forward to Stone's next project."&#x2014;<b>Jack Southerlin</b><br><br>"Wow. I have to say this is the ultimate Trump book! Roger Stone gives behind the scene details of what happened in the Trump campaign and why he won. I would recommend this book to both the Trump supporter and political news junkie."&#x2014;<b>AmericanPatriot</b><br><br>"Surprisingly, this book reaches across the political aisle. Roger certainly doesn't fear controversy - and that shows in his new book. While I don't necessarily agree with many of his political positions/views, THE MAKING OF THE PRESIDENT 2016 is a well-written, compelling political analysis of truly one of the greatest political upsets of all time. While many right-leaning individuals may seek out this book as validation for their views; liberals and left-leaners alike can learn a lot from Roger's insights and analysis. Especially considering how divided our country is at present, it is of paramount importance to acknowledge and respect opposing viewpoints. To that end, I would recommend this book to anyone - regardless of political affiliation."&#x2014;<b>Amazon Customer</b><br><br>"This is an important book written by Roger Stone -- a seasoned (famous/infamous) political operative and a long-time trusted Trump adviser. If you want to understand how Trump thinks, how he calculates politically, you MUST read ROGER STONE's book. MAKING OF THE PRESIDENT 2016 is also very entertaining -- Roger Stone relates his time with Trump over decades, recalling conversations and previous Trump presidential campaigns -- even how one day he saved Donald Trump's life. Stone gives you an INSIDER'S VIEW of Trump's campaign -- from Trump's announcement of his candidacy until election night 2016, when Trump finally achieved the presidency he has sought since the 1990s. The book also presents a brilliant analysis of Hillary Clinton and her campaign, and the "Silent Majority" ignored by Hollywood and the mainstream media elites in LA and NYC that elected Trump. If you want to understand why and how HILLARY LOST, the strategy Stone implemented DAY ONE to get Trump into the White House. The truth is Roger Stone never quit supporting Trump -- even when he officially left the campaign. Handing the position of campaign manager to others, Stone strategically positioned himself as "an outsider," much as Trump positioned himself as an "outsider." Stone calculated the move to give him more leverage over the media -- while remaining in constant touch with Trump and key officers in Trump's campaign -- including Paul Manafort -- Stone's long-time political consulting partner. Using the MAKING OF THE PRESIDENT format Theodore H. White made famous, STONE takes the reader through the campaign -- from the primaries, through the presidential debates, and the closing rallies -- weaving a chronological commentary peppered with insightful insights. I truly enjoyed this book and I recommend it to you enthusiastically. If you want to understand modern presidential politics, I strongly urge you to read Roger Stone's MAKING OF THE PRESIDENT 2016."&#x2014;<b>Jerome R. Corsi</b><br><br>"As someone who lived parts of this journey with the author, I can say with confidence that his perspective and knowledge of the general subject matter and of course the principal himself is unparalleled. There will be hundreds of books on this subject, but only a handful will be legit. This, friends, is solidly in the latter category."&#x2014;<b>Christian Josi</b><br><br>"Roger Stone is a true Donald Trump insider. [His] book does a great job outlining the timing and tactics that Trump used to pull off one of the biggest upsets in election history! What Trump has accomplished and Stone documented is truly a revolution."&#x2014;<b>elias</b></p><h2>Contagious: A Novel (The Infected)</h2><p>From the acclaimed author of <i>Infected</i> comes an epic and exhilarating story of humanity&#x2019;s secret battle against a horrific enemy. <br><br>Across America, a mysterious pathogen transforms ordinary people into raging killers, psychopaths driven by a terrifying, alien agenda. The human race fights back, yet after every battle the disease responds, adapts, using sophisticated strategies and brilliant ruses to fool its pursuers. The only possible explanation: the epidemic is driven not by evolution but by some malevolent intelligence.<br><br>Standing against this unimaginable threat is a small group, assembled under the strictest secrecy. Their best weapon is hulking former football star Perry Dawsey, left psychologically shattered by his own struggles with this terrible enemy, who possesses an unexplainable ability to locate the disease&#x2019;s hosts. Violent and unpredictable, Perry is both the nation&#x2019;s best hope and a terrifying liability. Hardened CIA veteran Dew Phillips must somehow forge a connection with him if they&#x2019;re going to stand a chance against this maddeningly adaptable opponent. Alongside them is Margaret Montoya, a brilliant epidemiologist who fights for a cure even as she reels under the weight of endless horrors. <br><br>These three and their team have kept humanity in the game, but that&#x2019;s not good enough anymore, not when the disease turns contagious, triggering a fast countdown to Armageddon. Meanwhile, other enemies join the battle, and a new threat &#x2014; one that comes from a most unexpected source &#x2014; may ultimately prove the most dangerous of all.<br><br>Catapulting the reader into a world where humanity&#x2019;s life span is measured in hours and the president&#x2019;s finger hovers over the nuclear button, rising star Scott Sigler takes us on a breathtaking, hyper-adrenalized ride filled with terror and jaw-dropping action. <i>Contagious</i> is a truly grand work of suspense, science, and horror from a new master.</p><p>SCOTT SIGLER&#x2019;s fiction podcasts have drawn a huge and devoted following. His serialized stories have held the number one position in all the podcast indexes, including iTunes. Scott&#x2019;s first hardcover release, <i>Infected</i>, was translated into a dozen languages and is being adapted for film by Random House Films/Rogue Pictures. Scott lives in San Francisco with his wife and their dog.Scott Sigler&#39;s story is contagious--the more you listen, the more you want to hear. Though Sigler&#39;s narration isn&#39;t as spectacular as his writing, he has a pleasant, logical-sounding voice. In particular, he knows what&#39;s coming and can vary his voice accordingly. However, he&#39;s not skilled at differentiating characters, and his young-sounding voice stretches credibility when performing the older characters, such as the U.S. president. Like some of Robin Cook&#39;s plots, this story is about the attempt to identify and eradicate a disease that attacks humans, turning them into psychopathic killers. Not only are they violent, but the malefactors seem to have superintelligence, anticipating every move to stop them. Along with Sigler, listeners will whisk through this thriller, with anticipation of another of this genre from the author.

The question is not, Will we have families? but, What will our families be like? For better or worse, the family is the primary means by which values are taught, morality is established, and sense of identity is formed. Our government invests billions of dollars each year in the future of our nation through programs that primarily affect children outside the home; meanwhile, the family unit is under attack and is, in many cases, fragmented and without purpose. Studies have shown that one of the main reasons for the breakdown of our families is a lack of proper leadership in the home, especially by husbands and fathers. We might well amend our initial statement to read, &#39;As the father goes, so goes the family, and so goes the nation.&#39; If the church is to be an effective witness and influence in our nation, we must focus our attention on the condition of the family and its leadership. In other words, we must turn our efforts to the development of effective husbands and fathers. This is the greatest opportunity and challenge facing the church in the twenty-first century, because government social programs will never be able to capture men&#39;s hearts and mentor them into becoming responsible leaders of their homes. Unfortunately, most local churches do not know how to train men to be productive leaders. In many congregations, the normal process is for a man to get saved and then be rushed into a ministry position before he is ready. To be effective, however, he must first be trained to lead himself and his family before he can successfully lead the church. The church has a responsibility to teach men how to be spiritual leaders. The State of Our Nation&#39;s Men Men in our society---including Christian men and pastors---are caught in a web of deception about their masculinity. As counselor Alexander Mitserlisch postulates, &#39;Society has torn the soul of the male, and into this tear the demons have fled---the demons of insecurity, selfishness and despair. Consequently, men do not know who they are as men. Rather, they define themselves by what they do, who they know, or by what they own.&#39; Many men today feel isolated. Studies have shown that most men over thirty do not have close friends. They have colleagues and work associates, golf partners, and maybe a &#39;couples&#39; friend or two, with whom the bond is really between the wives. If they say that they do have a best friend, often it turns out to be a childhood buddy they talk to occasionally or visit every few years. In a 1993 survey, Dr. Gary Rossberg identified the following influences on men in our society:1 Regrettably, for most men in our culture, male friendship is a relic of the past. One man spoke for many when he said, &#39;I haven&#39;t made a new friend in twenty-five years.&#39; This estrangement of men in our culture results in part from a societal standard that discourages true friendships between men. We&#39;ve been taught to protect ourselves by keeping our adult relationships within certain &#39;safe&#39; parameters. A close companionship between two males who are not relatives is often seen as suspicious or unhealthy. Society has convinced us that a relationship like that of Jonathan and David in the Old Testament is impossible. Current Beliefs among Nonchurchgoers According to George Barna, most men who are not involved with a church believe that the church does not offer any lasting value to their lives. The typical adult male in our society is more likely to spend his Sundays watching sports on TV than attending a church service. A majority of unchurched men believe that participating in church life cannot be justified because the return on their investment of time, attention, and energy is too slim. Despite the negative feedback, Barna also identified seven key factors that unchurched men said would draw them to the church. These factors define the window of opportunity that lies open to the church and sets the parameters for effective men&#39;s ministry.2 1.Men are looking for meaning and purpose in life. 2.Men are seeking understanding of who they are and what they are thinking. 3.Men want solutions to their everyday problems and difficulties. 4.Men want to know God---who he is and what he means to them. 5.Men want effective men&#39;s ministry that touches them where they are. 6.Men want friendships that are built on trust and that will last. 7.Men want help with family issues, especially training for their children. If our ministry to men is going to be successful, we must develop a system that will help men to form significant and lasting friendships. Without vital relationships between our men, too many men will continue to feel lonely, isolated, and without hope. When building our ministry, we must focus primarily on establishing relationships, not on developing programs. A successful ministry to men will encompass the following key components of a man&#39;s life: identity, friendship, God&#39;s calling, discipline, marriage and family skills, and stewardship. Identity. God has placed into each man a longing to be significant, a need to feel that his life counts. Countless men feel inadequate and insecure, no matter how much talent they possess. A man needs to learn how to find his identity in Christ. And every man needs a sense of purpose. Without a godly purpose in life, a man is left to measure his significance and his success by what he owns, what he achieves, and what he controls. The problem with finding his self-worth in his position, possessions, or power is that if he loses his job, his house, or his influence, a man also loses his self-respect. Friendship. Most men know a lot of people by name or by acquaintance. Conversations with these individuals are light, brief, and nonthreatening. Even in the church, very few men have close friends. For the most part, men are spiritually fed but relationally bankrupt. Ask a group of men to identify their greatest needs, and most of them would respond with the need for close male friendships. The need for intimate, trusting relationships with other men proves to be a compelling need, regardless of race or culture.</p><h2>Genesis Of A Music: An Account Of A Creative Work, Its Roots, And Its Fulfillments, Second Edition</h2><p>Among the few truly experimental composers in our cultural history, Harry Partch's life (1901-1974) and music embody most completely the quintessential American rootlessness, isolation, pre-civilized cult of experience, and dichotomy of practical invention and transcendental visions. Having lived mostly in the remote deserts of Arizona and New Mexico with no access to formal training, Partch naturally created theatrical ritualistic works incorporating Indian chants, Japanese kabuki and Noh, Polynesian microtones, Balinese gamelan, Greek tragedy, dance, mime, and sardonic commentary on Hollywood and commercial pop music of modern civilization. First published in 1949, <i>Genesis of a Music</i> is the manifesto of Partch's radical compositional practice and instruments (which owe nothing to the 300-year-old European tradition of Western music.) He contrasts Abstract and Corporeal music, proclaiming the latter as the vital, emotionally tactile form derived from the spoken word (like Greek, Chinese, Arabic, and Indian musics) and surveys the history of world music at length from this perspective. Parts II, III, and IV explain Partch's theories of scales, intonation, and instrument construction with copious acoustical and mathematical documentation. Anyone with a musically creative attitude, whether or not familiar with traditional music theory, will find this book revelatory.</p><p>&#39;Harry Partch&#39;s pioneering theoretical investigations of tuning and his practical application of these investigations to instruments of his own construction show him to be a composer of remarkable and enduring individuality. Partch&#39;s perseverance without widespread support or recognition during most of his lifetime has always struck me as particularly courageous.&#39;--Steve Reich<b>Harry Partch</b> (1901-1974) was an American composer, music theorist, and creator of musical instruments. He composed using scales of unequal intervals in just intonation, and was one of the first twentieth-century composers in the West to work systematically with microtonal scales.</p><h2>Bramton Wick</h2><p><p><i>She wondered how Lady Masters got her old parlour maid to carry the coffee right across the lawn.

There her father was the land agent for Haigh Hall, then occupied by the Earl of Crawford and Balcorres, and there she and her sister were educated by a governess. After her father&#39;s death, in 1934, Miss Fair and her mother and sister removed to a small house with a large garden in the New Forest in Hampshire. From 1939 to 1944, she was an ambulance driver in the Civil Defence Corps, serving at Southampton, England; in 1944 she joined the British Red Cross and went overseas as a Welfare Officer, during which time she served in Belgium, India, and Ceylon. Miss Fair&#39;s first novel, Bramton Wick, was published in 1952 and received with enthusiastic acclaim as &#39;perfect light reading with a dash of lemon in it . . .&#39; by Time and Tide. Between the years 1953 and 1960, five further novels followed: Landscape in Sunlight, The Native Heath, Seaview House, A Winter Away, and The Mingham Air. All are characterized by their English countryside settings and their shrewd and witty study of human nature.

Is there nothing to remember with gratitude in all that?<br><br>What if grief came afterwards; long days and nights of heart breaking grief that only God knows of, [when I was] so heart broken that even God seemed so far off that prayers could not reach him; all the days of my life had been unclouded happiness, without pain or sadness until that awful night when I looked at mother's stony, horror struck face as she lay on the floor with father kneeling over her, and heard her cry out to me with that unnatural voice "Harry is dead! You loved him Sarah!" And my soul seemed to expand in one vast world of agony and then I laughed and said "Father, it is not true! tell her so!" Then as he lifted up his face all tearstained [p. 2] -- my dear old father! -- and said -- "It is true, dear" my heart fairly stopped beating -- and I knew or saw nothing more until I heard his voice saying "My child, for God's sake control yourself!"<br><br>It called me back from I know not where; some place that I remember now as being void of everything except awful darkness; and when I saw his face dimly through the veil that seemed wrapped around me, and remembered what he was suffering, with one gasp I conquered something that was dragging me into that dark nothing again, and crept close to mother to help father to hold her. Then, for the first time I knew what grief was. But I had always been so happy until then! "Shall we receive good at the hand of the Lord, and shall we not receive evil also?"<br><br>O that dreary night! Presently I found myself in the street. A crowd was gathered at the gate, but I passed through and ran on to where I knew I would find Miriam. I remember putting my arms around her and saying "Miriam, my Harry is dead!" and then we were in the street again, I dont know how -- and presently some one's hand was on my arm and some one said "Hush!" -- I know not why -- but I threw off the hand and ran away; they had no right to hold me; it was <i>my</i> brother that was dead, the one I loved best of all.<br><br>People were in the house gathering around mother; they took Miriam too; but I shook them off, for one [p. 3] word or one touch would unnerve me, and I must be brave for father's sake. They said I must go to Lilly and some one took me there where people were standing around her too, and when I saw her come to, only to faint again, I thought she too would die. It was hard to keep from crying then, so every two or three minutes I would run away and hide until I could come back quiet.<br><br>That night seemed to last forever. Again I was home; the same scene was there. Mother's dull cry of misery never ceased or varied, Miriam helpless and without self control could do nothing for herself or her. Father had all to do. I tried to help him; I dont know whether I did though. My thoughts were so busy elsewhere. How did he die? the question haunted me where ever I turned, but I dared not ask; I felt what it was. It must have been very late when I asked Mrs Day, and I felt as though it was stamped in red hot iron on my brain; Mr Sparks had killed him -- she need not have told me. I must have known it centuries before, and through all those ages it had been burning in my very soul.<br><br>Had he ever lived? It must have been a dream, all those pleasant days, where Harry was mingled with all happy thoughts. Was it years ago, or only a week past that very night that he was laughing at me while I dragged mother around in a dance, that he joined his violin to my guitar, and called on Miriam and Lydia to sing with us? That last supper where we were so [p. 4] happy, where I drew from him stories of London and Paris, and complained that he did not tell me enough, and promised myself that one day, when I should be his little house-keeper, he should tell me all -- was that real? O no! it had never been. "Harry" was a name, a fancy of my own brain -- he had never lived.<br><br>And yet in the same breath, I cried "He was so good!" <i>Was!</i> and I did not believe that he had ever existed -- <i>was</i> I said, when the next instant I could not realize that he could possibly be no more! Those were strange thoughts that took possession of me then, and though now it seems to me that I was little short of insane, at the time I fairly hugged myself with the satisfaction of knowing that outwardly at least, I was calm, and that no one would guess what I suffered. I who felt that self control, when there was real anguish, was impossible!<br><br>After a while, one by one every one left; Miriam was to stay all night with Lilly, and I was left alone with father and mother. Mother would cry out "What will you do without him, Sarah? you loved each other so! You will miss him, for he loved you best of all!" Poor mother! she forgot her loss in thinking of mine. I believe it was that consciousness of his love for me that was sustaining me through all that. I thought of his life, where we two had been thrown more together than any of the others, and recalling all the past, could thank God that I had never said or thought a harsh word about him.<br><br>The day he left home, he had taken [p. 5] off a shirt which mother wanted to use as a pattern for the set she was making him. It was lying at the foot of the bed, where she had been sewing on the others until sunset that evening, with nothing to show it had been worn save the crease in the collar and cuffs. But she cried out when she saw it, and said to take it away. Father wanted to take it; he thought I would be afraid. Afraid of dear, dead Harry who had been so good to me all his life! I could not feel so, and I carried it away my self.<br><br>That long night as I lay awake in bed, I held his daguerreotype in my hand, and thought of him lying cold and stiff in the coffin so far away. I could see the gas light shining on his white face, I could see all as though I were present. I thought how fortunate it was that Lydia, Gibbes and I had not gone to Linwood that morning as we intended; how strange it was that when I awoke at five, and heard the rain, I checked my feeling of disappointment with "I'll have to be thankful I cannot go yet" and when I went down to breakfast with a feeling of vague misery that I could not shake off, all laughed at me for my first attack of blues, they said, and declared it was because I did not get off. Father said "This is the first time I ever knew you to give way to a feeling of disappointment; I must say I thought you more reasonable." I felt the reproach, but could only declare that I was not sorry we did not go, I was sure it was for the best, and in return got laughed at again.<br><br>Even Lydia wondered at me, and all the morning over at her house with [p. 6] Miriam, I was weighed down with the load I felt on my heart. In going over to dinner, I felt that I must try to be myself again, and commenced singing Harry's "Partant pour la Syrie" to prove my resolution; but I could not finish. At last, while at table I said to Miriam "I <i>will</i> conquer! What o'clock is it?" "Just three." "Good! from this hour, Richard is himself again!" and from that time, I was as gay as I had before been depressed. Laughing still, I went to Mrs Brunot's, and I shall never forget the horror struck face, as she fell back against the wall, looking at me with out a word. I thought she must have heard bad news of Felix, and entered the parlor without staying to ask. The girls met me so singularly, I felt as though I was an unwelcome guest. They were talking of something strange I knew, but the instant I entered all was still.<br><br>Three or four gentlemen were there, and all eyed me until I was ill at ease. I tried to talk, but every time I mentioned Harry they seemed unwilling to speak of him, until I really felt piqued about it. Presently, we went to walk in the State House grounds, I with Mr Walsh. I could not help speaking of Harry still. He remarked Gibbes looked very handsome with his hair cut short. I said "That's because he looks like Hal. Hal is the handsomest, as well as the best man God ever made. I know people do not think so, but, Bah! nobody can appreciate him as I do!" He looked so curiously at me, that I was half angry with him; but he said nothing. At last I came home, and taking my guitar sang alone [P. 7] in the parlor until first Lydia, then father and mother came in. Then came that scream from mother, who had gone up for her keys with father; and then remembering how sick he looked as he came in, I thought he must be dying, and ran up too. But I dared not see him die, and ran out in the street calling Gibbes. Lydia caught me, and said "Wait! I'll tell you!" but I could only say Father! and dragged her up stairs with me, while she was trying to tell me, but she never did; mother told it.<br><br>O that never ending night! What a relief to see daylight at last, and to be able to get up from the place I had never moved from all night, without thinking of sleep! I dressed in a hurry, and came to this room -- his then -- where all his clothes were lying, as though he would be back in a little while, and folded them and put them away. The brown cap -- the one he said he would save for this winter! -- which he wore until he left, was lying there too. He said he loved it, it had been so serviceable to him; so I took it to keep for him. My task was finished, and the sun was rising on the first of May.<br><br>They said Jimmy had come, and running down, I met him in the entry. It was the first time in a year, for he had just come from Annapolis. It was such a sad time to welcome the dear little fellow home; may I never witness such another scene, as his meeting with mother! It was then, for the first time, that we knew how he [Hal] died, fully. Every body knew it, but ourselves, less than an hour after, but we did not know even of his death, until four hours after it occured. Jimmy said he looked [p. 8] so grand lying so still and pale, there was such a holy light shining on his face, and all pain and sorrow had passed away, and Hal's soul was before God, trusting in His mercy. Gone in his brightest days! Gone when all on earth seemed to promise only pleasure, and merited happiness for the rest of his days! Gone, with his heart full of the beauty and goodness of the whole world -- gone to dust and ashes!<br><br>O Hal! Was I right in saying when you came home, that you would not be with us long, that Death was shining in your eyes? Mother and Miriam would not believe me, and laughed, but I knew you must go. Those eyes looked too holy to stay here; they did not belong to this world. God sent that light there to show me that he would take you from the harm to come; there is no disappointment in the tomb, Hal; and it was written in the book of Fate that you were not to prosper in this world; your aim was too high, and disappointment would have crushed your soul to the earth. Better be laying in your grave, Hal, with all your noble longings unsatisfied, than to have your heart filled with bitterness as it would have been, for your motto, as I always said when you spoke of future success, was that ominous "Never!" Those glorious eyes, with God's truth sparkling in them, are now dimmed forever, Hal. Yet, <i>not</i> forever; I shall see them at the Last Day; bury me where I may see them again. O please God, let me die as calmly as he. And let Hal be the first to welcome me, and lead me before Thee, in the name of Jesus Christ!<br><br>[P. 9] Jan 26th 1862<br><br>Three months ago today, how hard it would have been to believe, if any one had fortold what my situation was to be in three short weeks from then! Even as late as the eighth of November, what would have been my' horror if I had known that in six days more, father would be laid by Harry's side! That evening he looked so well and was so cheerful, and felt better than he had been for two weeks; I little thought of what was coming. How well I remember that same day, at our reading club at Mrs Brunot's, I stopped reading to tell the girls of the desk father had that morning given me, and I went on to talk of his care and love, for my comfort and me, until -- I don't know why, unless it was the premonition of his coming death -- I lost all control, and burst out crying, though I tried to laugh it off. At that hour, one week after, I was standing at the head of his grave, looking down at his coffin with dry eyes.<br><br>When we came home from reading, we found father with a severe attack of Asthma, but he had it so often, that we thought this too would pass off in a little while; but it was not to be; he never again drew a free breath. At night, he grew so much worse, that Dr Woods was sent for at his request, as Dr Enders could not be found? O how hard I prayed God that he might be relieved! It seemed as though my prayer was answered, and for an hour and a half, he seemed to suffer less. At the end of that time, about nine at night, he told me to go to Lilly, and let Charlie stay with him all night. I kissed him good night as he sat in his arm [p. 10] chair under the chandelier in the parlor, and went away confident that I would find him well in the morning.<br><br>I woke at <i>[sic]</i> early the 9th, but dreaded to move for fear that something, which I vaguely felt hovering over me should be true, but Lilly called to me to dress quickly and go home with her, for father had been insensible ever since I had left. At the corner, as we were hurrying here, we met Dr Enders, who laid his hand on Lilly's arm and said "If you go to see your father, you must be prepared for what ever may happen." I waited long enough to hear her ask if he was dying, and his answer "I believe so" and then I was off, and never knew how I reached the parlor.<br><br>Father was lying on matresses <i>[sic]</i> on the left of the mantle as I entered, or rather he was sitting up, propped with pillows, for he was too sick to be carried up stairs. His hands were moving as though he were writing, and his eyes, though staring, had not a ray of light in them. Dr Woods, Miriam and mother were supporting him, and someone told me he had not an hour to live. I went to my room then, and asked God to spare him a little while longer; it was dreadful to have him go without a goodbye, our dear father we all loved so. When I came down, I felt he would not die just yet. He was still the same, and until two, we watched for some change. Then he began to expectorate, and Dr Woods told me if he could throw off the phlegm from his lungs, his reason would return.<br><br>It was a sad way of keeping Brother's birthday, sitting by what was to be father's death bed. But he grew better towards evening, and they said [p. 11] he was perfectly conscious, and almost out of danger. Mother did not believe them; she said if he was conscious he would want to know what he was doing on the floor in the parlor instead of being in his bed. He seemed to know that he had not full possession of his reason for once when I was sitting by him he asked for his spectacles; I brought them and he said "Where is my paper, dear?" I told him he had not been reading, and he gave me back his spectacles saying "Take them, darling; my mind wanders."<br><br>That was Saturday; but Sunday, he was much better,...</p><h2>Clean Cakes: Delicious patisserie made with whole, natural and nourishing ingredients and free from gluten, dairy and refined sugar</h2><p><p><br><b>The ultimate cookbook for anyone who wants to eliminate gluten, dairy or refined sugar from their diet, while still satisfying their sweet tooth and creating their own nutritious, guilt-free masterpieces.</b><br><br> From the author of&nbsp;<i>The Natural Baker,&nbsp;</i><i>Clean Cakes </i>is packed full of over 75 beautifully photographed delicious recipes, including&nbsp;rich chocolate brownies;&nbsp;a show-stopping courgette, basil, lime and pistachio layer cake; raw desserts; five grain omega mix granola bars;&nbsp;spectacular fruit pies and enticing savoury tarts.

J. O&#x2019;Rourke, reads Adam Smith&#x2019;s revolutionary <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> so you don&#x2019;t have to. Recognized almost instantly on its publication in 1776 as the fundamental work of economics, <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> was also recognized as really long:&nbsp; the original edition totaled over nine hundred pages in two volumes including the blockbuster sixty-seven-page digression concerning the variations in the value of silver during the course of the last four centuries,&#x201d; which, to those uninterested in the historiography of currency supply, is like reading Modern Maturity in Urdu.&#x201d; Although daunting, Smith&#x2019;s tome is still essential to understanding such current hot-topics as outsourcing, trade imbalances, and Angelina Jolie. In this hilarious, approachable, and insightful examination of Smith and his groundbreaking work, P. J. puts his trademark wit to good use, and shows us why Smith is still relevant, why what seems obvious now was once revolutionary, and why the pursuit of self-interest is so important.</p><p>"Later economists, such as, in the early nineteenth century, J. B. Say, felt that Smith undervalued the economic contributions of services. And he did. The eighteenth century had servants, not a service economy. It was hard for a man of that era to believe that the semi-inebriated footman and the blowzy scullery maid would evolve into, well, the stoned pizza delivery boy and the girl behind the checkout counter with an earring in her tongue."<br><br>"Unfortunately, Adam Smith didn't have graphs. Hundreds of pages of The Wealth of Nations that readers skim might have been condensed into several pages that readers skip entirely. Another thing Smith didn't have, besides graphs, was jargon. Economics was too new to have developed its thieves' cant. When Adam Smith was being incomprehensible he didn't have the luxury of brief, snappy technical terms as a shorthand for incoherence. He had to go on talking through his hat until the subject was (and the reader would be) exhausted."<br><br>"Some jobs require protection, to ensure they are performed locally in their own communities. My job is to make quips, jests, and waggish comments. Somewhere in Mumbai there is a younger, funnier person who is willing to work for less. My job could be outsourced to him. But he could make any joke he wanted. Who would my wife scold? Who would my in-laws be offended by?

This book makes the full range of his thought available for the first time to scholars and students of world mission, theology, and church history.</p><p>This book brings together lectures and articles by the renowned historian of world Christianity, making them available, many for the first time, to scholars and students of world mission. While examining the many aspects that have characterized mission, indigenous Christianity, and colonialism in modern Africa, The Missionary Movement in Christian History has a far broader reach. Essays such as &#34;The Gospel as the Prisoner and Liberator of Culture&#34; reveal the paradoxes of the Christian movement as a whole in discussing how different primitive Mediterranean Christianity is from early Catholicism, from Celtic monasticism, from Reformation Protestantism, and from Nigerian Spirit Christianity. Andrew Walls shows how the central question for Christianity has always been one of identity in many different forms, a phenomenon revealed at each stage of its history by the missionary movement. What this means for theology, however, has hardly been explored. This is the subtext of Walls&#39; work, providing extraordinary insights and successful counters to secular critiques of world Christianity.</p><h2>The Soul of the Stranger: Reading God and Torah from a Transgender Perspective (HBI Series on Jewish Women)</h2><p>Reading some of the best-known Torah stories through the lens of transgender experience, Joy Ladin explores fundamental questions about how religious texts, traditions, and the understanding of God can be enriched by transgender perspectives, and how the Torah and trans lives can illuminate one another. Drawing on her own experience and lifelong reading practice, Ladin shows how the Torah, a collection of ancient texts that assume human beings are either male or female, speaks both to practical transgender concerns, such as marginalization, and to the challenges of living without a body or social role that renders one intelligible to others&#x2015;challenges that can help us understand a God who defies all human categories. These creative, evocative readings transform our understanding of the Torah&#x2019;s portrayals of God, humanity, and relationships between them.</p><p>JOY LADIN holds the David and Ruth Gottesman Chair in English at Stern College of Yeshiva University.&#x201c;An intellectual and spiritual journey illuminated by the audacity of faith in God.

And her readers will find the work transformational to their own relationships to other humans and to God.&#x201d; (Rabbi Burton L. Visotzky, Jewish Theological Seminary)<br><br>&#x201c;In this beautifully written book, Ladin uses transgender experience to shed light on the Torah and the Torah to shed light on transgender experience.

Flower essences are safe and powerful catalysts that anyone can use. Not only do they bring clarity to the conscious mind and develop many intuitive abilities, but they also resolve negative beliefs and directly affect us at the level where we make decisions about our emotions, health, vitality and relationships. Flower essences unlock our inherent positive qualities such as love, courage and joy. <br><br>Naturopath Ian White has taken this age-old study and applied it to the flowering plants of the Australian bush, showing that the energy and power in the ancient lands of Australia are manifested in the healing properties of its plants. <br><br>In<i> Australian Bush Flower Essences</i>, he gives an informative yet personal picture of fifty bush flower essences from all over the country, as well as detailed information about their preparation and use in all areas of healing.

But contrary to the prevailing attitude, might the Old Testament contain relevant and meaningful application for today? Renowned author and scholar Walter Kaiser shows why the Old Testament deserves equal attention with the New Testament and offers a helpful guide on how preachers and teachers can give it the full attention it deserves. <br><br>Growing out of his teaching material from the last decade, <i>Preaching and Teaching from the Old Testament </i>demonstrates Kaiser's celebrated straightforward exposition. Offering an apologetic for the Christian use of the Old Testament, the opening chapters deal with the value, problem, and task of preaching from it. Following a discussion of the role of expository preaching, Kaiser provides a practical focus by examining preaching and teaching from the texts of various genres. A final chapter explores the relevance of the Old Testament in speaking to a contemporary audience.<br><br>Bible teachers, pastors, seminary students, and professors will appreciate Kaiser's practical focus and relevant applications. Additional helps include a glossary and suggested outlines and worksheets for expository preaching.</p><p>Walter C. Kaiser Jr. (Ph.D., Brandeis University) is president of Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary and Colman Mockler Distinguished Professor of Old Testament.

Justice for food workers and small farmers has joined the rising tide of concern over the impact of industrial agriculture on food animals and the broader environment, all while a global epidemic of obesity-related diseases threatens to overwhelm modern health systems. An emerging worldwide social movement has turned to local and organic foods, and struggles to exploit widespread concern over the next wave of genetic engineering or nanotechnologies applied to food. Paul B. Thompson's book applies the rigor of philosophy to key topics in the first comprehensive study explore interconnections hidden deep within this welter of issues. Bringing to bear more than thirty years of experience working closely with farmers, agricultural researchers and food system activists, he explores the eclipse of food ethics during the rise of nutritional science, and examines the reasons for its sudden re-emergence in the era of diet-based disease. Thompson discusses social injustice in the food systems of developed economies and shows how we have missed the key insights for understanding food ethics in the developing world. His discussions of animal production and the environmental impact of agriculture break new ground where most philosophers would least expect it. By emphasizing the integration of these issues, Thompson not only brings a comprehensive philosophical approach to moral issues in the production, processing, distribution, and consumption of food -- he introduces a fresh way to think about practical ethics that will have implications in other areas of applied philosophy.<br></p><p><br><strong>Paul B. Thompson</strong> has been a leading scholar in food ethics for over thirty years. He was present at the founding of three professional societies for food ethics and has served in an advisory capacity for the U.S. National Research Council, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, Genome Canada, and Wageningen University and Research Institute in the Netherlands , among others. He edited the<em> Encyclopedia of Food and Agricultural Ethics</em> (Springer) and writes a blog for Thornapple Community Supported Agriculture in Lansing MI.<br><br>"Once in a while somebody writes an important book near the end of a long, distinguished career. Paul B. Thompson, after 40 years in the business, accomplished this in his recent book: <em>From Field to Fork, food ethics for everyone</em>. With the eye of a philosopher and the rigor of an agricultural economist - Thompson is both - he covers big ideas about food ... the book's strength is its broad swath. It leaves deeper coverage to the motivated reader and he cites over 350 references to point the way. If you want to hack your way through the thicket of food ethics, <em>From Field to Fork</em> is a good place to start. Splendid work, Dr. Thompson." -- Mark L. Wilson, <em>Agriculture and Human Values</em><p></p><br>"Thompson convincingly shows how food production and food consumption are linked to ethical issues regarding social justice, the environment, and risk. Drawing on three decades of scholarship, he constructs a map of the field that brings together often disconnected discussions concerning (among many other things) poverty, obesity, animal welfare, environmental protection and gene technology. The book clearly lives up to its subtitle, 'Food Ethics for Everyone,' as it is a highly accessible, comprehensive and fair-minded guide to the field." --Peter Sand�e Professor and Head of Section for Consumption, Bioethics and Governance, University of Copenhagen<p></p><br>"<em>From Field to Fork</em> makes it clear that every food choice has ethical implications and that sorting out these implications from the science and politics of food is anything but simple. The ethical issues discussed in this book are fascinatingly complex and deserve the serious debates they are sure to stimulate. If ever a book provided food for thought, it's this one." <br>--Marion Nestle, Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health at New York University, and author of <em>Food Politics</em> <br><p></p><br>"Who eats what, and the journey that food takes - 'field to fork' as Thompson aptly puts it--have becomes major concerns worldwide. The long food way, the web of entanglements connecting my plate to our planet, can overwhelm us--especially when it proves fraught with ethical problems. Who is eating too little, too much, fairly, freely, with what benefits and harms to whom? Here is an excellent moral analysis, a guide from growing in earth to flourishing in the community of life on Earth." -- Holmes Rolston, III, Colorado State University <br><p></p><br>"Thompson is the outsider's insider. Having worked within and beside top programs in agricultural research throughout his career, he is also sympathetic toward the alternatives to current agricultural production and their advocates. <em>From Field to Fork</em> offers an even-handed ethical analysis that emphasizes making better choices rather than deriving rigid rules based in ideology. This book should set the agenda for the emergent food ethic." -- Bryan Norton, Profesor Emeritus, Georgia Instiute of Technology <br><p></p><br>"I would recommend this book as essential to anyone writing in the field of dietary ethics, even if just to check and make sure that there isn't an opposing harm they aren't considering. I believe this book stands out as unique in its field as a result of who wrote it; you can tell this book was written by an expert in the field and he does a good job summarizing the source material and its reception, both in its own field and more widely in philosophy." -- <em>Environmental Values</em> <br><p></p><br>"Throughout <em>From Field to Fork</em>, Thompson analyzes a variety of aspects of our contemporary food system, including its relation to obesity, social injustice, livestock welfare, an individual's dietary choice, localism, environmental impact and genetically modified food. With each subject, he goes through some of the ethically relevant information and gives an account of common ethical arguments made about that subject, but his writing does not side with one approach over another...I would highly recommend this one to anyone already interested in the field of dietary ethics, or a related field, and especially anyone who is considering writing on the topic." -- <em>Environmental Values</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Parmenides (Hackett Classics)</h2><p>"Gill's and Ryan's Parmenides is, simply, superb: the Introduction, more than a hundred pages long, is transparently clear, takes the reader meticulously through the arguments, avoids perverseness, and still manages to make sense of the dialogue as a whole; there is a fine selective bibliography; and those parts of the translation I have looked at in detail suggest that it too is very good indeed." --Christopher Rowe, <i>Phronesis</i></p><p>Translated by Mary Louise Gill and Paul RyanText: English (translation) <br> Original Language: Greek</p><h2>The Deadlier Sex (A Dusky MacMorgan Novel)</h2><p>Dusty MacMorgan and his pal Westy O'Davis are fishing along South Florida's Ten Thousand Island coast when they make a most unusual catch-a naked woman.

My dad has one, my brothers all have one, and my uncle Si has one that is a little bit lopsided so it won&#x2019;t interfere with his shotgun. Not me. I&#x2019;m often called the &#x201c;Beardless Brother.&#x201d;<br> <br>I have not been featured on our television show as much as my brothers have, especially Willie and Jase. My first significant appearance on our family&#x2019;s television show came when I had the honor of officiating my parents&#x2019; vow renewal in the premiere of season four. I have heard that episode brought tears to the eyes of a lot of our fans, especially those aware of the hardships my parents endured during their early years of marriage. My mom definitely suffered, and from the time I was very young, I had an up-close and personal view of her struggles and her courage. I witnessed things no one else saw in those days in the late 1960s and early &#x2019;70s. Maybe that&#x2019;s why leading my parents in that beautiful service by the river meant so much to me. Sure, being on television was fun, but standing before our family and friends and seeing my parents so in love and so committed after almost fifty years together&#x2014;some wonderful years, some horrible&#x2014;brought me true joy and happiness.<br> <br>When I do appear on Duck Dynasty, I usually play the role of mediator, voice of reason, or go-to person when someone has a problem. Not much different from the way I function in our family in real life! At a young age, I found myself needing to shoulder a lot of responsibility, and as the big brother to three younger boys whose father was gone a lot, I became a leader in my family. With the exception of a season of foolishness and wild living, I have been a leader ever since. From time to time, though, I do still like to irritate my brothers for fun. Only an older brother can do that in love, right?<br> <br>Having grown up as the son of the Duck Commander, I definitely know how to make a good duck call, and I enjoy being in a duck blind as much as the other men in my family. Though I am part of our family business now, I spent many years of my professional life in church work and ministry. That, and the fact that I&#x2019;m clean shaven, sets me apart from my dad, my brothers, and Uncle Si in the minds of our audience. Those things have also made me a little mysterious, so in this chapter I want to give people a chance to get to know me, the Beardless Brother.<br> A LUMPY MONKEY<p></p> <br>You may be aware that my mom, known as &#x201c;Miss Kay,&#x201d; got pregnant with me before she and my dad, Phil, were married. My mom turned seventeen on December 21, 1964, while she and Dad were living in Ruston, Louisiana, where he attended Louisiana Tech University. I was born at Lincoln General Hospital in Ruston on January 5, 1965. I guess I could say that, at just a few days old, I made my media debut in a local newspaper photo with Mom because I was the first baby born in Lincoln parish that year. Obviously, if five days of the New Year passed before a baby was born in the parish, the population was not exactly booming.<br> <br>Mom was so young and inexperienced that she thought babies were like puppies&#x2014;she didn&#x2019;t know my eyes were supposed to be open.<br> <br>Unfortunately, I was not what people consider a &#x201c;beautiful baby.&#x201d; I had to fight to make my entrance into the world and was finally delivered by forceps, which made my head lumpy. In addition, the forceps slipped during my birth and hit my left eye. The eye did not open for three weeks! Mom was so young and inexperienced that she thought babies were like puppies&#x2014;she didn&#x2019;t know my eyes were supposed to be open. All of this resulted in my uncle Tommy&#x2019;s giving me the nickname &#x201c;Lumpy Monkey.&#x201d;<br> <br>Our young family spent a lot of time with Uncle Tommy and his wife during my first few years because he and my dad were both in college and Dad was a star quarterback. I will always respect my mom for finishing high school with a newborn and a husband who felt more comfortable in a duck blind or on a football field than changing diapers. My mom has written about this time in our lives in The Women of Duck Commander, and Dad wrote about it in Happy, Happy, Happy, so I will not go into detail. I will just say it was a very rough time for all of us. My dad was the way he was&#x2014;which was very challenging to say the least&#x2014;and my mom stuck it out.<br> JUNCTION CITY<p></p> <br>When I was four years old, Dad graduated college and we moved to Junction City, Arkansas, where he took a job teaching and coaching at a school while working on his master&#x2019;s degree. Mom worked for the superintendent of the school system, and with both of my parents employed by the school district, we were able to live in a house on the school campus. Later that year, Jase was born.<br> <br>In those days, in a small town in Arkansas, there was no such thing as day care or Mother&#x2019;s Day Out. My parents had to work, so they found someone to care for Jase and enrolled me in school. Even though I entered first grade at only four years old, I was somehow able to handle myself socially and academically with six-year-olds.<br> <br>By the time I was in third grade, life was wonderful for me. We still lived on the school property, which meant the whole playground was available to me whenever I wanted to build forts, zip down a slide, or swing on the monkey bars. In addition, the nearby cemetery proved irresistible to me as an adventurous, imaginative, all-boy kind of kid. I do not remember ever being afraid of much. In fact, I was infatuated with fire and even jumped into a pile of smoldering debris in our local dump, burning both my feet. Apparently, I didn&#x2019;t learn my lesson, because on another occasion, I took a running leap into a pile of dry leaves&#x2014;not realizing they were actually covering a lower layer of leaves that had been reduced to embers&#x2014;and burned my feet again, resulting in major blisters for days.<br> <br>We had no money for doctor bills in those days, so whether I had burned feet or one of my many cuts and bruises, Mom or Dad did the best they could with it. I&#x2019;m sure Mom had a habit, like many mothers, of kissing things to make them better, and I remember Dad taking a needle and thread to stitch together some of my most gaping wounds. Things like that might be appalling to people today, but they characterized the way we lived.<br> BAD COMPANY, GOOD NEIGHBORS<p></p> <br>During that time, Dad had some hunting buddies who were not good influences on him. He began to spend more time drinking and carousing with them and less time at home with us. So, of course, my parents&#x2019; marriage became more difficult than it already was, and Dad became abusive. His abuse was mostly verbal, not often physical. I did get spanked on a regular basis, but I have to admit that I deserved most of those spankings.<br> <br>As our family life deteriorated, I began to feel responsible for certain things. In a way, maybe I felt I had to be the man of the house because no one else was filling that role. I definitely cared about my mother and hated the way she was being treated, but she handled these less-than-ideal circumstances with great strength and courage. Mom was very aware of her need to work in those early days and help provide for our family. I think she learned early that she would always have to carry a heavier load than most women, as she tried to be there for her boys and work to make up for Dad&#x2019;s deficiencies. She had an inner strength and knew that she was able to be both parents when Dad wasn&#x2019;t around. She took care of Jase and me, but I also took on a caretaking role for Jase. Even at that young age, I understood intuitively that our family situation was bad, and something in me wanted to look out for my little brother.<br> <br>I had no idea that someone&#x2014;or Someone&#x2014;had been looking out for me too. I now know that God had an amazing couple in place to help me after we moved onto the school property. Back then, I just thought they were nice neighbors. This preacher and his wife, Brother and Sister Layton, were probably in their seventies. They came to meet our family as soon as we moved in and quickly befriended me, almost adopting me as a grandchild. By that time, Sister Layton had been blind for about twelve years, but that did not stop her from making cookies and Kool-Aid for me almost every afternoon and telling me Bible stories while I snacked.<br> <br>The first summer we lived in Junction City, Brother and Sister Layton took me to Vacation Bible School at their church, and I had a great time being with other children, playing, and learning about God. They also took me to church every Sunday and every Wednesday night. I had no idea then what a crucial time that was for me: the Laytons were laying a foundation that would sustain me for the rest of my life, as they helped me learn basic biblical principles, characters, and stories. They made it possible for me to have a meaningful connection with God and church, and I was the only person in my family who had any kind of spiritual relationship at all at that point. I look back now and realize that my mom has always had a tender heart for God, but during those years she was simply doing her best to survive. Since Dad would not go to church, she did not go either.<br> <br>My dad has always had a great personality, and people in Junction City loved him because of it. But they also knew he was a drunk, and his reputation suffered. He held his job at the school for about three years, then quit when he realized he was about to be fired because of the way he was living. I do not know exactly what all was going on at that time, but I do remember asking him if he would take me hunting and he said, &#x201c;No.&#x201d; When I wanted to know why, he told me he might have to take off running from the game warden. He meant it. He was doing some illegal things in his outdoor activities, but I did not understand that at the time. Though I could not have articulated it, I did perceive that all he really wanted to do was hunt, fish, and drink and that having a family was a drain on his lifestyle. It was not a happy time.<br> NO PLACE TO RAISE A FAMILY<p></p> <br>When Dad quit his job at the school, we had to move. He found work managing a bar outside Junction City, and we lived in a trailer next to the bar. This decision made a big statement to his Christian parents and siblings that he was committed to his lifestyle of drinking. By that time, Willie had come along, so all five of us&#x2014;two parents, three-year-old Jase, newborn Willie, and me&#x2014;lived in a one-bedroom trailer with a tiny living area and a kitchen so small we could hardly turn around in it.<br> <br>Dad got into a serious altercation, a real fracas, complete with ambulances and police cars, which resulted in his taking off into the woods running from the law.<br> <br>Once we moved from the school property, the Laytons no longer came to pick me up for church. Thankfully, another lady from their church lived close to us and developed an interest in me. She started taking me to church, so I never lost my connection there, and I will always be grateful for that.<br> <br>Within a year, we were able to expand our home to a fourteen-by-seventy-foot trailer, which made our living conditions more comfortable. Dad made good money at the bar, but the environment was not positive for our family. Mom never did like having us boys exposed to the things we saw around the bar&#x2014;some very bad things&#x2014;but she went along with it because the job provided a measure of financial security, and she did not know what else Dad could do because of his drinking.<br> <br>After running the bar for a couple of years, Dad got into a fight with the owners. It was a serious altercation, a real fracas, complete with ambulances and police cars, which resulted in his taking off into the woods running from the law. That left my mom alone with three young boys. She ended up having to move quickly, taking us and basically just our clothes with her. Because the bar owners insisted she leave the state immediately, she had to leave her washing machine, dryer, and many of her mementos and special things in a storage shed. Mom and Dad had saved some money by that time, but she used it to pay off the bar owners and get us out of Arkansas. Our lives were about to get a lot worse.</p><h2>A Place at Our Table (An Amish Homestead Novel)</h2><p><p><em>Kayla Dienner has suffered her fair share of heartache, which is why she vows to protect her heart at all costs . . . until she meets Jamie Riehl.</em></p><p>Along with his volunteer work at the local fire department, running his Amish farm keeps Jamie Riehl busy.

While its cooking traditions have been influenced by those of China, France, and even India, Vietnam has created a cuisine with a spirit and a flavor all its own.</p><p>Chef and restaurateur Mai Pham brings to life this diverse and exciting cooking in <em>Pleasures of the Vietnamese Table.</em> Born and raised in Saigon before emigrating to the United States, Mai has often returned to her native land to learn the secrets of authentic Vietnamese cooking, from family, friends, home cooks, street vendors, and master chefs. Traveling from region to region, she has gathered the simple, classic recipes that define Vietnamese food today: Green Mango Salad with Grilled Beef, Stir-Fried Chicken with Lemongrass and Chilies, Caramelized Garlic Shrimp, and especially <em>pho,</em> the country's beloved beef-and-noodle soup. With more than 100 recipes in all, <em>Pleasures of the Vietnamese Table</em> offers home cooks the chance to create and savor the traditional flavors of Vietnam in their own kitchen.</p><p>Filled with enchanting stories and stirring black-and-white photos of life in Vietnam, <em>Pleasures of the Vietnamese</em> Table provides a captivating taste of an enduring culture and its irresistible cuisine.</p></p><p>When Mai Pham--chef and owner of the renowned Lemon Grass Restaurant in Sacramento, California--left her home and her grandmother in Saigon in 1975, just days before the city fell to communist rule, she never thought she'd see either again. Happily for her, she returned 20 years later to rediscover her roots and reconnect with her 100-year-old grandmother. Happily for us, she's written <i>Pleasures of the Vietnamese Table</i>, in which she shares that journey--and the vibrant cuisine of her homeland. She weaves a stirring tale of rediscovery; of visiting with cooks in market stalls and street caf�s and home kitchens; and, perhaps most importantly, of rediscovering her "favorite food on earth," <i>pho</i>, the noodle soup often referred to as the national dish of Vietnam.<p> Pham begins with a chapter on dipping sauces, condiments, and herbs, which, she explains, are the true backbone of Vietnamese cooking. She explores culinary variations: the "rice bowl" of the southern peninsula and the French- and Indian-inspired foods of Saigon; the more robust style of the cooler central region of Hue; and the straightforward style of the mountainous north. And she shares the simple, classic recipes that define Vietnamese food. Green Mango Salad with Grilled Beef is at once salty (from the ubiquitous fish sauce), sweet from the fruit, and tangy and spicy from Chili-Lime Sauce. Ginger Chicken is bright with the flavor of ginger and spicy with dried chilies; caramel sauce adds body and an intriguing sweet and smoky element to the dish. And of course, one can't forget the beloved <i>pho</i>, which gets a whole chapter to itself. The traditional Hanoi-style Vietnamese "Pho" Rice Noodle Soup with Beef is fragrant with anise and ginger and thick with velvety noodles and delectably rare beef suspended in the hot broth.</p><p> Featured throughout the book are black-and-white photographs of the country and its people, stories of Pham's childhood, and enchanting tales of the history and people of Vietnam that, taken together, highlight a rich and vibrant picture of the ancient cuisine of this complex country. Helpful guides to the Vietnamese pantry and cooking techniques, along with a glossary, menu suggestions, and a list of resources for the more exotic ingredients make the book extremely useful to even the uninitiated. <i>--Robin Donovan</i></p><p>Mai Pham was born in Vietnam and raised in both Vietnam and Thailand. Now chef and owner of the acclaimed Lemon Grass Restaurant in Sacramento, California, Mai is a food columnist for the <em>San Francisco Chronicle,</em> a frequent contributor to the Los Angeles Times, and a regular guest chef instructor at the Culinary Institute of America.

True, they have no literature, no fine arts, and don't understand the concept of recreation, but neither do they understand the concepts of greed, envy, lust, or any of the sins and vices that plague humankind. Their world seems darned near perfect. And that is just what disturbs the good Father.<p> First published in 1959, James Blish's Hugo Award-winning <i>A Case of Conscience</i> is science fiction at its very best: a fast-paced, intelligent story that offers plenty of action while at the same time explores complex questions of values and ethics. In this case, Blish has taken on the age-old battle of good vs. evil. Lithia poses a theological question that lies at the heart of this book: is God necessary for a moral society? The Lithians are nothing if not moral. Not only do they lack the seven deadly sins, they also lack original sin. And without any sort of religious framework, they have created the Christian ideal world, one that humans would be eager to study and emulate. But is it too perfect? Is it in fact, as Father Ruiz-Sanchez suspects, the work of The Adversary? And what role does Egtverchi, the young Lithian raised on Earth, play? Is he an innocent victim of circumstance, or will he bring about the Dies Irae, the day of the wrath of God, upon the earth? The fate of two worlds hinges on the answers to these questions, and will lead to an ancient earth heresy that shakes the Jesuit priest's beliefs to their very core.</p><p> <i>A Case of Conscience</i> is a brilliant piece of storytelling, and it packs a lot into a scant 242 pages. Most readers will probably finish the book in one sitting, unable to stop until the spectacular denouement.

The beginning is marked by a vivid memory, which I can reconstruct down to the last detail. Before, there is nothing, and after, everything is an extension of the same vivid memory, continuous and unbroken, including the intervals of sleep, up to the point where I took the veil ."</em> So starts Cesar Aira's astounding "autobiographical" novel. Intense and perfect, this invented narrative of childhood experience bristles with dramatic humor at each stage of growing up: a first ice cream, school, reading, games, friendship. The novel begins in Aira's hometown, Coronel Pringles. As self-awareness grows, the story rushes forward in a torrent of anecdotes which transform a world of uneventful happiness into something else: the anecdote becomes adventure, and adventure, fable, and then legend. Between memory and oblivion, reality and fiction, Cesar Aira's <em>How I Became a Nun</em> retains childhood's main treasures: the reality of fable and the delirium of invention.<br><br> A few days after his fiftieth birthday, Aira noticed the thin rim of the moon, visible despite the rising sun. When his wife explained the phenomenon to him he was shocked that for fifty years he had known nothing about "something so obvious, so visible." This epiphany led him to write <em>How I Became a Nun</em>. With a subtle and melancholic sense of humor he reflects on his failures, on the meaning of life and the importance of literature.</p><p><p>Nominated for a Neustadt award and the Man Booker International Prize, <strong>C�sar Aira</strong> was born in Coronel Pringles, Argentina, in 1949. He has published at least one hundred books and was most recently the creator of a limited edition, &#x201c;Valise,&#x201d; for the Museum of Modern Art, NYC.&nbsp;</p><p>The poet <strong>Chris Andrews</strong>&nbsp;teaches at the University of Western Sydney, Australia, where he is a member of the Writing and Society Research Centre. He has translated books by Roberto Bolano and C�sar Aira for New Directions. He has won the Anthony Hecht Poetry Prize for his poetry and the Valle-Inclan Prize for his translations.</p>A six-year-old child sickened by eating cyanide-contaminated ice cream makes for agonies and picaresque adventures from Argentine author Aira (<i>Adventures in the Life of a Landscape Painter</i>), who draws on a wave of real food-supply poisonings in Latin America during the 1950s for this slim autobiographical novel. Newly moved from a Buenos Aires suburb to a rough-and-tumble neighborhood in the southern city of Rosario, the young C�sar is taken for a first ice cream by his father. Despite its rancid taste, the father forces C�sar to eat it, and then, in an escalating standoff, beats the vendor to death. Subsequent chapters in this elliptical, disjointed work trace C�sar's hallucinatory stint in the hospital (where a rich fantasy life takes hold for good) while the father languishes in prison, and C�sar's painful, delayed transition into first grade. Eventually, C�sar makes friends with a rich boy, Arturito, and a game of dressup goes spectacularly awry, but the die is cast: C�sar, who often cannot distinguish between dream and reality, will be a writer. Completed in 1989, Aira's near-memoir is a foreboding fable of life and art. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But what of Empire in an age of &#x201c;American empire&#x201d;? Has fear become our permanent condition and democracy an impossible dream? Such pessimism is profoundly mistaken, the authors argue. Empire, by interconnecting more areas of life, is actually creating the possibility for a new kind of democracy, allowing different groups to form a multitude, with the power to forge a democratic alternative to the present world order.Exhilarating in its optimism and depth of insight, <b>Multitude</b> consolidates Hardt and Negri&#x2019;s stature as two of the most important political philosophers at work in the world today.</p><p>Complex, ambitious, disquieting, and ultimately hopeful, <i>Multitude</i> is the work of a couple of writers and thinkers who dare to address the great issues of our time from a truly alternative perspective. The sequel to 2001's equally bold and demanding <i>Empire</i> continues in the vein of the earlier tome. Where <i>Empire</i>'s central premise was that the time of nation-state power grabs was passing as a new global order made up of "a new form of sovereignty" consisting of corporations, global-wide institutions, and other command centers is in ascendancy, <i>Multitude</i> focuses on the masses within the empire, except that, where academics Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri are concerned, this body is defined by its diversity rather than its commonalities. The challenge for the multitude in this new era is "for the social multiplicity to manage to communicate and act in common while remaining internally different." One may already be rereading that last sentence. Indeed, <i>Empire</i> isn't breezy reading. But for those aren't afraid of wadding into a knotty philosophical and political discourse of uncommon breadth, <i>Multitude</i> offers many rewards. <i>--Steven Stolder<i></i></i>Michael Hardt is a professor in the literature program at Duke University.<br><p>Antonio Negri is an independent researcher and writer and a political prisoner recently released from house arrest in Rome, Italy.

On a visit to the beach he intuitively solves an ancient riddle, finds a pirate&#x2019;s treasure, and becomes a very wealthy man. Even so, C�sar&#x2019;s bid for world domination comes first and so he attends a literary conference to be near the man whose clone he hopes will lead an army to victory: the world-renowned Mexican author, Carlos Fuentes. A comic science fiction fantasy of the first order, <em>The Literary Conference</em> is the perfect vehicle for C�sar Aira&#x2019;s take over of literature in the 21st century.</p><p><p>Nominated for a Neustadt award and the Man Booker International Prize, <strong>C�sar Aira</strong> was born in Coronel Pringles, Argentina, in 1949.

Her translations include works by Ce�sar Aira, Horacio Castellanos Moya, Jose� Emilio Pacheco, Elena Poniatowska, Jorge Franco, and Marti�n Ada�n, among others.</p>As any proper mad scientist should, the narrator of prolific (70 books and counting) Argentinian writer Aira's antic novella wants to conquer the world, to effect which he has mastered portable cloning. Because money would help, he solves the mystery of the Macuto Line in Mexico and, claiming the treasure at the line's end in the gulf, proceeds to a literary conference in Venezuela, of which he and Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes are guests. His scheme is to clone a great genius&#x2014;Fuentes, that would be&#x2014;and thereby realize his fiendish ambitions, somehow. Of course, things go awry, and huge blue worms descend on the conference's host city. This not-unlikely-for-the-movies scenario is interestingly wrinkled by the fact that the mad scientist and Aira himself are one and the same (that's why the former is feted as the latter by the conference). Because fiction writers are often conflated with their protagonists, and actors with their roles, and writers and actors both may envy their characters' adventures, the story comes by its self-reflexiveness honestly. Hilariously, too. --Ray Olson</p><h2>The Living Thoughts of Kierkegaard (New York Review Books (Paperback))</h2><p>Translated from the Danish by Walter Lowrie, David Swenson, and Alexander Dru<br><br>The Danish philosopher Kierkegaard is one of the master thinkers of the modern age, a defining influence on existentialism and on twentieth-century theology, and this brilliantly tailored selection from his vast and varied writings--made by the great English poet W.H Auden--is a perfect introduction to his work. Auden's inspired and incisive response to a thinker who had done much to shape his own beliefs is a fundamental reading of an author whose spirit remains as radical as ever more than 150 years after he wrote.</p><p>Soren Kierkegaard (1813-1855) was born and lived in Copenhagen.

He rolled his feet to the floor, sitting slumped on the side of the bed with his head in his hands, and listened to the calls to prayer sounding in ones and twos from the minarets as the sun rose across the Miljacka valley. Eyes glazed with fatigue, an ache in his head and an acid churn in his belly, he watched without seeing the crawl of light across his room, his mind still floundering to escape the clutches of his dream. He jerked as he smelled smoke, an acrid sting of memory, and blinked it back. Only a memory, but another sign of the inside leaking out more and more into his waking world. He wondered if he was going mad.</p><p>With trembling hands he lit a cigarette. His head swiveled to the side as he drew deeply, then tilted back as he exhaled through puffed cheeks, his eyes closed, the hangover beginning to bite. The smoke swelled up above him, rising, dissipating. Reinhardt watched it for a moment then let his head sag over his fingers, curled like a cage around the cigarette. Gingerly, he ran a fingertip across his temple, feeling the dull bruise beneath the skin where, more and more, the weight of his pistol was the last thing he felt at night.</p><p>Someone knocked at the door, and he froze, startled out of the fog of his thoughts. The knocking came again, and his name, muffled through the door. He put a hand on the bedside table and pushed himself quietly to his feet, but his arm felt numb and heavy from where he had slept on it, and it slipped, slid, and bumped the pistol, which clattered and clinked against the bottles and glasses.</p><p>Reinhardt stared guiltily across the room in the sudden silence. The knocking came again, louder. He put out his cigarette, gritting the stub into a whisper of ash; put a hand out to the wall to steady himself as his left knee gave its usual twitch; and began to shuffle down the side of the bed. He rested both hands on either side of the door frame, breathed deeply, and rolled his head on his neck, feeling the ache skitter around inside his skull like a steel ball in a bowl, and ran a finger across the bruise at his temple. Another deep breath, and he threw the latch back on the door and flung it open.</p><p>A soldier stood in the hallway outside, a fist raised to hammer the door again. Steely eyes regarded him from under the rim of a field cap, a sergeant&#x2019;s insignia on his broad shoulders. For a moment there was silence, and Reinhardt realized he must make quite a sight, his hair tangled, shirt twisted out of his trousers, and his feet in socks.</p><p>&#x201c;Captain Reinhardt?&#x201d;</p><p>Reinhardt looked at him through the spreading ache behind his eyes, half recognizing him. &#x201c;I think you bloody well know who I am.&#x201d;</p><p>The man put his heels together and saluted. &#x201c;Sergeant Claussen, sir. I have orders for you to report to Major Freilinger immediately.&#x201d; The man was built like a boulder, short and squat with his uniform stretched taut over his chest and belly.</p><p>Reinhardt stared at the sergeant. &#x201c;To Major Freilinger?&#x201d; he croaked. He coughed, swallowed, and tried again. &#x201c;Freilinger? What does he want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There has been a murder, sir,&#x201d; said Claussen.</p><p>&#x201c;Murder?&#x201d; Reinhardt put his hand behind his neck and rubbed it, turning his head from side to side. He thought he saw Claussen&#x2019;s eyes stray to the mark he was sure was on his temple, and he straightened up. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that got to do with us? This city still has a police force, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Major Freilinger instructed me to tell you that one of the victims is a fellow military intelligence Abwehr officer. Lieutenant Hendel.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stefan Hendel? Freilinger said he was Abwehr?&#x201d; Claussen nodded. &#x201c;Very well. Give me ten minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir. Ten minutes.&#x201d; Claussen was an experienced NCO. The four green stripes of a master sergeant on his arm were proof of that, and a good NCO knew how to frame a statement to an officer so it sounded like an order. Reinhardt flushed again at the picture he must make, picked up his towel and toiletry bag, and stalked out of his room down the corridor to the bathroom.</p><p>He bent over one of the sinks as he felt the churning in his stomach come heaving up. He retched, his head beginning to pound as he doubled over but, as so often, nothing came up, only a sickly rasp of bile, like the viscous residue of his life and work. His stomach calmed, eventually, and he shivered as he stayed bent over the sink, the hammering in his head turning into a dull ache that squatted in the top of his skull.</p><p>He rested his head in his hands, eyes pressed into the heels of his palms. Another night and he had hardly slept, and what sleep he managed gave him no rest. Another night spent in the cells under the prison, facing prisoners of war across bare rooms under caustic lights. Another night spent piecing together the puzzles these men represented, pulling together information and intelligence from a dozen other interrogations from the nights and days before them, here and elsewhere. Norwegians, Frenchmen, Englishmen, Australians, Arabs... now Yugoslavs. Partisans. They had all come and gone in front of him since this war started.</p><p>The pipes shuddered and coughed a spray of water into the cracked porcelain of the basin. He swallowed a couple of aspirin, drank as much as he could, then carefully shaved, looking through his reflection. He rinsed off and only then allowed himself to look in the mirror. Not quite as bad as he felt, he saw. Dark blue eyes like pits, cheeks gaunt above the tight line of his mouth, the close-cut cap of his brown hair graying at his temples. An average face. One that would go unnoticed in a group of three men, as his old police instructor used to joke.</p><p>He wet his tousled hair, combed it, splashed cologne on his face and water in his armpits, and he was done. He looked in the mirror a last time, wiping away the steam to stare at himself.</p><p>&#x201c;As good as it gets,&#x201d; he muttered, pulling out the light and walking back to his room. Reinhardt shut the door in Claussen&#x2019;s face, let his trousers puddle around his feet, then peeled off his shirt and let his underpants and socks join the heap on the floor. Outside, the call of the muezzins faded away across the valley that held the town of Sarajevo cradled in its slopes. As if needing to fill the silence, the bells of St. Anthony&#x2019;s, up behind the barracks, began to toll.</p><p>Outside came the squeal of the trams at Vijecnica as they went around the corner at the city hall. He twisted his shoulders into his suspenders, sat to pull on his boots, pausing a moment to stare at the picture of his dead wife in its silver frame on the bedside table, tracing a fall of hair with a fingernail along the glass.</p><p>Reinhardt placed the picture gently into a drawer and wound his watch. It was just a cheap Phenix, but winding it always made him think of the watch he had left behind in Berlin with Meissner, for safekeeping. A pocket watch, heavy, old fashioned, a British- made Williamson hunter with an inscription on its silver casing, and the memory of his finding it as vivid as ever.</p><p>He shrugged into his jacket, medals and metal clinking dully, closing each button with a firm movement as he stared at the window, thinking of nothing except the day to come and how to get through it. A step at a time, he knew. One after the other. Head down, back bent, eyes no more than two steps ahead, step after step until the day was done. He cinched a wide leather belt around his waist and took his cap from a hook on the wall and his pistol from the tabletop, sliding the gun into the holster with a dull rasp of metal on leather. Looking in the small mirror behind the door he adjusted the fit of his cap, then stuffed a pack of Atikahs and some matches into the pocket of his jacket and opened the front door.</p><p>&#x201c;All right, let&#x2019;s go,&#x201d; he said, as he locked his door. Claussen straightened, his eyes flicking to the Iron Cross pinned to the left breast of Reinhardt&#x2019;s tunic and back to Reinhardt&#x2019;s face. He saw the change come across Claussen&#x2019;s eyes as a decorated captain in the Abwehr came out of the room a half-drunk, half-dressed man had gone into.</p><p>Claussen led the way downstairs and into the cobbled length of the central courtyard of the Bistrik barracks, built by the Austrians at the start of their occupation of Bosnia at the end of the nineteenth century. They walked to a slope-nosed <i>k�belwagen</i> where a soldier was smoking a cigarette. He stubbed it out and saluted Reinhardt, his eyes looking up and over the captain&#x2019;s left shoulder. &#x201c;Corporal Hueber reporting, Captain,&#x201d; he snapped. He was tall and raw-boned, cheeks flecked with acne.</p><p>&#x201c;Hueber is our Serbo-Croat specialist,&#x201d; said Claussen as he opened the <i>k�belwagen</i>&#x2019;s door for Reinhardt. &#x201c;Major Freilinger said to bring a translator, just in case our Croat friends decide to forget their German.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At ease, Corporal,&#x201d; said Reinhardt. &#x201c;You speak the language?&#x201d; Reinhardt had picked up something of the language in his two tours in Yugoslavia. More than enough to follow the gist of conversations, order drinks, and scan the headlines of what passed for newspapers. He shook a cigarette from his pack and put it in his mouth.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir. My mother&#x2019;s family were from Zagreb.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Carry on, then,&#x201d; he said, settling into the car. The other two climbed in, and Claussen engaged first with a grind and steered them past the sentries in their striped pillboxes and into the street. Reinhardt wedged his shoulders against the rim of the door and put his arm along the central bar behind the front seats, his hand resting on the empty weapons racks. Remembering the cigarette in his mouth, he lit it, drew deeply, exhaled, then after a moment&#x2019;s consideration offered cigarettes to Claussen and Hueber.</p><p>Claussen drove over the Latin Bridge to Kvaternik Street, the old Austrian Appelquai, then followed the trams down to Vijecnica. They traveled past the jumbled Oriental warren of Bentba a with its uneven cobbled streets and Ottoman houses with white walls and red roofs, and back through the city, past Ba car ija with its caf�s dotted around its cobbled sweep. The air was cool this early in the morning, underlaid with the smell of coal and wood smoke, but the clear skies promised another scorcher of a day. Up at the top of Vratnik hill, beyond the jumble of roofs and minarets, the white walls of the old Ottoman fortress stared blankly down on the city.</p><p>&#x201c;What more did Freilinger tell you?&#x201d; asked Reinhardt as Claussen sped up again down King Aleksander Street. The city&#x2019;s latest masters, the Independent State of Croatia&#x2014;the NDH&#x2014;had renamed it Ante Pavelic Street after their version of the F�hrer, but everyone, even those in charge, still called it Aleksander. At a crossroads, Usta e policemen&#x2014; Croatian fascists in black uniforms with rifles strapped across their backs&#x2014;were pulling down Communist Party posters that must have been put up overnight. The walls on both sides of the road were covered in scraps of white paper where dozens more had been pulled down. More Usta e stood guard over a group of men kneeling on the pavement with their hands on their heads. Two bodies lay in the street.</p><p>Claussen squinted around the cigarette smoke spiraling up into his eyes and slowed to bump the car over a bad patch of road. &#x201c;The major only said the murders had occurred at an address in Ilida.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ilida?&#x201d; said Reinhardt. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a bugger of a drive. And I need something to eat.&#x201d; He scanned the road ahead and motioned for Claussen to pull over while he jumped out and bought <i>kifla</i> off a trader in baggy black trousers and a red waistcoat pushing a handcart. The man kept his head down, his eyes sliding over him and past, as if around an absence, but Reinhardt was used to that now.</p><p>The bread was warm, soft, and salty-sweet as he chewed and watched the city go by. Down past the gutted ruin of the Sephardic synagogue, past the yellow arches of the city market, past the Imperial fa�ades of Marijin Dvor and the old State House where the general staff had its offices, past the tobacco factory, the white exterior of the National Museum, and the long stretch of wall that hid the Kosevo Polje barracks, and then they were leaving the main part of Sarajevo behind and driving almost due west, the Miljacka valley opening out to north and south.</p><p>There was space here you never seemed to find in the city&#x2019;s hunched streets. Orchards and fields running away from the road in long rectangles, the rolling countryside speckled with the four-sided roofs of traditional houses. The old Austrian road was dotted with horse carts, donkey carts, sheep and goats, tradesmen, farmers, women in twos and threes wearing long veils who turned away as the car went past. At the other end was the spa resort of Ilida, nestled at the foot of the forested swell of Mount Igman, a sort of smaller, cleaner, more spacious counterweight to the city that lay behind them all squeezed in and jumbled up the slopes of the mountains that pinched off the eastern end of the valley.</p><p>The drive was a fairly long one, and despite the best efforts of the engineers, the road was not standing up well to the constant pounding of the military traffic along it. Claussen was forever slowing, braking, and swerving around ruts and potholes, but the drive gave Reinhardt time to think, time to recover from his binge, and time to start feeling ashamed of himself. He found his fingers again brushing over the spot on his head to which he had put the pistol, his mind opening again to the emptiness he struggled each night to encompass. With an effort, he tamped down on it, pushed it away, but it was becoming harder not to let the depression and despair he felt at night overwhelm him during the day. Again, he caught Claussen looking at him out of the corner of his eye, and he clenched his right fist tight and held it on his leg.</p><p>He tried to think instead about the victim, Hendel. In Sarajevo for three months or so. Prior to that with the Abwehr in Belgrade. He did internal army security and before that was in technical work&#x2014;radios, cameras and such. Spoke the language fairly well, Reinhardt recalled. Liked the ladies and got out on the town whenever he was off duty. That was pretty much all he knew about him. He could not talk to either of the men with him in the car about anything Hendel might have been working on, so he put his head back and closed his eyes.</p><p>He must have dozed off to the vibration of the car because Claussen woke him up as they arrived in Ilida. Reinhardt&#x2019;s mouth felt thick, but the few minutes&#x2019; sleep he had snatched seemed to have refreshed him. Claussen turned left at the crossroads in front of the Hotel Igman, another of the Austrians&#x2019; neo-Moorish constructions, and continued south. Past the twin Austria and Hungary hotels, staring at each other across the round sweep of their lawn where an old gardener in a white fez watched them go by. Several staff cars were parked on the drive in front of the Austria, big, shiny vehicles with pennants at the front and motorcycle escorts. Just after the hotels, Claus...</p></p><h2>Psychology of the Future: Lessons from Modern Consciousness Research (Suny Series in Transpersonal and Humanistic Psychology)</h2><p><i>Summarizes Grof's experiences and observations from more than forty years of research into non-ordinary states of consciousness.</i><br><br>Summarizes Grof's experiences and observations from more than forty years of research into non-ordinary states of consciousness.<br><br>This accessible and comprehensive overview of the work of Stanislav Grof, one of the founders of transpersonal psychology, was specifically written to acquaint newcomers with his work.

If more psychiatrists could be persuaded that human consciousness transcends the limitations of the physical brain, and instead is but an aspect of what may best be described as 'cosmic consciousness,' we could not only expect treatment modalities to change, but we could also anticipate the possibility of culture-wide rethinking of the basic presuppositions of modern cosmology, the cosmology that grounds Western institutions, ideologies, and beliefs about the nature of personhood." -- Michael E.

Having no sons, he teaches his daughters the intricacies of Mishnah and Gemara in an era when educating women in Jewish scholarship was unheard of. His middle daughter, Miriam, is determined to bring new life safely into the Troyes Jewish community and becomes a midwife. As devoted as she is to her chosen path, she cannot foresee the ways in which she will be tested and how heavily she will need to rely on her faith. With <i>Rashi's Daughters</i>, author Maggie Anton brings the Talmud and eleventh-century France to vivid life and poignantly captures the struggles and triumphs of strong Jewish women.</p><p>"Rashi's Daughters" is the story of the three daughters of the great Talmudic authority Salomon ben Isaac, a.k.a. Rashi, who lived in 11th century Troyes, France and had no sons. At a time when most women were illiterate and the rare educated woman was one who could read the Bible, Rashi's daughters studied Talmud. They were also vintners, merchants and mothers of the next generation of Talmudic scholars.<p> </p><p>Built on seven years of exhaustive historical research and ten years of Talmud study, "Rashi's Daughters" explores what might have been, weaving actual events, as described in responsa literature and Talmud commentaries, into an account of the lives of these amazing women. Talmud is an integral part of these novels; readers will learn along with Rashi's daughters as he explains selected texts. This is also the story of the medieval French Jewish community, how they lived, loved, worked, ate, prayed and interacted with their non-Jewish neighbors. A wealth of material about Jewish women's daily lives is provided, including how they observed life cycle events and holidays.</p><p> </p><p>I wrote this book because I wanted to share my research into Jewish women's lives in medieval France, how the prosperity and tolerance they enjoyed differed from the negative stereotypes usually associated with the Middle Ages. In addition, I wished to encourage women to study Talmud, the foundation of Jewish Law that, until very recently, women have been unable to access. I hoped to share the excitement and pleasure Talmud study can engender.</p>Rashi's Daughters: Miriam - Prologue <p> </p><p>Times had never been better for the Jews of northern France than in the second half of the eleventh century. Relations with their Christian neighbors were tolerant, even amiable on occasion, since the Church was too busy rooting out heretical sects and implementing Pope Gregory's controversial reforms to concern itself with the Jews. European society was entering 150 years of advances in political organization, economics, scientific pursuit and education, in what is now called the 12th Century Renaissance. </p><p> Under the feudal system, the Jews' social status was high, equal to that of knights. The Jewish trader was a welcome visitor to French estates, bringing news of the outside world, buying their surfeit produce and selling them imported goods. Jews were moneylenders much as department stores and gasoline companies are today; if their customers received the bulk of their income at harvest time, for example, merchants extended them credit until then.</p><p> As Christian Europe's resources grew, Jews bought wheat, wool, wine and steel, and then transported it to the Muslim east, where they sold it for a profit. In return they acquired silk, cotton, spices and jewels, which they brought back to the west, sold for another profit, and began the cycle again. Everyone prospered. </p><p> The Jews of Troyes benefited greatly from this commercial success. Under the enlightened sovereignty of Count Thibault, the great fairs of Champagne attracted merchants from throughout the known world, many of them learned in Jewish Law. Credit was extended from one fair to the next, in this infancy of the modern banking system. Since local middlemen collected a percentage of every sale, the Jews of Troyes became so affluent that even the poorest families had servants. </p><p> In 1068, one of these families was that of twenty-eight year old Rabbi Salomon ben Isaac, who would be known and revered centuries later as Rashi, one of Judaism's greatest scholars. After fifteen years studying in Germany's finest Talmudic academies, he was forced to return home to manage the family vineyard, fallen into decline due to his mother's senility. With no sons, and desperate from having to give up his yeshiva studies, Salomon broke with tradition and secretly began teaching Talmud to his daughters, Joheved and Miriam. </p><p> But Salomon did not lack male students for long. Isaac haParnas, the leader of the Jewish community, saw an opportunity to attract more Jewish merchants to the fairs in Troyes by establishing a Talmud academy there. He offered Salomon a generous salary to teach his grandsons, and other boys soon joined them, forming the nucleus of a new yeshiva. To ensure that Salomon had sufficient time to teach, Isaac haParnas partnered with him in the wine business, which finally lifted the vintner's family out of poverty. </p><p> Salomon also had time to begin writing his twin commentaries on the Bible and the Talmud. His Bible commentary is so authoritative that today it is studied is every rabbinic school. Yet his extraordinarily clear and concise commentary on the Talmud is his true magnum opus. Since the Talmud was first printed in the 15th century, his words fill the inside column of every page of every copy. Today more Jews read Rashi's words each day than those of any other Jewish scholar. </p><p> Not surprisingly, Salomon's daughters found fianc�s from among his students. First Joheved was betrothed to Meir ben Samuel, a lord's son from nearby Ramerupt. Miriam, however, enjoyed a love match with Benjamin ben Reuben, son of a vintner in Rheims. Her initial compassion for the homesick youth blossomed into a deeper feeling as they worked together in Salomon's vineyard. Joheved, terrified that Meir would discover that she knew Talmud, tried to hide her learning from him. But Miriam suffered no such fears with Benjamin, and the two of them would often study Salomon's lessons together. </p><p> Over the next several years, Salomon's yeshiva thrived as more and more foreign merchants studied with him during the twice-yearly fairs, and then sent their sons to him during the year. His family grew as well when his wife Rivka gave birth to another daughter, Rachel. Miriam was so helpful during the delivery that the midwife, her Aunt Sarah, began training her as an apprentice. </p><p> Miriam learned to grow her own midwife herbs and to find the others she needed in the local forest; she helped deliver Countess Adelaide's baby during a complicated childbirth, thereby saving both the countess and the child; she prepared and administered an abortion potion for Catharina, an unmarried childhood friend; and she successfully delivered Joheved's first child.</p><p> All this time, Miriam and Joheved continued to study Talmud with their father. When their grandmother died, they took over her position leading services for the women in synagogue, and though they didn't seek it, they were on the way to assume leadership in the community of Jewish women. But Miriam gave no thought to the future of Troyes' Jews or her possible role in it. At seventeen years old, she was focused on her own future as she and Benjamin eagerly prepared for their wedding.</p></p><h2>The History of the Future: Oculus, Facebook, and the Revolution That Swept Virtual Reality</h2><p><p><strong>A <em>USA Today </em>bestseller</strong></p><p><strong>The dramatic, larger-than-life true story behind the founding of Oculus, its quest for virtual reality, and its founder's contentious battle for political freedom against Facebook,&nbsp;from the bestselling author of <em>Console Wars.</em></strong></p><p>In <em>The History of the </em><em>Future</em>, Harris once again deep-dives into a tech drama for the ages to expertly tell the larger-than-life true story of Oculus, the virtual reality company founded in 2012 that&#x2014;less than two years later&#x2014;would catch the attention of Mark Zuckerberg and wind up being bought by Facebook for over $2 <em>billion</em> dollars.</p><p>This incredible underdog story begins with inventor Palmer Luckey, then just a nineteen-year-old dreamer, living alone in a camper trailer in Long Beach, California.

But he has one last piece of unfinished business. The last pass he hopes to throw is to close the circle with his great partner on those Celtic teams, fellow Hall of Famer Bill Russell, now 84. These teammates were basketball's Ruth and Gehrig, and Cooz, as everyone calls him, was famously ahead of his time as an NBA player in terms of race and civil rights. But as the decades passed, Cousy blamed himself for not having done enough, for not having understood the depth of prejudice Russell faced as an African-American star in a city with a fraught history regarding race. Cousy wishes he had defended Russell publicly, and that he had told him privately that he had his back. At this late hour, he confided to acclaimed historian Gary Pomerantz over the course of many interviews, he would like to make amends.<br><br>At the heart of the story THE LAST PASS tells is the relationship between these two iconic athletes. The book is also in a way Bob Cousy's last testament on his complex and fascinating life. As a sports story alone it has few parallels: An poor kid whose immigrant French parents suffered a dysfunctional marriage, the young Cousy escaped to the New York City playgrounds, where he became an urban legend known as the Houdini of the Hardwood. The legend exploded nationally in 1950, his first year as a Celtic: he would be an all-star all 13 of his NBA seasons. But even as Cousy's on-court imagination and daring brought new attention to the pro game, the Celtics struggled until Coach Red Auerbach landed Russell in 1956. Cooz and Russ fit beautifully together on the court, and the Celtics dynasty was born. To Boston's white sportswriters it was Cousy's team, not Russell's, and as the civil rights movement took flight, and Russell became more publicly involved in it, there were some ugly repercussions in the community, more hurtful to Russell than Cousy feels he understood at the time.<br><br>THE LAST PASS situates the Celtics dynasty against the full dramatic canvas of American life in the 50s and 60s. It is an enthralling portrait of the heart of this legendary team that throws open a window onto the wider world at a time of wrenching social change. Ultimately it is a book about the legacy of a life: what matters to us in the end, long after the arena lights have been turned off and we are alone with our memories.</p></p><p>Gary M. Pomerantz, historian, journalist and Stanford University lecturer, is the author of six nonfiction books on topics ranging from history to sports to civil rights. His first, <i>Where Peachtree Meets Sweet Auburn</i>, on Atlanta's racial conscience, was named a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year. He also authored <i>WILT, 1962</i>, about Wilt Chamberlain's legendary 100-point game (a <i>New York Times</i> Editors' List selection), <i>Nine Minutes, Twenty Seconds</i>, about an aviation crash, and <i>The Devil's Tickets </i>about a Jazz Age murder and trial. His most recent book, <i>Their Life's Work</i>, a narrative about the 1970s Pittsburgh Steelers, explores football's gifts and costs. For the past twelve years, he has taught reporting and writing at Stanford's Graduate Program in Journalism.<b>One of the <i>Boston Globe&#x2019;s</i> Best Books of The Year</b><br><br>&#x201c;The first Gary Pomerantz book I read was his biography of Wilt Chamberlain, which I thought was magnificent.

Ultimately, the story of Reconstruction is about how a middle class formed in America and how its members defined what the nation would stand for, both at home and abroad, for the next century and beyond.<br><br> A sweeping history of the United States from the era of Abraham Lincoln to the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, this engaging book stretches the boundaries of our understanding of Reconstruction. Historian Heather Cox Richardson ties the North and West into the post&#x2013;Civil War story that usually focuses narrowly on the South, encompassing the significant people and events of this profoundly important era.<br><br> By weaving together the experiences of real individuals&#x2014;from a plantation mistress, a Native American warrior, and a labor organizer to Andrew Carnegie, Julia Ward Howe, Booker T. Washington, and Sitting Bull&#x2014;who lived during the decades following the Civil War and who left records in their own words, Richardson tells a story about the creation of modern America.</p><p>Q:&nbsp; How is this book different in its focus and scope&nbsp;from other books on Reconstruction?<br>&nbsp;<br>A:<i>&nbsp; West from Appomattox</i> expands the usual story of Reconstruction both geographically and temporally. Tying the North, South, and West together into a story that reaches beyond 1877 reveals a more complex pattern than is found in the usual accounts of Southern racism or Northern industrialism. &nbsp;This is a story of the creation of the American middle class around an ideology that celebrated individualism even as it harnessed the government to its own interests.<br><br>Q:&nbsp; Why should people read this history?<br>&nbsp;<br>A:&nbsp; First of all, I hope it&#x2019;s fun. It explains Jesse James, Mother&#x2019;s Day, Monopoly, Sitting Bull, and a whole bunch of things that are part of our everyday culture. But it also makes a larger argument about the creation of an American mindset that has determined our history since 1900, and that still influences our politics today.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q:&nbsp; How does it relate to today's political and social environment?<br>&nbsp;<br>A:&nbsp; Political discourse today echoes the fights of Reconstruction. During the Civil War era, the Republicans created national taxes and dramatically expanded voting. Ever since, the questions of tax dollars and how they are spent have been the focus of political debate. Are voters hard-working&#x201d; citizens who want policies that will be good for everyone, or are they special interests&#x201d; looking for a government handout?<br><br>Q:&nbsp; Why "West from Appomattox"?<br>&nbsp;<br>A:&nbsp; Americans looked west for new opportunities after the Civil War, and western symbols came to represent an American ideal of hard-working citizens in a land of small government. At the same time, though, those symbols obscured the fact that the newly created middle class was expanding the government to bolster its own interests even as its members extolled individualism. Even today, the same tensions over the role of government persist. And the symbol of America is still the cowboy.<b>Heather Cox Richardson</b> is professor of history at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and the author of <i>The Death of Reconstruction: Race, Labor, and Politics in the Post&#x2013;Civil War North</i>.

He leaned at the air as if waiting for it to finish him off, only it wouldn&#x2019;t, not today, for this, fairly suddenly, didn&#x2019;t feel like a time for murderers to be getting favors.<br>&nbsp;<br>No, today he could sense it.<br>&nbsp;<br>He could smell it.<br>&nbsp;<br>He was immortal.<br>&nbsp;<br>Which pretty much summed things up.<br>&nbsp;<br>Trust the Murderer to be unkillable at the one moment he was better off dead.<br>&nbsp;<br>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *<br>&nbsp;<br>For the longest time, then, ten minutes at least, he stood at the mouth of Archer Street, relieved to have finally made it, terrified to be there. The street didn&#x2019;t seem much to care; its breeze was close but casual, its smoky scent was touchable. Cars were stubbed out rather than parked, and the power lines drooped from the weight of mute, hot and bothered pigeons. Around it, a city climbed and called:<br>&nbsp;<br>Welcome back, Murderer.<br>&nbsp;<br>The voice so warm, beside him.<br>&nbsp;<br>You&#x2019;re in a bit of strife here, I&#x2019;d say.&nbsp;. . . In fact, a bit of strife doesn&#x2019;t even come close&#x2014;-you&#x2019;re in desperate trouble.<br>&nbsp;<br>And he knew it.<br>&nbsp;<br>And soon the heat came nearer.<br>&nbsp;<br>Archer Street began rising to the task now, almost rubbing its hands together, and the Murderer fairly caught alight. He could feel it escalating, somewhere inside his jacket, and with it came the questions:<br>&nbsp;<br>Could he walk on and finish the beginning?<br>&nbsp;<br>Could he really see it through?<br>&nbsp;<br>For a last moment he took the luxury&#x2014;-the thrill of stillness&#x2014;-then swallowed, massaged his crown of thorny hair, and with grim decision, made his way up to number eighteen.<br>&nbsp;<br>A man in a burning suit.<br>&nbsp;<br>Of course, he was walking that day at five brothers.<br>&nbsp;<br>Us Dunbar boys.<br>&nbsp;<br>From oldest to youngest:<br>&nbsp;<br>Me, Rory, Henry, Clayton, Thomas.<br>&nbsp;<br>We would never be the same.<br>&nbsp;<br>To be fair, though, neither would he&#x2014;-and to give you at least a small taste of what the Murderer was entering into, I should tell you what we were like:<br>&nbsp;<br>Many considered us tearaways.<br>&nbsp;<br>Barbarians.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mostly they were right:<br>&nbsp;<br>Our mother was dead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Our father had fled.<br>&nbsp;<br>We swore like bastards, fought like contenders, and punished each other at pool, at table tennis (always on third-- or fourth--hand tables, and often set up on the lumpy grass of the backyard), at Monopoly, darts, football, cards, at everything we could get our hands on.<br>&nbsp;<br>We had a piano no one played.<br>&nbsp;<br>Our TV was serving a life sentence.<br>&nbsp;<br>The couch was in for twenty.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sometimes when our phone rang, one of us would walk out, jog along the porch and go next door; it was just old Mrs.&nbsp;Chilman&#x2014;-she&#x2019;d bought a new bottle of tomato sauce and couldn&#x2019;t get the wretched thing open. Then, whoever it was would come back in and let the front door slam, and life went on again.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yes, for the five of us, life always went on:<br>&nbsp;<br>It was something we beat into and out of each other, especially when things went completely right, or completely wrong. That was when we&#x2019;d get out onto Archer Street in evening--afternoon. We&#x2019;d walk at the city. The towers, the streets. The worried--looking trees. We&#x2019;d take in the loudmouthed conversations hurled from pubs, houses, and unit blocks, so certain this was our place. We half expected to collect it all up and carry it home, tucked under our arms. It didn&#x2019;t matter that we&#x2019;d wake up the next day to find it gone again, on the loose, all buildings and bright light.<br>&nbsp;<br>Oh&#x2014;-and one more thing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Possibly most important.<br>&nbsp;<br>In amongst a small roster of dysfunctional pets, we were the only people we knew of, in the end, to be in possession of a mule.<br>&nbsp;<br>And what a mule he was.<br>&nbsp;<br>The animal in question was named Achilles, and there was a backstory longer than a country mile as to how he ended up in our suburban backyard in one of the racing quarters of the city. On one hand it involved the abandoned stables and practice track behind our house, an outdated council bylaw, and a sad old fat man with bad spelling. On the other it was our dead mother, our fled father, and the youngest, Tommy Dunbar.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the time, not everyone in the house was even consulted; the mule&#x2019;s arrival was controversial. After at least one heated argument, with Rory&#x2014;-<br>&nbsp;<br>(&#x201c;Oi, Tommy, what&#x2019;s goin&#x2019; on &#x2019;ere?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What--a--y&#x2019; mean&nbsp;<i>what,</i>&nbsp;are you shitting me?

Most notably, the mule had ambitions; with the rear fly screen dead and gone, he was known to walk into the house when the back door was ajar, let alone left fully open. It happened at least once a week, and at least once a week I blew a gasket. It sounded something like this:<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Je--sus&nbsp;<i>Christ</i>!&#x201d; As a blasphemer I was pretty rampant in those days, well known for splitting the Jesus and emphasizing the Christ. &#x201c;If I&#x2019;ve told you bastards once, I&#x2019;ve told you a&nbsp;<i>hun</i>dred Goddamn times!&nbsp;<i>Shut</i>&nbsp;the back door!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so on.<br>&nbsp;<br>Which brings us once more to the Murderer, and how could he have possibly known?</p><h2>How to Play Popular Piano in 10 Easy Lessons: The Fastest, Easiest Way to Learn to Play from Sheet Music or by Ear</h2><p>&#x201c;Anyone who can dial a telephone can learn to play popular piano quickly and easily.&#x201d;<br><br>So says Norman Monath, author of <i>How to Play Popular Piano in 10 Easy Lessons.</i> His no-frills, no-drills method will have you playing simple tunes within thirty minutes&#x2014;even if you don't know one note from another.<br> <br>The secret?

During his tenure as music editor at Simon and Schuster, he edited the songbooks of Gershwin, Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein, Burt Bacharach/Hal David, Cole Porter and many others.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>The Piano Keyboard</b><br><br>It would be helpful for you to know something about the construction of the piano keyboard, so I am going to assume you are seated in front of a piano and don't know one note from another. This is what you are looking at:<br><br><b>BLACK KEYS AND WHITE KEYS</b><br><br>The keyboard is a combination of black keys and white keys, the black ones forming a pattern of twos and threes, or twins and triplets, we might say. This pattern makes it easy for us to spot the various notes. For example, the white key immediately to the left of the twins is C and, following the sequence of the alphabet, the white one immediately to the left of the triplets is F.<br><br>The standard keyboard has eight C's. The one in the middle (fourth one up from the left) is called "middle C." You need only know the first seven letters of the alphabet to name the white keys, as you can see from the example above.<br><br>Although the piano keyboard looks quite large, it really consists of a series of duplications. The same notes keep repeating themselves as you go from one end of the piano to the other. The five different black keys and seven different white ones constitute all the twelve tones that have been used for centuries in the music of Western civilization as the basis for all the melodies and harmonies of all the symphonies and songs that you hear. Twelve different tones -- that's all -- and you can play anything by Bach, Beethoven or the Beatles.<br><br>Incidentally, none of this technical information about the construction of the piano keyboard is anything you will have to memorize or keep in mind while you are playing. It is only for your background information, but well worth a few paragraphs because it will put a lot of other important information in perspective for you. For example, if you were a foreigner inquiring about how to get from New York to Florida, my telling you about the difference in climate between the two states would not help you get there; but it would be useful to know that you shouldn't bother bringing a fur-lined overcoat with you. Similarly, knowing something about the mechanics of music will help you make subconscious judgments about the options you may have at any given time.<br><br>If you are near a piano as you read this, you might try playing the twelve notes beginning with middle C, going from left to right or vice versa. You will notice that there is no difference between the sounds made by the white keys compared to the black keys. By this I mean that if you were to close your eyes and a friend were to play various notes, you would not be able to tell which were the result of black or white keys being struck (unless you had absolute pitch, meaning that you would know exactly which notes were being sounded). Therefore, you might well ask why we need black keys as well as white.<br><br>There are basically two reasons. If the piano consisted of all white keys, it would be half-again as wide. That's because the black keys are fitted between the white ones in such a way as not to take up any additional space. Imagine trying to fit a standard eighty-eight-key piano into your living room if it consisted only of the standard-size white keys! And even if your living room could accommodate so wide a piano, imagine yourself trying to play it from one end to the other without a sliding stool!<br><br>The second reason for space-saving black keys is that it makes it possible for the average-size hand to stretch an <i>octave;</i> that is, from one C to the next one above, or one D to the next above. The interval of an octave is very important, since it enables you to <i>double</i> a particular tone. After learning to play melodies using one finger at a time with your right hand, you may find it much richer-sounding in some instances to play the melody in octaves. Also, within the comfortable span of the octave (which you usually play with your thumb and pinky) any of the eleven other tones are playable in between. This allows you to add one or more other tones that may be in keeping with the particular harmony of the tune. In discussing this now, I admit that I'm jumping ahead a bit. Therefore, if you don't quite understand the implications of adding harmonies within octaves, please don't be discouraged. All will become clear to you before you reach the end of this book.<br><br>At this point all you need to know are the designations of the white keys -- C, D, E, etc. An exercise you might try is to strike white keys at random and see how quickly you can name them. You will be surprised at how soon recognition of the notes will become second nature to you.<br><br>Now we are ready to name the black keys. These actually take their names from their neighboring white ones. For example, let's look at the "twins."<br><br>The first black key with the arrow pointing to it is between C and D. Therefore, it will take its name from the C or D on either side. Since it is higher in pitch than the white C (sharper, you might say), it can be called "C sharp." The symbol for a sharp is #, and so instead of spelling out the word, we simply write C#. On the other hand, that same black key in the example above is lower in pitch than its neighboring D (flatter, you might say) and so it may be called "D flat," which is written as Db.<br><br>The second arrow in the illustration above points to a further example of how a black note derives its designation from its surrounding neighbors. In this case we are looking at the black key between D and E, which therefore may be called D# or Eb. The reason why we might choose one designation instead of the other is explained in Lesson Five.<br><br>For the time being, learn to call black keys by either name, so that if I were to ask you to play C# or Db or Eb, you would have no hesitation in finding the key. Similarly, the black key between the white F and white G may be called F# or Gb. The black keys, therefore, are:<br><br>The principle behind the above designations is this: To sharp <i>any</i> note simply play the note immediately to its right; to flat <i>any</i> note, play the note immediately to its left. Therefore, if you were asked to play E#, what would you play? Answer: the white F. What would Cb be? Answer: the white B. In popular music for the piano, however, you will probably never encounter a Cb or a B#. Instead you will see a B for Cb or a C for B# because it's much more direct. However, you should understand the principle involved in creating sharps and flats.<br><br>While on the subject of sharps and flats, you should know there is such a thing as a <i>double</i> sharp and a <i>double</i> flat. The symbol for the first is #, not ##, although bb is the symbol for the latter. An F double sharp (F#) is simply the note G. The rationale is that you are taking F# (a single sharp) and sharping it once again by moving up another half-step. Similarly, E double flat (Ebb) is the note D. Now that you know this, file and forget it. The double sharp and double flat are almost never used in popular music, but at least you won't be shocked if you do see either of these symbols.<br><br>Once again I suggest that you try a simple exercise at the piano. Hit the black keys at random and see if you can name them quickly. At first, try thinking of them as sharps; then refer to them by their flat names. If it takes time for you to figure out the designations, don't be discouraged. When you start to play melodies, you will find that you have ample time to figure out the name of one note before playing another. Most melodies are very slow. For example, hum the first four notes of Gershwin's "I Got Rhythm," which is a fast song, relatively speaking. With your fingers, tap the four beats of those notes and you'll observe how surprisingly slow they seem to be in relation to how fast they sound when played by a band. That's because a band might include a drummer whose rat-tat-tat creates an illusion of speed that the melody alone doesn't actually have. Further, if the band included violins playing tremolos, and clarinets playing high the melody would appear to be going a hundred miles an Now, here's the beautiful part: When you sit down at the and play the melody at <i>two</i> miles an hour, it will not be that way by you or anyone listening to you. Your ears will hear all the fast orchestrations that have become associated with that song and it will sound like you are playing the notes much more quickly. (I resisted saying that you are playing at the speed of sound!)<br><br>The reason I've pointed out that tempo or speed is an illusion is that so much more of music performance is illusory. Too many people have been frightened away from trying to play because of the illusion rather than the reality. Piano playing can look and sound so much harder than it really is, just as a magic trick can appear to be impossible until you learn the surprisingly simple explanation.<br><br><b>INTERVALS</b><br><br>You now know the names of all the keys on the piano. But here is one more thing you should know about the intervals, or distances, between the keys: All adjacent.keys are considered to be one half-step (or semitone or half-tone) apart. In other words, the interval between C and C# is a half-step, just as the interval between E and F is a half-step. The fact that C and C# are a white and a black key while E and F are both white has no relevance in measuring intervals: Adjacent keys of any color are a half-step apart.<br><br>Similarly, the interval between C and D is a <i>whole</i> step (or whole tone), as is the interval between E and F#. From D to F is an interval of a tone and a half; the keys D and F# are <i>two</i> tones apart as are the keys C and E, and so on.<br><br>The concept of intervals is something you should know about but not something you will have to keep in the forefront of your consciousness. By understanding intervals, you will understand the logic of how the various chords are formed. But in order to play chords, you won't need to count intervals -- you'll play them by sight.<br><br>Just as quickly as you can find middle C you will be able to strike a C chord, for example. That will become clear to you within a very few pages.<br><br>In closing this lesson, I would like to point out an interesting fact. If for some reason you were to stop reading this book right now and didn't see a piano for the next ten years, I would be willing to bet anything that you would be able to name every note on the keyboard. All that you have learned up to now would be fresh in your mind.<br><br>So you see, learning to play the piano is not difficult. It is made up of many simple bits of information, once learned never forgotten.<br><br>Copyright � 1984 by Norman Monath</p><h2>Black Wings of Cthulhu: Tales of Lovecraftian Horror</h2><p>From the depths of R'lyeh come twenty-one brand-new, utterly&nbsp;terrifying, and thoroughly entertaining short stories of horror and the macabre!&nbsp;<br><br>Taking their inspiration from works by Lovecraft himself, prominent writers such as Caitlin R.

Robert Fisk's explosive Pity the Nation recounts Sharon and Arafat's first deadly encounter in Lebanon in the early 1980s and explains why the Israel&#x2013;Palestine relationship seems so intractable. A remarkable combination of war reporting and analysis by an author who has witnessed the carnage of Beirut for twenty-five years, Fisk, the first journalist to whom bin Laden announced his jihad against the U.S., is one of the world's most fearless and honored foreign correspondents. He spares no one in this saga of the civil war and subsequent Israeli invasion: the PLO, whose thuggish behavior alienated most Lebanese; the various Lebanese factions, whose appalling brutality spared no one; the Syrians, who supported first the Christians and then the Muslims in their attempt to control Lebanon; and the Israelis, who tried to install their own puppets and, with their 1982 invasion, committed massive war crimes of their own. It includes a moving finale that recounts the travails of Fisk's friend Terry Anderson who was kidnapped by Hezbollah and spent 2,454 days in captivity. Fully updated to include the Israeli withdrawl from south Lebanon and Ariel Sharon's electoral victory over Ehud Barak, this edition has sixty pages of new material and a new preface. "Robert Fisk's enormous book about Lebanon's desperate travails is one of the most distinguished in recent times."&#x2014;Edward Said</p><p>Robert Fisk is Middle East Correspondent of the Independent, based in Beirut.The labyrinthian tale of Lebanon's destruction has been told a number of times from a number of vantage points, but not since Ze'ev Schiff and Ehud Ya'ari's Israel's Lebanon War ( LJ 10/15/84) has such a powerful book appeared. Fisk, a highly honored British journalist who wrote for The Times (London) for 11 years and who still lives in Lebanon, conveys those appalling events of 1976-85 with the passionate intensity of someone outraged at the actions that have turned a country and people inside out. Fisk graphically portrays the Lebanese tragedy through interviews, anecdotal information, and thoughtful, incisive analyses. Thomas Friedman's From Beirut to Jerusalem ( LJ 7/89) and Charles Glass's Tribes with Flags ( LJ 4/1/90) are comparable efforts, but Friedman's work deals more with the psychological aspects of Arab versus Israeli; Glass has a more leisurely pace that belies Fisk's sense of urgency.

He had read deeply in his country&#x2019;s poetry, its plays, and its novels; he was a patriot who had begun to grasp the unique role that Poland&#x2019;s culture had played in its singular history; he was a committed Catholic in a city that had given the Church several saints. In moving to Krak�w with his widower father, he was, in a sense, moving home.<br><br>Still, neither he, his father, those who would be his teachers, nor the men and women who would become his friends imagined that this twenty-�minute walk past the site of the martyrdom of St. Stanis&#x142;aw and the great hill of Wawel, with its royal castle and cathedral, was in fact the first moment in a lifelong pilgrimage during which Karol Wojty&#x142;a, as Pope John Paul II, would bring a Cracovian sensibility to the world&#x2014;�and in doing so would bend the curve of history in a more humane direction while leaving an indelible impression on the life and thought of the Catholic Church.<br><br>To follow Karol Wojty&#x142;a through Krak�w is to follow an itinerary of sanctity while learning the story of a city. Thus, in what follows, the story of Karol Wojty&#x142;a, St. John Paul II, and the story of Krak�w are interwoven in a chronological pilgrimage through the life of a saint that reveals, at the same time, the richly textured life of a city where a boy grew into a man, a priest, a bishop&#x2014;�and an apostle to the world.<br><br>Crossroad<br><br>Krak�w&#x2019;s Rynek G&#x142;owny, the Main Market Square at the heart of the Old City, is the greatest public space in Europe, rivaled only by the Piazza San Marco in Venice for size, architectural achievement, and decorative splendor. To walk through this magnificent example of urban development is to traverse one of the principal crossroads of Europe, in the very heart of Europe. For Poles have never thought of themselves as a part of &#x201c;eastern Europe&#x201d;; Poland is in central Europe, and the center of Poland, its history and culture, is Krak�w.<br><br>From the late fourteenth century to the early seventeenth, during more than two hundred years of growth initiated by the marriage of the young Polish queen Jadwiga to the Lithuanian grand duke W&#x142;adys&#x142;aw Jagie&#x142;&#x142;o, the Polish-�Lithuanian Commonwealth, with its capital in Krak�w, was one of the great powers of Europe. Second only to France in size, it eventually governed a vast expanse of territory reaching from the Baltic in the north to the Black Sea in the south, and from the German Lander immediately to the west to the hinterlands of Moscow in the east. Leaving Krak�w&#x2019;s Royal Castle as the Ottoman Turks closed in on Vienna in 1683, King Jan III Sobieski and the famed Polish heavy cavalry, the Winged Hussars, decisively defeated the last great armed Islamic invasion of Europe. Something of Sobieski&#x2019;s temper, and Poland&#x2019;s, and Krak�w&#x2019;s, can be gleaned from the message&#x2014;�a striking variant on Julius Caesar&#x2019;s&#x2014;�sent by the victorious Polish monarch to Pope Innocent XI (along with the green banner of Muhammad, captured from the Ottoman grand vizier): Veni, vidi, Deus vincit (I came, I saw, God conquered).<br><br>Krak�w was far more than the chief city of a great political-�military power, however. For the old Polish royal capital was, and is, located on the border between Europe&#x2019;s two wings, the Latin west and the Byzantine east. That location is reflected in the city&#x2019;s striking combination of architectural styles, in which the visitor frequently finds elaborate baroque decoration inside churches crowned with onion domes reminiscent of classic Orthodox church architecture.<br><br>Here, in addition to the Latin that was the common tongue of educated people, the local citizens spoke a Slavic language written in the Latin alphabet: another sign that Krak�w and Poland were a bridge across traditional cultural divides. Here, during the European wars of religion, a tradition of civility, tolerance, and respect for the rights of conscience was the accepted public norm. There were no religious persecutions in Reformation-�era Krak�w, no coerced conversions, no burning of heretics. In 1583, Poland&#x2019;s political leaders made a declaration of tolerance, the likes of which could be found nowhere else in Europe: &#x201c;We who differ in matters of religion will keep the peace among ourselves, and neither shed blood on account of differences of Faith, or kinds of church, nor punish one another by confiscation of goods, deprivation of honor, imprisonment, or exile.&#x201d; Poles and Cracovians were not angels, and intolerance certainly warped individual lives. But the public norm was tolerance; it was embodied in the famous declaration of King Zygmunt II August to the Polish parliament, the Sejm, that &#x201c;I am not the king of your consciences&#x201d;; and, as historian Norman Davies once put it, Poland was &#x201c;a land without bonfires,&#x201d; while much of the rest of Europe self-�destructed in the Thirty Years War.<br><br>At the height of the Polish-�Lithuanian Commonwealth, Krak�w was also a major commercial and intellectual metropolis. In the Rynek G&#x142;owny, one could hear a multitude of tongues spoken, buy and sell products from across Europe, plan commercial expeditions to far lands and distant shores. Krak�w&#x2019;s economic vitality and the generosity of wealthy Poles helped support one of Europe&#x2019;s greatest centers of scholarship in the middle of the second millennium&#x2014;�a tradition of learning dating back to the Middle Ages, when intellectually adventurous students from this part of the world traveled the long road to Paris to study under Thomas Aquinas. The Jagiellonian University, which was once sustained by the philanthropy of Queen Jadwiga, grew out of the Krak�w Academy of Theology, and gave Krak�w, Poland, the Catholic Church, and the world both saints and men of genius: Jan Kanty, a late medieval biblical scholar canonized in 1767; Miko&#x142;aj Kopernik (Copernicus), who changed the world&#x2019;s view of the world&#x2019;s place in the universe; and Pawe&#x142; W&#x142;odkovic, who at the Council of Constance in 1414 inveighed against the Teutonic Knights and their practice of conversion by conquest.<br><br>Located above the Vistula River on a rocky promontory at the southern edge of today&#x2019;s Old City, standing watch over Krak�w, is Wawel Hill, the &#x201c;Polish Zion.&#x201d; Wawel&#x2019;s Royal Castle and Cathedral, a complex of structures woven together over centuries, draws one&#x2019;s gaze upward, evoking the great aspirations that made, and make, Krak�w unique. The city ceased to be Poland&#x2019;s political capital in 1596, when King Zyg�munt III moved the seat of government to Warsaw. Yet for almost half a millennium, Krak�w, no longer a center of political power, has remained the cultural and spiritual capital of Poland. Today, the Polish Zion looks over a thriving city at the very center of Europe.<br><br>A City Under Pressure<br><br>When Poland, the state, was erased from the map of Europe by the Third Polish Partition of 1795&#x2014;�a vivisection conducted by the neighboring great powers of Russia, Prussia, and Austria&#x2014;�Krak�w remained one of the great centers of Polish national consciousness. And for a century and a quarter, the years Poles refer to as their national &#x201c;time on the cross,&#x201d; Krak�w&#x2019;s literary, intellectual, and religious life all helped keep alive the idea of &#x201c;Poland&#x201d; while the partitioning great powers sought to eliminate that very notion. Tales of past Polish glories were recited or sung, dreams of Polish independence were dreamt, and rebellions were planned in the city&#x2019;s cafes and noble houses. Memories of Poland&#x2019;s greatness were kept alive in the royal crypts of Wawel Cathedral, where generations of Poles under foreign rule could ponder the achievements of Jadwiga and W&#x142;adys&#x142;aw Jagie&#x142;&#x142;o, Kazimierz the Great and Jan Sobieski. An aesthetic movement, Young Poland, led by men of accomplishment in many artistic fields such as playwright, poet, and painter Stanis&#x142;aw Wyspia&#x144;ski, was centered in Krak�w and breathed new life into Polish literature and visual arts. And while the writers, composers, and artists of Young Poland were crafting their distinctive responses to the failure of the Polish rebellion of 1863 to reestablish national independence, so did two men whom the Catholic Church would later recognize as saints: rebels who, having risked their futures in 1863, staked the balance of their lives on a revolution of the spirit in intense forms of consecrated religious life&#x2014;�Rafa&#x142; Kalinowski and Albert Chmielowski.<br><br>These heroic efforts to keep Poland, the nation, alive during the 123 years that Poland, the state, could not be found on a map seemed vindicated in 1918, when, like a phoenix, the Second Polish Republic arose from the ashes of a Europe that had come to the brink of self-�destruction in the Great War, World War I. Politically, the collapse of the Romanov, Hapsburg, and Hohenzollern dynasties in St. Petersburg, Vienna, and Berlin created the conditions for the possibility of Poland recovering its independence. And yes, Poland&#x2019;s new independence was secured in 1920 by the &#x201c;Miracle on the Vistula,&#x201d; when the forces of Marshal J�zef Pi&#x142;sudski defeated Trotsky&#x2019;s Red Army outside Warsaw and drove it back into Russia. But there would have been no new Polish state to save had Polish culture succumbed to the country&#x2019;s tripartite division and its political extinction. And if the beating heart of Polish culture was to be found in Krak�w between 1795 and 1918, then Poland&#x2019;s rebirth in the aftermath of the Great War was made possible, in no small measure, by Krak�w.<br><br>For a brief period, between the end of World War I and the rise of Hitler and his Nazis, it seemed that Krak�w might return to a calmer life as one of the centers of European culture and learning. But it was not to be.<br><br>Unlike most other Polish cities during World War II, Krak�w was spared obliteration by the German blitzkrieg and the Nazi penchant for gratuitous destruction. The Wehrmacht got to Krak�w too quickly in September 1939 for the city to become a battleground; as the &#x201c;capital&#x201d; of the Nazi slave-�state, the General Gouvernement, from September 1939 until January 1945, the city&#x2019;s fabric was largely spared; and as the Red Army approached in January 1945, the Germans left too quickly to do too much revenge bombing of historic sites and buildings. But Krak�w suffered. And its suffering was beyond the imagining of most westerners.<br><br>Schindler&#x2019;s List gave western audiences some sense of what life in occupied Krak�w, its ghetto, and KL-�P&#x142;asz�w, the local concentration camp, was like. The city of saints and scholars, poets, painters, and dramatists, patriots and tolerant kings was now run by gangsters like Hans Frank, the governor-�general of the General Gouvernement, and Amon G�th, the psychopathic commandant at KL-�P&#x142;asz�w, located across the Vistula from Krak�w&#x2019;s historic Jewish district, Kazimierz. These two men, both of whom were executed for war crimes in 1946, embodied Nazi racial contempt for the Poles as Slavic Untermenschen, lower life-�forms who were to be fed a minimal diet and, over time, worked into extinction, all for the greater glory of the Third Reich.<br><br>Frank presided over a vast territory of lawlessness aptly dubbed &#x201c;Gestapoland&#x201d; by Norman Davies: in the General Gouvernement, there was no rule of law in the ordinary sense of the term, and as a survivor of those draconian five years once put it, &#x201c;It was not a question of knowing whether you would be alive next Christmas or on your next birthday; it was a question of not knowing whether you would be alive tomorrow morning.&#x201d; G�th, whose theft of Jewish property aroused the ire of the German SS (not for the robbery, but because all such stolen goods belonged to the Third Reich), tortured and murdered prisoners for his amusement.<br><br>Even the graphic images of life in occupied Krak�w conveyed by Steven Spielberg&#x2019;s film do not convey the full horror of the occupation, which reflected the Nazi contempt for the spiritual and cultural traditions that had made Krak�w such a unique place. For, according to the demonic ideology of the Third Reich, the Poles were not just to be ground into the dust physically. Their culture and its religious roots were to be spat upon, trampled down, exterminated. Thus on a fateful, and ultimately fatal, November morning in 1939, more than a hundred professors of the Jagiellonian University were summoned to what was announced as a faculty meeting with German officers in the Aula of the university&#x2019;s Collegium Novum. The professors were arrested en masse and transported to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where many of them died despite widespread international protests at their deportation. The university was shut down, as part of the Nazi effort to decapitate Polish culture; and although the Jagiellonian quickly reconstituted itself as an underground institution, higher learning in Krak�w was, formally speaking, over: Untermenschen had no need of higher education.<br><br>The occupation sought to destroy Krak�w&#x2019;s centuries-�old and rich Jewish culture, as well as Krak�w&#x2019;s Jews, as quickly as possible. The Nazis also had no concern for the long-�term survival of the Catholic Church; it was to be tolerated, in a manner of speaking, so long it confined its activities to worship inside its many churches; ultimately, Catholicism would collapse as the Polish people were eliminated. For the short term, however, the vibrant Catholic educational and cultural life that had long characterized Krak�w was put under the Nazi ban. Catholic charitable and educational work was forbidden; the Catholic press was shut down; organizing Catholic youth groups was a capital offense. Thus in one example of persecution, the Germans routed out the Salesian priests at the Church of St. Stanis&#x142;aw Kostka in the working-�class neighborhood of D&#x119;bniki in May 1941, sending all but one to the Dachau concentration camp, where the Salesians lived in the &#x201c;priests&#x2019; barracks&#x201d; (sometimes described as the world&#x2019;s largest monastery) until they died from exhaustion and illness or were executed.<br><br>One-�fifth of the prewar population of Poland in September 1939 was dead by the Second World War&#x2019;s end, victims of combat, malnutrition, disease, random murder&#x2014;�and the extermination camps, the greatest of which, Auschwitz-�Birkenau, pioneered industrialized mass murder thirty-�five miles to the west of Krak�w, inside that part of the Second Polish Republic that had been absorbed into the German Reich. But any hope that Krak�w, and Poland, would be restored to freedom by the defeat of German National Socialism was dashed by the British and American agreement, at the Tehran and Yalta conferences, to give Stalin and the Soviet Union effective control over postwar Poland. World War II, Poles came to say, was &#x201c;the war we lost twice.&#x201d;</p><h2>Baseball Training: The Pros&#39; Guide to Becoming Bigger, Faster, Stronger</h2><p><p>Having spent the past four years recording hundreds of training sessions by some of Major League Baseball&#x2019;s best athletes, the editors of STACK have built a library of grueling workouts, training secrets, and nutritional tips used by America's professional diamond greats.

Yet much of this revision has been in the form of piecemeal modification. In his latest work, Habermas has returned to the study of capitalism, incorporating the distinctive modifications of the Frankfurt School into the foundations of the critique of capitalism. Drawing on both systems theory and phenomenological sociology as well as Marxism, the author distinguishes four levels of capitalist crisis - economic, rationality, legitimation, and motivational crises. In his analysis, all the Frankfurt focus on cultural, personality, and authority structures finds its place, but in a systematic framework. At the same time, in his sketch of communicative ethics as the highest stage in the internal logic of the evolution of ethical systems, the author hints at the source of a new political practice that incorporates the imperatives of evolutionary rationality.</p><p>Through Jurgen Habermas&#39;s detailed criticism of positivist epistemology and methodology and his careful, undogmatic articulation of insights drawn from an immense knowledge of the German philosophical and sociological traditions, he made a lasting contribution to he critical reception of Anglo-American empiricism into German thought.J�rgen Habermas, professor of philosophy at the University of Frankfurt, has been hailed as the &#34;foremost social and political thinker in Germany today&#34; (Times Literary Supplement).

She was a well-known sculptor in bronze of animals, frontier women, and other Western subjects&#x2014;and a beautiful, young-looking woman in her fifties with a soft, sibilant voice.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Marlo Goble. How are you today?&#x201d;<br><br>Veryl Goodnight&#x2019;s heart jumped. Dr. Marlo Goble was a famous orthopedic surgeon with many medical patents to his credit, and a collector of Veryl&#x2019;s art as well. But at the moment his key credential was that he owned the Medicine Lodge Buffalo Ranch in Idaho, just west of Yellowstone National Park. It was traditional buffalo country and the site of one of the most famous buffalo jumps, where, for thousands of years, the Plains Indians had hunted buffalo en masse by stampeding them off a bluff.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay,&#x201d; Veryl said. &#x201c;How are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m just fine. How&#x2019;s Roger?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just fine. He&#x2019;s out in the barn with the horses.&#x201d; She glanced out the window of the studio with its Spanish tile floor and high ceiling.

The lady postman found him yesterday wandering down by the fence on my property.&#x201d;<br><br>Finally, she thought. With birthing season almost over, she had just about given up hope. It had been three months since Veryl had written letters to five buffalo ranchers in the West, men who knew her and her work, asking them to let her know if and when they had a &#x201c;bottle baby&#x201d;&#x2014;an orphaned buffalo who needed a temporary human home. Unlike genetically compromised, bred-to-be-docile cattle, mature buffalo cows were extremely self-sufficient, rarely died in childbirth, and even more rarely abandoned their young.<br><br>&#x201c;What happened to the mother?&#x201d; she asked, her eyes gliding over the sculpture of three wolves she was working on. Something wasn&#x2019;t right. Like any artist, she saw hundreds of flaws where a bystander would see only the miracle of an animal come to life in clay.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet my cowboys were moving the herd to another pasture and they didn&#x2019;t notice that one of the cows had given birth. The little guy must&#x2019;ve gotten left behind. By the time we found him, the herd was already miles away. It&#x2019;s a shame, but the good news is that he got a day of nursing in. That&#x2019;ll stand him in good stead. You&#x2019;re welcome to come up and take him home for a while.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, sure,&#x201d; Veryl said. &#x201c;Absolutely. Let me find out when Roger can fly us up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Veryl,&#x201d; Marlo said, &#x201c;this one&#x2019;s a fighter, but I can&#x2019;t guarantee you he&#x2019;s going to make it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; she replied, although she didn&#x2019;t know. It had never occurred to her that she might get a baby buffalo who wouldn&#x2019;t survive.<br><br>&#x201c;First thing you need to do is go out and load up on powdered goat&#x2019;s milk, &#x2019;cause this little guy can sure suck the heck out of a half- gallon bottle. But, with any luck, at least now you can start that piece of yours.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That piece&#x201d; was a sculpture of a nineteenth-century rancher&#x2019;s wife bottle-feeding a couple of baby buffalo. Not just any rancher&#x2019;s wife, and not just any rancher either. Her name was Mary Ann Dyer and she had married a great-great uncle of Veryl&#x2019;s named Charles Goodnight. Veryl had known for years about her ancestor&#x2019;s illustrious career as a pioneering cattle rancher in the Texas panhandle. Goodnight was the subject of biographies, a stern but just presence in countless books on the American frontier. However, it wasn&#x2019;t until the past December, when a friend mailed her an article from Texas Highways magazine, that Veryl had learned that Charles and Mary Ann Goodnight had done something quite extraordinary: they had helped save the American buffalo from total annihilation in the 1870s. Veryl almost immediately decided to immortalize in bronze what Charles and Mary Ann had done for all buffalo. To do that, she needed a buffalo calf, and a very, very young one at that.<br><br>She worked almost exclusively from life. For the trio of wolves she was finishing now, she had made three or four trips to the Candy Kitchen Wolf Refuge near the Zuni pueblo in southwestern New Mexico, where she had observed full-blooded wolves that had been rescued, in many cases, from humans who erroneously thought that they might make nice pets. The wolves were the most difficult subjects she&#x2019;d ever undertaken. They looked so much like dogs that it was hard to capture their &#x201c;wolfness.&#x201d; Making a wolf that looked like a dog was easy; making a wolf that looked like a wolf was not. Veryl looked over at Mickey, their Jack Russell terrier puppy, who was lying uncharacteristically still on a rug, snoozing in a patch of sunlight next to Luke, their German shepherd. Except for the occasional twitching leg, neither of them had moved a muscle in over an hour. A statue of sleeping dogs, Veryl thought&#x2014;now that would be a piece of cake.<br><br>As for a buffalo calf, she knew he would be able to model for her right in her studio, as long as it was bottle-nursing, so she could symbolize the remarkable moment in American history when a few humans had nursed a species back from the brink of extinction.<br><br>Veryl walked down to the barn, where Roger was feeding his horse Kepler, who shared the barn with Matt Dillon, his other horse, and Veryl&#x2019;s horse Toddy. As she watched him from outside the stall, she thought, even after thirteen years of marriage: how lucky can one girl be?<br><br>Roger, retired now for several years as a commercial airline pilot, was a handsome, big-boned man, over six feet, thick as a linebacker, with a lightly freckled face red from the sun and a boyish head of graying blond hair. No one would be surprised to learn that he had once flown secret missions in Laos for the CIA, or had a first-degree black belt in karate, or still played competitive soccer. He looked like just the sort of man you&#x2019;d want by your side in a war or mudslide or barroom brawl. He was exactly the kind of airline pilot you were glad to see smiling by the cockpit door as you boarded his plane.<br><br>Roger had a wry sense of humor that he indulged on rare occasions. His particular mix of openness and reserve made him entirely familiar and unknowable at the same time. When he confided in you, you were only more aware of what he wasn&#x2019;t telling you.<br><br>Roger had a gift for reading people quickly and could usually figure out within a few sentences who was capable of a real exchange of ideas and who just wanted to hear himself talk. As a result, he rarely found himself in a conversation he didn&#x2019;t want to be in, which saved him a lot of words. He knew how to turn aside insipid salesmen and ranting strangers with a smile. Roger hadn&#x2019;t married until his forties, back in the late 1980s. He was waiting for the right woman to come along. She turned out to be Veryl Goodnight, then in her late thirties, who had obviously been waiting for the right man.<br><br>&#x201c;Guess what?&#x201d; she asked, beaming.<br><br>Roger turned from Kepler and sized up her excitement. &#x201c;You got a baby bison?&#x201d; It was just like him, one step ahead of everyone else.<br><br>&#x201c;Marlo Goble just called. The calf&#x2019;s only a couple of days old and Marlo wants us to come up and get him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ll do,&#x201d; Roger said.<br><br>Helped along by an MBA earned long ago at Arizona State, Roger ran the business-and-marketing end of Goodnight Fine Arts, managing everything from balancing the books and negotiating the contracts with foundries and collectors to handling mailings about Veryl&#x2019;s upcoming shows. He was as comfortable with the industrialists who bought sculptures as the crane operators who lowered them into place.<br><br>A couple of days after Goble&#x2019;s call, and all because of what had happened 125 years before in the Texas panhandle, Veryl Goodnight, Roger, and Mickey the Jack Russell terrier climbed into the turquoise- copper-and-white Cessna Conquest twin-engine turbo-prop that Roger co- owned and flew two hours north-by-northwest, biting off the northeast corner of Utah and the southwest corner of Wyoming before landing in Idaho Falls. Marlo Goble picked them up and drove them for hours up the long valley before turning onto the dirt road leading to his Medicine Lodge Buffalo Ranch. When they got out of the car, Doris Brienholt, a petite blonde who managed the ranch with her husband Stuart, was already coming toward them with her border collie. Behind them, bouncing along like just another member of the family, was an animal not much bigger than a golden retriever, and with almost the same coloring&#x2014;a rusty red body and a honey-colored face. If it weren&#x2019;t for his broad black nose, he could have been mistaken for the long-legged family dog.<br><br>Mickey the Jack Russell, appointing himself chairman of the greeting committee, dashed up to the calf, got on his hind legs, and kissed him on the muzzle. Veryl came up behind Mickey, knelt, and took the calf&#x2019;s soft face in her hands. &#x201c;Hi, sweetie,&#x201d; she said, surprised by a lick in the face. It was difficult to believe that the animal had been in his mother&#x2019;s womb less than a week before, and that, if he survived, he would someday become a shaggy two-thousand-pound example of one of the greatest, most haunted, and certainly most hunted species ever.<br><br>They stayed three days. Marlo, Roger, and Veryl rode out on horseback to look at Marlo&#x2019;s herd. Somewhere in that woolly mass of bison was a mother perhaps still wondering what had happened to her newborn. Back at the house, Doris taught Roger and Veryl how to mix the formula. In the wild, orphaned calves attach themselves to anything large and moving&#x2014;as Meriwether Lewis had found out two hundred years before on his and William Clark&#x2019;s expedition, when a young bison attached himself to him for an entire afternoon. It was easy to see by the way the week-old calf nursed contentedly at Doris&#x2019;s side that he had imprinted on her. The trick now was to transfer the imprinting onto Veryl and Roger, a process helped immensely each time one of them showed the calf a half-gallon bottle of powdered goat&#x2019;s milk. As Veryl struggled to hold the bottle while the calf bunted and pulled, she saw that Marlo hadn&#x2019;t been joking about the week-old calf&#x2019;s appetite.<br><br>When it was time for Roger and Veryl to leave with the buffalo, Doris was so sad to see him go that she refused to make the drive back to the airport. On the airstrip, the calf polished off a bottle before Roger and Marlo herded him into a dog crate and loaded him into the cabin of the eight-passenger Conquest. Roger slid two of the chairs back on their tracks to make room. As Roger taxied for takeoff, Veryl sat next to the crate and reached through the bars to give the calf a pacifier, for which he thanked her with a soft grunt. By the time they reached the end of the runway, the calf was already asleep. Roger banked over Idaho Falls, headed south, and climbed to 27,000 feet, no doubt the altitude record for a week-old buffalo. Other than that, the flight was uneventful.<br><br>They decided to name him Charlie.<br><br>ttwo<br><br>Charlie&#x2019;s namesake, Charles Goodnight, saw his first buffalo as a nine-year-old boy in the 1840s along the banks of the Trinity River, today the site of downtown Dallas. Like most people, he had been fascinated by their strength and staggering numbers. By the 1870s, Goodnight had been a Texas Ranger, legendary trail driver, cattle rancher and breeder, and inventor of the chuck wagon&#x2014;and was well on his way to being widely acknowledged as &#x201c;Father of the Texas Panhandle.&#x201d; Cattleman though he was, he was troubled by how rapidly the buffalo were disappearing; Goodnight realized that a world that had existed for thousands of years&#x2014;a world that had belonged to the Indian and the buffalo&#x2014;was coming to an end.<br><br>Once there had been 30 million buffalo in the United States, maybe 40. Some estimates (now considered by many to be grossly inflated) put the number as high as 80. Until 1860, even at the lowest number, there were more buffalo in America than people. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark had found it impossible &#x201c;to calculate the moving multitude which darkened the whole plains.&#x201d; Another observer was more poetic: &#x201c;The world looked like one robe.&#x201d; The country was teeming with buffalo, herds of them hundreds of thousands strong, a vast shaggy carpet of buffalo miles long and miles wide. On first seeing them, men were apt to rub their eyes and question their sanity. There were places where the buffalo weren&#x2019;t just on the land; they seemed to be the land. If you couldn&#x2019;t see them, you could hear them coming, well in advance, an apocalypse on hooves. Sometimes it took days for them to run past a fixed point. Some claimed you could have walked ten miles across their backs without ever touching the ground. In his memoir, the prolific buffalo hunter J. Wright Mooar estimated the Southern herd in the millions. &#x201c;For five days,&#x201d; he wrote of a hunting trip in 1873, &#x201c;we had ridden through and camped in a mobile sea of living buffalo.&#x201d; For much of the nineteenth century, trying to calculate their number was a favorite pastime of hunters, settlers, naturalists, and<br><br>soldiers.<br><br>Over the millennia, since the last Ice Age, the buffalo had come over the Bering Land Bridge from Asia, spreading east and south. Into the nineteenth century, they roamed what are now all the states in the continental United States except Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine. When the British explored Virginia in 1733, they found hordes of wild buffalo, &#x201c;so gentle and undisturbed&#x201d; that men could almost pet them. By the 1830s, however, the buffalo that had once roamed the East Coast from New York to Georgia had been virtually eliminated by Indians, colonists, weather, and disease.<br><br>By the 1840s, the buffalo population in the West had been whittled down as well. The buffalo on the west side of the Continental Divide were already gone, victims of the heavily trafficked Oregon Trail, with its endless wagon trains full of hungry settlers. That left the tens of millions of buffalo on the short- and long-grass prairies, but their days were numbered too.</p><h2>The House on Olive Street</h2><p><strong>When a group of writers loses a member, a summer spent sorting through her things offers the perfect escape for the friends who loved and miss her.</strong><br><br>Sable has everything and her bestselling novels have made her a star.

Playing off George Eastman's own famous recipe for lemon meringue pie, as well as former director Beaumont Newhall's love of food, the cookbook grew from the idea that photographers' talent in the darkroom must also translate into special skills in the kitchen. The recipes do not disappoint, with Robert Adams' Big Sugar Cookies, Ansel Adams' Poached Eggs in Beer, Richard Avedon's Royal Pot Roast, Imogen Cunningham's Borscht, William Eggleston's Cheese Grits Casserole, Stephen Shore's Key Lime Pie Supreme and Ed Ruscha's Cactus Omelette, to name a few. The book was never published, and the materials have remained in George Eastman Museum's collection ever since. Now, nearly 40 years later, this extensive and distinctive archive of untouched recipes and photographs is published in <i>The Photographer's Cookbook</i> for the first time. The book provides a time capsule of contemporary photographers of the 1970s&#x2014;many before they made a name for themselves&#x2014;as well as a fascinating look at how they depicted food, family and home, taking readers behind the camera and into the hearts and stomachs of some of photography's most important practitioners.</p><p>Lisa Hostetler is curator of photography at George Eastman Museum, Rochester, New York.

He&#39;s so consistent and professional, so in tune with the author&#39;s thinking that most listeners will simply devour the wealth of information and not even think about the talent of the messenger. Cashman is a reasonably positive interpreter, an improvement over the author&#39;s overenthusiasm when he lectures or reads. The material explains what parts of the brain cause familiar behaviors, and the complexity of this kind of science is kept grounded with engaging case histories.

What have wisdom, prudence and studiousness to do with justifying our beliefs? Jay Wood begins this introduction to epistemology by taking an extended look at the idea of knowing within the context of the intellectual virtues. He then surveys current views of foundationalism, epistemic justification and reliabilism. Finally he examines the relationship of epistemology to religious belief, and the role of emotions and virtues in proper cognitive functioning Professors will find this text, with its many examples drawn from everyday student experience, especially useful in introducing students to the formal study of epistemology.</p><p>W.

Although MITI was not the only important agent affecting the economy, nor was the state as a whole always predominant, I do not want to be overly modest about the importance of this subject. The particular speed, form, and consequences of Japanese economic growth are not intelligible without reference to the contributions of MITI. Collaboration between the state and big business has long been acknowledged as the defining characteristic of the Japanese economic system, but for too long the state's role in this collaboration has been either condemned as overweening or dismissed as merely supportive, without anyone's ever analyzing the matter.<br>The history of MITI is central to the economic and political history of modern Japan. Equally important, however, the methods and achievements of the Japanese economic bureaucracy are central to the continuing debate between advocates of the communist-type command economies and advocates of the Western-type mixed market economies. The fully bureaucratized command economies misallocate resources and stifle initiative; in order to function at all, they must lock up their populations behind iron curtains or other more or less impermeable barriers. The mixed market economies struggle to find ways to intrude politically determined priorities into their market systems without catching a bad case of the "English disease" or being frustrated by the American-type legal sprawl. The Japanese, of course, do not have all the answers. But given the fact that virtually all solutions to any of the critical problems of the late twentieth century&#x2015;energy supply, environmental protection, technological innovation, and so forth&#x2015;involve an expansion of official bureaucracy, the particular Japanese priorities and procedures are instructive. At the very least they should forewarn a foreign observer that the Japanese achievements were not won without a price being paid.</p><p>"There are, unfortunately, few books on Japanese politics and economics that deserve to be widely recommended to nonspecialists from either discipline, let alone to the generally informed public. Happily, Chalmers Johnson's excellent study is one of those rare gems that will demand attention from wide audiences. It is a sparkling addition to scholarship and literacy." &#x2014;T. J. Pempel,Political Science Quarterly</p><h2>Field Guide to Environmental Engineering for Development Workers: Water, Sanitation, and Indoor Air</h2><p>Throughout the world, and even in the United States, engineers are tackling the challenges of sustainable development and public health - challenges that engineers are uniquely qualified to address. Yet engineers working abroad on development projects often lack the knowledge and information to design, plan, construct, operate, and maintain technology that is culturally, economically, and geographically appropriate - technology that takes into account gender, does not use significant amounts of fossil fuels, accounts for environmental conditions like water scarcity, and uses local construction materials. This readable and fully illustrated guide is a complete handbook for international engineering service projects that involve water supply and treatment, watersheds, sanitation systems, and indoor air quality. It provides the tools necessary to implement the right technology in developing regions around the world. The authors introduce sustainable engineering and explain how environmental engineering fosters public health, with an emphasis on the relationship between community participation and the success of an engineering project. In addition, this book covers topographical surveying, project planning, watershed management, and construction materials and techniques. Specific technical guidance is offered for the design and construction of multiple systems for water supply, water and wastewater treatment, and flood storage and drainage, as well as solid waste management and indoor air quality improvement. This book is a valuable resource for engineering students, faculty, and practitioners involved with programs like Engineers without Borders, Water for People, and Engineers for a Sustainable World, as well as those affiliated with government groups, international agencies, and charitable organizations.</p><p>James R.

Brian Barkdoll, Ph.D., P.E., D.WRE, F.ASCE is an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Michigan Technological University.Book titles occasionally include the term field guide in a euphemistic sense, and such works very rarely are actually used in the trenches. With Field Guide to Environmental Engineering for Development Workers, however, a more literal take is in order. Indeed, on the inside front cover the reader will find a checklist of steps to be taken to avoid diarrhea. With a large team of authors and contributors, most of whom spent time in the Peace Corps, this book is nothing less than a how-to guide for applying engineering know-how to help people in the developing world gain access to clean water and achieve higher standards of sanitation. A foreword by the former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, our volunteer in chief, underlines the importance of the mission at hand. The guide is densely packed with straightforward, practical black-andwhite illustrations and sketches, many of them showing the construction and operation of various facets of infrastructure that we in the developed world tend to take for granted. Proper construction of pipeline crossings, assessing the status of a wastewater lagoon by interpreting the color of its water, and understanding how to increase the capacity of a gravity-fed water system are among the many topics covered in this work. Field Guide is meant to be, as much as possible, accessible to those who are not engineers but want to do their part in helping people who are less fortunate. Engineers may not be impressed by the sophistication of the technology described, but they are sure to be sobered by the realization that the basic needs of so many millions of people around the world are not being met. And those working to meet those needs will simply find it a godsend. --This review appeared in the December 2009 (vol.79, issue 12) of Civil Engineering.

Antoine dreamed of flying and grew up to be a pilot&#x2015;and that was when his adventures began. He found a job delivering mail by plane, which had never been done before. He and his fellow pilots traveled to faraway places and discovered new ways of getting from one place to the next. Antoine flew over mountains and deserts. He battled winds and storms. He tried to break aviation records, and sometimes he even crashed. From his plane, Antoine looked down on the earth and was inspired to write about his life and his pilot-hero friends in memoirs and in fiction. Peter S�s's remarkable biography celebrates the author of <i>The Little Prince</i>, one of the most beloved books in the world. This title has Common Core connections.</p><p><b>A Frances Foster Book</b></p></p><p><b>Peter S�s </b>is the internationally renowned author and/or illustrator of many books for children. He received Caldecott Honors for <i>Starry Messenger</i>, <i>Tibet Through the Red Box</i>, and <i>Wall: Growing Up Behind the Iron Curtain</i>. He is the recipient of the 2012 Hans Christian Andersen Award for Illustration and the 2015 Society of Illustrators Lifetime Achievement Award, and has also been awarded a MacArthur Fellowship. He has lived in and around New York City since 1984.Gr 4 Up&#x2014;As in his works about other restless souls who charted their courses by the stars and pondered big questions (Columbus, Galileo, Darwin), S�s's picture-book biography of the famous French aviator and author comprises multiple layers. Trim but informative sentences ground the pages where text appears ("When he was four years old, his father died unexpectedly. The boy wondered, Where did he go?"). Sensitive readers will follow that question into the heart of the story that encompasses Saint-Exup�ry's childhood, passion for flying, experiences with military and commercial planes, multiple crashes, risk-taking temperament, friendships, marriage, and publications. Dates, places, events, and exploits swirl around smaller images framed cleverly with bubbles, sequential panels, maps, or airplanes. The emotional content comes through the changing colors and compositions of S�s's exquisite double spreads. Many are wordless, as when the pilot stands at the edge of the vast turquoise ocean; above the horizon, twinkling yellow stars form the curls and eyes of the title character of The Little Prince. S�s is as adept at drama (the red paint bleeding from the sky as the Germans bomb France) as he is at subtle humor (an aerial view of Manhattan portrays the city as an alligator-shaped landmass emerging from a sewer). Slyly inserted referents, from an elephant inside a "hat" to a M�li�s moon, add meaning. S�s's handling of the aviator's last flight and disappearance strikes just the right notes of mystery, majesty, and quiet wonder that connect the life and longings of Saint-Exup�ry to those of his young, fictional friend.

Relying on his own letters home and recollections he penned just after his discharge, Webster gives a first hand account of life in <i>E Company, 101st Airborne Division</i>, crafting a memoir that resonates with the immediacy of a gripping novel. From the beaches of Normandy to the blood-dimmed battlefields of Holland, here are acts of courage and cowardice, moments of irritating boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror, and pitched urban warfare. Offering a remarkable snapshot of what it was like to enter Germany in the last days of World War II, Webster presents a vivid, varied cast of young paratroopers from all walks of life, and unforgettable glimpses of enemy soldiers and hapless civilians caught up in the melee.

In the years following the Mexican Revolution, she captured a profoundly transformative moment for the country&#x2019;s land, architecture, and people. She remains best known for these works and for her portraits of prominent modernists working in Mexico, including Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, and David Alfaro Siqueiros. <i>Lola �lvarez Bravo&nbsp;</i>delves into a lesser-known body of work, in which attention to pattern, light, and abstraction guides the artist&#x2019;s depictions of urban and rural landscapes and their inhabitants. It also addresses her role in building and securing the legacy of the post-Revolutionary period, her dialogue with modernist photographers, and her place within the broader cultural sphere, offering new insight into the mutual influence she shared with prominent painters, filmmakers, and literary figures of her time.</p><p>A beautifully illustrated look at modernist photographer Lola �lvarez Bravo&#x2019;s contribution to Mexico&#x2019;s cultural renaissance, this volume traces her work as an artist, political activist, educator, and curator.<p><b>Stephanie Weissberg</b> is assistant curator at the Pulitzer Arts Foundation, St. Louis. <b>Karen Cordero Reiman</b> is an art historian and curator based in Mexico City and professor emerita, Universidad Iberoamericana.</p></p><h2>The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi &amp; QiGong Illustrated, Fourth Edition</h2><p>Nearly 150 web videos support this new fourth edition of The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi &amp; QiGong's richly detailed 300 illustrations, giving it a highly effective how-to focus. Tai Chi is a gentle extremely low-impact movement and meditation program that slows the aging process and enhances the body's natural healing powers.

Using traditional Japanese and European woodcut techniques, Killion has created stunning visual images of the Sierra that focus on the backcountry above nine thousand feet, accessible only on foot. Accompanying these riveting images are the journals of Gary Snyder, chronicling more than forty years of travels through the High Sierra backcountry.</p><p>This edition of *The High Sierra of California* was adapted from the handprinted book that Tom Killion produced during the period from 1997-2000 at his Quail Press studio in Santa Cruz. The original edition was limited to 129 copies, printed on handmade Japanese papers in a folio format measuring about fifteen by twenty inches, with illustrations printed from Killion's hand-carved wood and linoleum blocks. Each section opened with a decorative Japanese paper to evoke the season and closed with a full-page woodcut image. Collectors immediately acquuired all available copies, and Killionhas since decided to make the book available to the general public. Artfully designed and adapted to the new format, and enhanced with additional excerpts from the backpacking journals of Gary Snyder, *The High Sierra of California* is, in Killion's words, "a richer book, both visually and textually, and very pleasing to the bookmaker in me." <p>*The High Sierra of California* also features excerpts from Gary Snyder's backpacking journals, covering nearly forty years of exploration--personal and spiritual as well as geographic--in the high country.</p>Woodcut and letterpress artist Tom Killion grew up in Marin County, California, on the slopes of Mt. Tamalpais, where the rugged scenery inspired him from an early age to create landscape prints strongly influenced by traditional Japanese woodblock prints. Along with publishing fine art letterpress books, Killion holds a PhD in African history from Stanford University and has taught history at several Bay Area universities. He is the founder of The Quail Press and his extensively illustrated books include <i>28 Views of Mount Tamalpais</i>, <i>The Coast of California</i>, and <i>Walls: A Journey Across Three Continents</i>.

The backdrop of the hurricane-ravaged Gulf Coast is a versatile setting for Burke&#x2019;s stories, which cover the scope of the human experience&#x2014;from love and sex to domestic abuse to war, death, and friendship.</p><p>James Lee Burke is a&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author, two-time winner of the Edgar Award, and the recipient of the Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Arts in Fiction. He&#x2019;s authored thirty-seven&nbsp;novels and two short story collections.&nbsp;He lives in Missoula, Montana.Burke's celebrated Dave Robicheaux mystery series hinges on encounters between the powerless and the powerful; the powerless usually lose, of course, but at least they have New Iberia, Louisiana, policeman Robicheaux to fight some of their battles for them. The 11 stories in this collection of Burke's short fiction also dramatize what happens when poor people are trapped in the vice of circumstances beyond their control, but here there is no Robicheaux to come to their aid. Although some of the stories concern individuals caught in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina--the ultimate circumstance beyond one's control--the majority are set in the past, usually rural Louisiana or Mississippi in the late 1940s. Whether the lead characters are abused children or prostitutes trying to escape the life, Burke always makes us see both the near certainty of tragedy to come and the smoldering embers of possibility in the ashes of blighted lives. He is both a deeply romantic and an unremittingly realistic writer, and it is in that tension that his lyrical prose takes flight: "But even in the middle of an Indian summer's day, when the sugarcane is beaten with purple and gold light in the fields, . . . I have to mourn just a moment for those people of years ago who lived lives they did not choose, who carried burdens that were not their own." <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

As he says, &#x201c;The season never does officially end here, but it ends effectively, which means you can fish if you want to and if you can stand it, but you don&#x2019;t have to.&#x201d; As any Gierach fan knows, want to and have to are never very far apart.</p><p>John Gierach is the author of&nbsp;more than twenty books about fly-fishing. His writing has appeared in&nbsp;<i>Field &amp; Stream, Gray&#x2019;s Sporting Journal</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Fly Rod &amp; Reel</i>, where he is a regular columnist. He also writes a column for the monthly&nbsp;<i>Redstone Review</i>. He lives in Lyons, Colorado.&nbsp;<b>Chapter Five</b> <p> Have you ever started reminiscing with a friend about a fishing trip and found that you remember things differently? I have. Now and then it's downright puzzling, but usually it just amounts to slightly different versions of the same story, as when one witness says the mugger was five eleven and another says he was six one, but they both pick the same guy out of the lineup. Mike and A.K. have both mentioned things about that last trip to Pennsylvania that I don't remember. That's not to say they didn't happen, just that they didn't register with me, or maybe they happened while I was in the bushes taking a leak. Some of the things I recall have also drawn blank looks from them, although with me being a writer and all, the assumption is that I'm imagining things. </p><p> It's a common prejudice and one that's probably not entirely unfounded. After all, someone once defined fiction as just something a writer made up and nonfiction as just something a writer made up using the names of real people. More to the point, novelist John Irving once said that a memoir is, by definition, what the author remembers, not necessarily what happened. </p><p> You can go to your fishing journal to prove things like the year, the month, the weather, the hatches, the name of the guide, and maybe the weight of a big fish if someone bothered to bring along a scale. But if you're like me, the things that stick aren't written down. And memory is flawed. Fishermen know that better than anyone, we just don't always know how much. </p><p> We do know how it happens, though: You land a nice fat sixteen-inch cutthroat that the guide you're with swears is twenty inches long. You know what he's doing and you know why he's doing it, but unless there's a tape measure handy, you don't know it beyond a shadow of a doubt -- and he is a professional, after all -- so you say, modestly, honestly, "It ain't over eighteen." </p><p> Or let's say you're fishing a mountain creek that's known for small brook trout, but you've hiked way up in there where, you've heard, there are some deep holes and the fish are bigger. They are, and there are lots of them; they're easy to catch, and it's a beautiful, cool, rainy day with the spruce forest so lush and green you feel like you're fishing through an enormous salad. Maybe you see a golden crowned kinglet perched on a twig no more than a foot away, and then later you glance upstream and spot a huge mule deer buck in velvet. You're doing well enough that you quickly lose track of how many fish you catch, and although you admire the biggest, handsomest ones, you don't measure them. The walk out is long but downhill and pretty much effortless. </p><p> Back home they say, "How'd you do?" and you say, "Good," which is true enough so far. But then they say, "Yeah, but how many and how big?" You give an accurate estimate, carefully paring away all the beauty and good feeling and getting right down to nothing but bare facts, right? </p><p> The same thing can happen when you tell someone about an argument you had last week. There's some emotion loose in the story -- a different kind than you get from fishing, but emotion nonetheless -- and you've had a while to stew about it. When you quote yourself as saying not so much what you really said, but what you should have said, you may be vaguely aware of it at the time, but the moment it's out of your mouth it becomes the truth. The thing is, fishing stories, war stories, and love stories are all the same: There's more there than just the facts, and when the facts get in the way, they can become expendable. </p><p> It works in reverse, too. Most years I fish a lot; maybe not as much as some, but more than most. At the end of a good season I'll have fishing licenses from four or five states and a couple of Canadian provinces, some worn-out fly lines, near-empty fly boxes, a born-again thriftiness, and a good tan. But then on one of those cold, solitary late-November walks, I'll get to thinking about that one beaver pond I never made it to and think, What the hell did I do all year, sit on my ass? </p><p> And of course fishermen hear what they want to hear. Maybe you say, "Well, I got a five-pounder, but just the one. Most of them were more like a pound and a half or smaller, but it was real pretty, and there was no one around, and the guide was a real comedian. And that five-pounder was something. Here's a picture of him." </p><p> The guy looks at the snapshot and envisions a river crammed with five-pounders -- so many you could cross from bank to bank on their backs and not get your feet wet. You can see it in his eyes. If he ends up going there himself, he'll come back and say, "It wasn't as good as you said it was." </p><p> I've given this some thought, and I think my standard recollection of fishing is made up of the emotion of the moment, the mood of the day, the scenery, the company, the weather, who I am, who I think I am, who I'd like to be, my own sense of poetry, and a few tattered shreds of what actually happened. As James P. Carse once said, "What we see depends partly on what is there and partly on who is looking." </p><p> Maybe I'm the only one who does it that way, but I don't think so. </p><p> I once fished with a man on a good local river. We weren't exactly in each other's hip pockets, but we were within sight all afternoon, close enough to shout encouragement or trot over to look at an especially pretty fish. And the trout there really are pretty. They're bright rainbows with wide red stripes and a strain of cutthroat in their lineage that gives them iridescent gill covers and orange slashes on their jaws. </p><p> The way I remember it, I caught six or eight trout, the biggest maybe fifteen inches. He got about a dozen and his biggest was an honest seventeen, measured from little finger to little finger on two outstretched palms, which on me is just a hair under eighteen inches. And we did it all on size 18 Blue-winged Olive duns and emergers, which somehow makes it better. </p><p> But then at a cafe on the way home, a guy at the next table spotted us for fishermen and asked how we'd done. My partner said he'd caught no less than thirty trout, including several that were at least twenty inches, if not longer. He believed it. He looked at me with big chipmunk cheeks and the most innocent smile I've ever seen and said, "Right?" </p><p> I said, "Yeah, right. The guy kicked ass," thinking: Okay, I know he did better than me, but did I underestimate my own performance that much? Not likely. Fishermen don't do that. </p><p> I don't think he was knowingly lying, either. We weren't close friends, but he hadn't struck me as one of those chronic bullshitters (he actually seemed a little on the shy side), and he'd have no reason to think I'd back him up in a god-awful lie to a stranger. </p><p> Out in the parking lot I waited for him to say, "Man, we really pulled that guy's leg, didn't we?" but he never said it. What he said was, "That was one of the best days of fishing I ever had." </p><p> We all think we're good observers, or at least that we can believe our own eyes, but few of us have ever been tested. I had a philosophy professor back in college who staged a great demonstration on the relationship of facts to experience. In the middle of a normal class one day, several people stormed into the room, got into a loud argument with the professor -- complete with swearing and shoving -- over who was supposed to have the room scheduled for that hour. Then they stormed back out and slammed the door loudly behind them. It had been sudden, surprising, and borderline violent, sort of like catching a big fish. </p><p> The professor turned to us and said, "Okay, write down your best account of what just happened." </p><p> Naturally, it had all been scripted and rehearsed with some people from the drama department, so he knew every gesture and word. There were twenty of us in class and the elapsed time between the actual events and our retelling of them worked out to a matter of minutes. None of us got it right, and better than half of us got it terribly wrong. </p><p> That was the year I finally realized that the nature of knowledge was such that you couldn't know anything for sure, but then if that were true, you also couldn't know for sure that you couldn't know anything. I finished up the semester and got my degree, but my career in philosophy was already over. </p><p> So maybe we can't even be sure that what happened five minutes ago is what actually happened, and the more time that passes the more you have to wonder. I think that's just a simple storage problem. People now like to think of their memories as computers with only so many bytes available, so that eventually you have to dump some old files to make room for all the new stuff coming along. </p><p> I'm more comfortable picturing my mind as a rolltop desk with only so many drawers and cubbyholes, but the same principle applies. Consciously or not, you hold on to what seems best and treat the rest as junk mail. Eventually a trip where a few big fish were caught becomes a trip where nothing <i>but</i> big fish were caught. And how big were they? Well, the guide said even the little ones were twenty inches. </p><p> Of course, all those countless days when no fish were caught begin to dwindle to a single distilled example, so that, if pressed, you'd have to say you do remember getting skunked once, but you can't quite remember where or when. You don't do it on purpose, but eventually your life as you recall it becomes a work of fiction based loosely on actual events. </p><p> I've become more aware of all this as I've gotten older and the desk has gotten more cluttered, but I think I knew it in my twenties, too, because when an old fisherman once said to me, "Boy, I've forgotten more about fishing than you'll ever know," I didn't doubt it for a second. </p><p> Not long ago A.K. and I were sitting around on a back porch in Alberta, Canada, with some other fishermen telling some well-worn, thirty-year-old stories about our friend Koke Winter. Koke is legendary in some fly-fishing circles. He was A.K.'s mentor years ago back in Michigan, and he was never shy about it, either. Once someone asked Koke if he knew...</p></p><h2>A Book of Women Poets from Antiquity to Now: Selections from the World Over</h2><p>A monument to the literary genius of women throughout the ages, A Book of Women Poets from Antiquity to Now is an invaluable collection.

The text is addressed in part to Lightworkers, for whom the energy shift now gearing up has been ongoing for at least the last twenty years. The time is getting closer. The Great Shift is a progress report from the field and the messages are positive. &#34;You don&#39;t have to logically do anything but &#39;show up&#39; with spiritual intent, and the DNA quantum field is activated in your body,&#34; Kryon says. He tells us to expect changes and peace we may have never thought to see in our lifetimes, even in the Middle East. He says, &#34;God is not a controlling force. Look for the love.&#34; Tom Kenyon channeling the Hathors, a group consciousness entity, reminds us, &#34;It is your attention to an event that makes it conscious.&#34; Kenyon also explains what channeled material is, which is important in understanding how we co-create our own world: &#34;From the standpoint of neuropsychology, channeled information is just another expression of our brain/mind potential . . . a movement into the unknown territory of one&#39;s own psyche to see what emerges in terms of contact (with other intelligences) and information.&#34; The Hathors message for what is now and what is to come: &#34;It is so simple, it is forgotten. . . . Find a way to live your life in joy and happiness.&#34; Mary Magdalen, through Tom Kenyon, makes it clear that restoring the balance between male and female energies will mean good things for men as well as women and will reignite our creative potency. Patricia Cori channeling the High Council of Sirius reminds us that the future is never predetermined and the past is an illusion--different for each of us.</p><p>This extraordinary book brings together many sources of important information on the changes occurring within our world, ourselves, and the evolution of consciousness leading up to the year 2012.

The youngest of three sisters, Emily desperately wanted to prove herself. Success, though, came at the cost of leaving behind the man she loved.<br><br>For Boone Dorsett, losing Emily left his heart shattered, but another woman was waiting in the wings. Now a widower with a young son, Boone has a second chance with Emily when a storm brings her home. But with his former in-laws threatening a custody suit, the stakes of loving her are higher than ever.<br><br>Will fate once again separate them&#x2014;or is the time finally right for these two star-crossed lovers?<br><br></p><p>With her roots firmly planted in the South, Sherryl Woods has written many of her more than 100 books in that distinctive setting, whether in her home state of Virginia, her adopted state, Florida, or her much-adored South Carolina. Sherryl is best known for her ability to creating endearing small town communities and families. She is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of over 75 romances for Silhouette Desire and Special Edition.<br><br>The television in Emily Castle's Aspen, Colorado, hotel room was tuned to the Weather Channel, where there was minute-by-minute coverage of the hurricane aiming directly at North Carolina's coast, the place that had been like a second home to her. Childhood summers there had been slow and lazy and sweet. The beach town her grandmother called home was where she'd ultimately experienced her first heartache, yet despite those painful memories and despite everything she had on her plate at the moment, it was where she needed to be.<br><br>Even before her cell phone rang, she was checking flight schedules on her laptop. She clicked on a connecting flight between Atlanta and Raleigh, North Carolina, just as she answered the incoming call.<br><br>"Already on it," she told her sister Gabriella. "I should be able to get to Raleigh by sometime late tomorrow."<br><br>"Not a chance," Gabi argued. "Flights are going to be canceled up and down the East Coast for at least a day or two. You're better off waiting until next week and booking for Monday, maybe even Tuesday. Avoid the craziness."<br><br>"What's Samantha doing?" Emily asked, referring to their older sister.<br><br>"She's rented a car and is already on her way down from New York. She'll be here later tonight, hopefully ahead of the storm. They're predicting landfall overnight. We're already getting some of the wind and rain bands clear over here."<br><br>Of course Samantha would beat the storm! Emily couldn't seem to stop herself from frowning. Though she'd never totally understood it, the odd competitiveness she'd always felt with her oldest sister kicked in with a vengeance. She supposed with three sisters, there were bound to be rivalries, but why with Samantha and not Gabi? Gabi was the driven, successful businesswoman, the one most like her in terms of ambition.<br><br>"I'm getting on a flight out of here tonight," Emily said determinedly, motivated by Samantha's plans. "If I have to drive from Atlanta, then that's what I'll do."<br><br>Rather than admonishing her, Gabi chuckled. "Samantha said you were going to say that. From the time you understood the difference between winning and losing, you hated it when she beat you at anything. Okay, fine. Get here when you can. Just do it safely. This storm isn't looking pretty. If it wobbles even the slightest bit to the west, Sand Castle Bay will take a direct hit. You can bet the road down to Hatteras will wash out again unless they were a lot smarter when they did the repairs after the last storm."<br><br>"How's Grandmother?" Cora Jane Castle was in her mid-seventies but still going strong and determined to continue operating the beachfront restaurant opened by her late husband even though no one in the family had demonstrated any interest in running it. In Emily's view, she ought to sell it and enjoy her golden years, but the mere mention of such an idea was considered blasphemy.<br><br>"Stoic about the storm, but mad as a wet hen that Dad drove over and picked her up to bring her to Raleigh to ride out the hurricane," Gabi assessed. "She's in my kitchen cooking and muttering a few very bad words I had no idea she knew. I think that's why Dad dropped her here, then took off. He didn't want to be around when she got her hands on my knives."<br><br>"Or it could be he had no idea what to say to her. That's his way, isn't it?" Emily said with a hint of bitterness. Under the best of conditions, her father, Sam, wasn't communicative. Under the worst, he simply wasn't around. Most of the time she'd made her peace with that, but on occasion simmering resentments rose to the surface.<br><br>"He has work to do," Gabi said, immediately defensive, as always. "Important work. Do you know the kind of impact these biomedical studies at his company could have on people's lives?"<br><br>"I wonder how many times he said exactly that to Mother when he went off and left her to cope with raising us."<br><br>For once Gabi didn't overreact. "It was a constant refrain, wasn't it? Well, we're all grown-up. We should be over all those missed school plays and recitals and soccer games by now."<br><br>"Says the not-so-well-adjusted woman who's doing her best to follow in his footsteps," Emily taunted with good humor. "You know you're no better than he is, Gabriella. You may not be a scientist, but you are a workaholic. That's why you get so uptight when I criticize him."<br><br>The silence that greeted her comment was deafening. "Gabi, I was only teasing," Emily apologized, aware that she'd crossed a line. "Seriously. You know how proud we all are of your accomplishments. You're a top executive at one of the hottest biomed companies in North Carolina, if not the entire country."<br><br>"I know. You just struck a nerve, that's all," Gabi said, then added briskly, "Let me know when you're getting in and I'll pick you up at the airport, okay?"<br><br>Before Emily could offer another apology for what she had recognized as an insensitive, ill-timed remark, Gabriella had hung up. Not with the sort of clatter that would mirror Emily's own quick flares of temper, but quietly. Somehow that was much, much worse.<br><br>Boone Dorsett had been through his share of hurricane warnings and actual hits on the coast. He had the boarding-up routine down pat. But when it came right down to it, Mother Nature was always in control of the outcome.<br><br>As a kid he'd been awed by the ferocious storms, but he'd had little real understanding of the havoc they could wreak on people's lives. These days, with a son, a home and a busy restaurant, he had a far better grasp of what could be lost to high winds, devastating storm surges and flood waters. He'd seen roads washed out, houses toppled, lives uprooted.<br><br>Thankfully, this latest storm had taken a last-minute turn east and delivered only a glancing blow. There was damage, plenty of it in fact, but so far he hadn't seen the kind of destruction he'd witnessed in the past. In fact, it had been relatively kind to him. There'd been some flooding at his waterfront restaurant, a few shingles ripped off the roof at his home, but his biggest concern after checking out his own property had been for Cora Jane's family restaurant.<br><br>Castle's by the Sea had been a constant in his life, as had Cora Jane. Both had inspired him to go into the restaurant business, not to mimic Castle's success, but to create his own welcoming ambiance. He owed Cora Jane, too, for helping him to believe in himself when no one in his own dysfunctional family had.<br><br>The biggest reason for Castle's success, other than its proximity to the ocean, good food and friendly service, was Cora Jane's devotion to it. She'd called him half a dozen times since the storm had passed to see if he'd been allowed back into Sand Castle Bay. The minute the evacuation order had been lifted, he'd crossed the bridge from the mainland to check his property and hers.<br><br>Now, standing in the middle of the damp, debris-littered dining room at Castle's by the Sea, he called her with the damage assessment she'd been anxiously awaiting.<br><br>"How bad is it?" she asked, foregoing so much as a hello. "Tell me the truth, Boone. Don't you dare su-garcoat it."<br><br>"Could have been worse," he told her. "There was some flooding, but no worse than over at my place."<br><br>"Shame on me," Cora Jane interrupted. "I never even asked how you fared in the storm. Just some flooding?"<br><br>"That was the worst of it," he confirmed. "My crew's already cleaning up. They know the drill. As for the house, it's fine. So is yours. A lot of tree limbs in the yard, a few roof shingles ripped off, but otherwise it's all good."<br><br>"Thank heavens. Now finish telling me about Castle's."<br><br>Boone complied. "A couple of storm shutters stripped away and the windows blew in. You'll have to replace a few of these waterlogged tables and chairs, treat everything for mold, and paint, but all in all, it's not as bad as it could have been."<br><br>"The deck?"<br><br>"Still standing. Looks solid enough to me, but I'll have it checked."<br><br>"And the roof?"<br><br>Boone sucked in a breath. He hated delivering bad news and had deliberately put this off till last. "Now, I won't lie to you, Cora Jane, but the roof's looking pretty bad. Once the wind gets a hold on a few shingles, you know how it goes."<br><br>"Oh, I know well enough," she said, sounding stoic. "So, is it bad, as in a goner, or bad as in a few stray shingles came loose?"<br><br>He smiled. "I'd want to get Tommy Cahill over here to check it, but I'm thinking you'd be better off just getting the whole thing done. Shall I go ahead and call him? He owes me a favor. I think I can get him here before the day's out. I can call your insurance company and see about getting a cleaning crew in here, too."<br><br>"I'd be obliged if you could get Tommy over there, but I'll call the insurance people and there's no need for a cleaning crew," Cora Jane insisted. "I'll be back first thing tomorrow with the girls. With them pitching in, we can clean the place up in no time."<br><br>Boone's heart seemed to still at her words. <em>The girls</em> could only be her granddaughters, including the one who'd dumped him ten years ago and taken off to start a better life than she thought he'd be able to give her.<br><br>"Emily, too?" he asked, holding out a faint hope that she wouldn't be back here, in his face, testing his belief that he'd long ago gotten her out of his system.<br><br>"Of course," Cora Jane said, then added a little too gently, "Is that going to be a problem, Boone?"<br><br>"Of course not. Emily and me, that's in the past. The <em>distant</em> past," he added emphatically.<br><br>"Are you so sure about that?" she pressed.<br><br>"I moved on, married someone else, didn't I?" he said defensively.<br><br>"And lost Jenny way too soon," Cora Jane said, as if he needed reminding of his wife's death just over a year ago.<br><br>"But not our son," Boone said. "I still have B.J. to think about. He's my life these days."<br><br>"I know you're devoted to that boy, but you need more," she lectured. "You deserve to have a full and happy life."<br><br>"Someday maybe I'll find the kind of happiness you're talking about," Boone said, "but I'm not looking for it, and it sure as heck isn't going to be with a woman who didn't think I'd amount to much."<br><br>Cora Jane drew in a shocked breath. "Boone, that is not what happened. Emily never judged you and found you lacking. She just had all these pie-in-the-sky dreams for herself. She needed to leave here and test herself, see what she could accomplish."<br><br>"That's your spin. I saw it a little differently," Boone said. "Maybe we'd better not talk about Emily. We've stayed friends, you and me, by keeping her off-limits. She's family and you love her. Of course you'd defend her."<br><br>"You're family, too," Cora Jane insisted fiercely. "Or as good as."<br><br>Boone smiled. "You've always made me feel that way. Now let me make those calls and see what I can do to get this place back in working order before you get here. I know you're going to want to plug in the coffeepot and open the doors as soon as the power's back on. I should warn you that could be another couple of days. You maybe ought to consider staying with Gabi until it's fixed."<br><br>"I need to be there," Cora Jane replied determinedly. "Sitting around here and worrying isn't getting anything accomplished. I imagine we can get by on that generator you had installed after the last storm."<br><br>"I'll make sure it's working and check the refrigerators and freezer to make sure things stayed cold. Anything else you need me to do before you come home?"<br><br>"If Tommy gives you a fair estimate on the roof, tell him to get started, okay?"<br><br>"You have my word, he'll be fair," Boone assured her. "And you'll be first on his list. Like I said, he owes me."<br><br>"Then I'll see you tomorrow," Cora Jane said. "Thanks for checking on things for me."<br><br>"It's what family does," he replied, knowing it was a lesson he'd learned from Cora Jane, not from either of his own parents. Being supportive simply wasn't part of their makeup.<br><br>As he hung up, he couldn't help wondering if there would ever come a day when he'd not regret that his ties to Cora Jane and her family weren't of a far more permanent variety.<br><br>It took Emily two frustrating days to make all the right connections from Colorado to North Carolina. More annoying than the time wasted in airports was imagining Gabi's <em>I-told-you-so</em> when she finally landed in Raleigh on a clear day that bore no lingering evidence of the nasty weather that had blown through the state two days before.<br><br>But when she emerged from the airport with her carry-on luggage, it was Samantha who awaited her. Her big sister enveloped her in a fierce hug.<br><br>Though huge, fashionable sunglasses hid most of her face, and her artfully streaked hair was swept up in a careless ponytail, there was no disguising that she was somebody famous. It had always amazed Emily how Samantha could wear faded jeans and a T-shirt and wind up looking like a cover model. She just had that celebrity look about her, even if her acting career had never taken off quite the way she'd envisioned.<br><br>"Where's Gabi?" Emily asked, glancing around.<br><br>"Three guesses."<br><br>"Gram insisted on going home," Emily said readily.<br><br>"Got it in one," Samantha confirmed. "The minute they allowed residents back out there, Gram packed her bag. Gabi stalled her for a day, then told her if she was going to be stubborn as an old mule, at least she wasn't going alone. They left this morning at dawn, so I stuck around to be your designated driver."<br><br>"Do you actually remember how to drive?" Emily inquired skeptically. "You've been living in New York a long time."<br><br>Samantha merely lifted a brow, which told Emily what her sister thought about her sense of humor. That was the thing about having an actress in the family. Samantha could convey more with a look than most people could with an entire diatribe. Emily had been on the receiving end of a lot of those looks over the years.<br><br>"Do not start with me," Samantha warned. "I made it here, didn't I?"<br><br>Emily nodded toward the waiting car. "Is that the same car you drove from New York? Or did you have to trade in a wreck?"<br><br>"You are not amusing," Samantha retorted. She glanced at the compact carry-on Emily had brought. "That's it? That's all your luggage?"<br><br>Emily shrugged. "I'm used to traveling light. I was in Aspen on a job when I heard about the storm. I didn't have time to go back to Los Angeles to pick up more things."<br><br>"Anything in there suitable for mopping and scrubbing?" Samantha asked doubtfully. "I just don't see you mucking out the family restaurant in your designer heels. Those are Louboutins, right? You always did have expensive taste."<br><br></p><h2>Leaving Richard&#39;s Valley</h2><p><p><b>When a group of outcasts have to leave the valley, how will they survive the toxicity of the big city?</b></p><p>Richard is a benevolent but tough leader. He oversees everything that happens in the valley, and everyone loves him for it. When Lyle the Raccoon becomes sick, his friends&#x2015;Omar the Spider, Neville the Dog, and Ellie Squirrel&#x2015;take matters into their own hands, breaking Richard&#x2019;s strict rules. Caroline Frog rats them out to Richard and they are immediately exiled from the only world they&#x2019;ve ever known. </p><p>Michael DeForge&#x2019;s <i>Leaving Richard&#x2019;s Valley</i> expands from a bizarre hero&#x2019;s quest into something more. As this ragtag group makes their way out of the valley, and then out of the park and into the big city, we see them coming to terms with different kinds of community: noise-rockers, gentrification protesters, squatters, and more. DeForge is idiosyncratically funny but also deeply insightful about community, cults of personality, and the condo-ization of cities. These eye-catching and sometimes absurd comics coalesce into a book that questions who our cities are for and how we make community in a capitalist society.</p></p><p><b>Michael DeForge</b> was born in 1987 and has written eight books including <i>Ant Colony</i>, <i>First Year Healthy</i>, <i>Big Kids</i>, and <i>Sticks Angelica</i>.

I heard so many people talking about this strip before I stumbled across it and I couldn't help but consume it.

I have so much love and sadness in my heart for these characters and their crumbling paradise.

Lyle, Ellie, Omar, Caroline, and Neville are such great characters. I instantly liked everybody, even stupid Jesus Richard. The way this comic looks is truly unique, every page is so beautiful. P.S.

Especially ones like this that are so full of vivid picture that bring Biblical history to life for me. I loved that this pictorial atlas went further than simply exploring the world of the Old Testament and that of the New Testament, but also looked at the ancient world, the people, the vents, and anything else that it could examine that covered those silent years between the two testaments.

This new annotated edition, with an introduction by Alice Notley, includes seven previously uncollected works. Like Shakespeare's sonnets, Berrigan's poems involve friendship and love triangles, but while the former happen chronologically, Berrigan's happen in the moment, with the story buried beneath a surface of names, repetitions, and fragmented experience. Reflecting the new American sensibilities of the 1960's as well as timeless poetic themes, <b>The Sonnets</b> is both eclectic and classical &#x2014; the poems are monumental riddles worth contemplating.</p><p><b>Ted Berrigan</b>, poetic and inspiratinal genius of the second generation of the New York School Poets, was born in Providence, Rhode Isalnd, on November 15, 1934. He was educated at La Salle Academy in Providence and, after sixteen months in Korea as a soldier, at the University of Tulsa (on the GI Bill). During the 1960's he lived in New York's Lower East Side, writing city poems, publishing the exciting and unique "C" Magazine and "C" Press books, writing art criticism, and playing leader to a group of young poets and appreciators of poetry. Later he was Writer In Residence, Lecturer, Teaching Fellow, etc. at such places as The Writers Workshop (University of Iowa), the University of Essex (England), Northeastern Illinois University (Chicago), and the Naropa Institute. In the mid-1970s he returned to the Lower East Side, teaching at Stevens Institute of Technology and the City College of New York, giving poetry readings everywhere, and influencing a new generation of poets. His many books include the major sequence <b>The Sonnets</b>, a central collection <b>So Going Around Cities</b>, several collaborative books with other poets, long poems, a novel, and interviews. In a curriculum vitae from 1982, he described himself as "modestly venerable, large, traditional in appearance. Resemble Apollinaire (w/beard) or bear disguised as GBS ... Formidable, affable, durable �" He died on July 4, 1983.<br><b>Alice Notley</b> is a poet whose twenty previous titles include <b>The Descent of Alette, Beginning with a Stain, Homer's Art</b>, and <b>Selected Poems</b>. She wrote the introduction for her late first husband Ted Berrigan's <b>Selected Poems</b>. She lives in Paris.The sonnet, in Berrigan's hands (and scissors), was as much an arbitrary frame for experience as a traditional form. In her introduction and notes to this fifth and definitive printing of her late first husband's 1963 collage masterpiece, poet Alice Notley makes a persuasive case for the philosophical and art-historical grounding of these poems. On now greatly facilitated rereading, however, they remain first and foremost wonderful poetry. Berrigan's "sonnets" (conventional almost exclusively in their line count) were put together using a plethora of now-famous techniques: frame-breaking jump cuts, lines and phrases transposed from poem to poem and line to line, sound-based translations from French (and English), and simply beautiful writing. These methods, some lifted from John Ashbery's The Tennis Court Oath, are put in the service of plotlines both poignant and surly, and details hilarious and sensuous: "I think I was thinking when I was/ ahead I'd be somewhere like Perry street erudite/ dazzling slim and badly loved/ contemplating my new book of poems/ to be printed in simple type on old brown paper/ feminine marvelous and tough." The sonnet's customary pithy closing couplet is here converted into the detached, calm endings of modern poems and short stories. And the volta, or the rhetorical turn that characterizes Shakespeare's sonnets, isn't fixed at the beginning of the ninth line, as befits a poetry influenced (as Notley notes) by Whitehead's theory of time. This edition includes seven previously uncollected sonnets; these, with Notley's commentary, make this an indispensable addition to any poetry library. One hopes it will alert publishers to the need for a Collected Berrigan, and introduce new readers to a midcentury classic. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Soup: A Way of Life</h2><p>"Dora, my maternal grandmother," writes Barbara Kafka in her new book, "started the soup tradition that means most to me, which is odd as she was, by all accounts, a bad cook....I hope I am a better cook, and my life has certainly been easier, but I learned from her that a pot of soup is warmth and welcome for family and friends alike."<p> In this stunningly rich and wide-ranging book, Barbara Kafka gives the food we love perhaps best in the world a new vitality. Though the subject is so familiar to us all, her approach is totally original, just as it was in her award-winning <i>Roasting: A Simple Art</i> and <i>Microwave Gourmet</i>. In a wonderfully diverse collection of nearly three hundred recipes from all over the world--some traditional, some newly minted, many so simple they require no cooking at all, each of them very much a part of our spiritual and emotional lives--she offers up a lifetime worth of pleasure:</p><p></p><li>icy soups for steamy days (ceviche soup with ginger) and hot soups for cold days (winter duck soup)<p></p></li><li>rustic potages (great green soup) and elegant consommes (beef madrilene)<p></p></li><li>simple soups to start (Moroccan tomato) and complex soups that make a meal (beef short ribs in a pot)<p></p></li><li>fifteen-minute specials (mussels and tomato soup) and those that simmer all day (pot-au-feu)<p></p></li><li>a magical garlic broth, among other vegetable broths and bases, gives vegetarians hundreds of recipes to enjoy<p> As always, Barbara's intelligence and talent for innovation have resulted in a vast body of ideas to make your life in the kitchen easy and interesting. Nearly thirty stocks are offered, as well as dozens of ways to use seasonal produce to cook and freeze soup bases for year-round fresh taste. You'll find cooking times for everything from dumplings and piroshki to noodles and pasta, simmering times for every possible cut of meat, and yields and blanching times for dozens of vegetables. There are easy-to-follow charts to answer every cooking question.</p><p> And then there's Barbara's "memory pieces." Woven through the recipes, they form a book within a book, one family's personal and culinary history. They're fascinating and warming and enriching on their own. They also remind us why soup is a vital part of our lives. And why Barbara Kafka is a vital part of our cooking experience.</p></li><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><p>Barbara Kafka, author of such important and popular books as <i>Roasting: A Simple Art</i>, <i>Party Food</i>, and <i>Microwave Gourmet</i>, doesn't just speak with the voice of authority when she addresses anything that might have to do with food, she speaks with the voice of the woman who invented fire. It's right there, that voice, deep in her soul. And it calls out loud and clear in page after page of what has to be one of her best books ever. <p> <i>Soup</i> is the blood in Barbara Kafka's veins. "When I am tired and want comfort," she writes, "or when I want to share happiness, or just when I want something full of flavor, my first desire is soup." It is through soup that Kafka embraces the generations of her family, her husband's family, the families of her children's spouses. It is through soup that Kafka embraces the world. "Every culture has its soups and the soups may be said to represent them."</p><p> The book begins with a brief overview of technique ("How to Boil Water"), then drops right into a section she calls "Family Soups." Here are the soups Kafka identifies with her grandmother and mother (Chicken Soup and Split-Pea Soup, respectively), her husband (Winter Duck Soup), her own youth (Gazpacho), her adult nature (Veal Soup with Fennel), as well as soups linked to other members of her family. It's as personal as looking through the Kafka family photo album with the author at your side.</p><p> From that base, Ms. Kafka moves on to the world of soups, be they of a vegetable nature, or those that rely on various birds or meats or seafoods. She winds down with stocks, noodles, dumplings, sauces, and the like. </p><p> It's a masterful production: simple, clear, uncluttered, direct, and thorough. It's a book that opens the senses to the world much as the steam rising off a bowl of lovingly made soup. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p><i>Few cookbook authors have done more to define how Americans eat than Barbara Kafka, whose award-winning</i> Microwave Gourmet <i>and</i> Roasting <i>revolutionized everyday cooking.</i><p> With her encyclopedic knowledge and original approach, Kafka promises to do the same in <i>Soup, a Way of Life.</i> She takes this most satisfying of foods that epitomizes comfort world-round and shows us how to put it squarely on our table--simply, gloriously, soothingly, and often. She proves what a good friend good soup can be--it's not temperamental; it's forgiving; it knows no class or ethnic bounds. It restores; it refreshes; it celebrates. In nearly three hundred recipes--some so simple they require no cooking at all--Kafka offers up cold soups for hot days, hot soups for cold days, simple soups to start a meal and bountiful soups that make a meal.</p><p> And most of all, there's Barbara Kafka, writing in her own inimitable way of food memories that are as enriching as the soups themselves.</p></p><h2>Istanbul: The Imperial City</h2><p>Istanbul&#39;s history is a catalogue of change, not least of name, yet it has managed to retain its own unique identity.

Long that examines the lives of woodland creatures such as mouse, otter, kingfisher, red squirrel, partridge, deer, and many others. We would not feel comfortable if a big barbarian came into our quiet home, broke the door down, whacked his war-club on the furniture, and whooped his battle yell. We could hardly be natural under the circumstances. Our true dispositions would hide themselves. We might even vacate the house bodily. Just so Wood Folk.

Bringing to her subjects an acute sense of the many meanings of the marginal, she examines topics such as Asian and African texts, the theories of Barthes, questions of spectatorship, the enigmas of art, and the perils of anthropology.<br> <br> <strong></strong><strong><em>When the Moon Waxes Red</em></strong> is an extended argument against reductive analyses, even those that appear politically adroit. The multiply-hyphenated peoples of color are not simply placed in a duality between two cultural heritages; throughout, Trinh describes the predicament of having to live "a difference that has no name and too many names already." She argues for multicultural revision of knowledge so that a new politics can transform reality rather than merely ideologize it. By rewriting the always emerging, already distorted place of struggle, such work seeks to "beat the master at his own game."</p><p><strong>Trinh Minh-ha</strong> is Chancellors' Distinguished Professor in Women's Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and Associate Professor of Cinema at San Francisco State University. Among her films is <em>Surname</em> <em>Viet Given Name Nam</em>. She is the author of <em>Women, Native,</em> <em>Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism</em> and, most recently, has coedited <em>Out There: Marginalization in</em> <em>Contemporary Culture</em>.In this collection of 14 essays, Trinh, a writer, feminist, and filmmaker, explores unconventional documentary filmmaking and literary techniques. Typically, documentary styles have kept a distance between subject and viewer, creating a sense of mastery in the viewer. By stressing form rather than content, boundaries of the acceptable in artform are transgressed, resulting in a nonlinear movement that leads the viewer into a profound experience that does not have to make sense. In this well-documented book, Trinh explores semiotic ideas of Michel Foucault and Roland Barthes, along with the works of Zora Neale Hurston and Helene Cixous, among others. Illustrated with footage from her films, the form of Trinh's book plays a major role in the presentation of its content. A wonderful volume, this is recommended for academic libraries, especially those that support programs in film and women's studies.<br><i>- Paula N. Arnold, Norwich Univ.

In 1937, Celia Jane Allen traveled to Jim Crow Mississippi to organize rural black workers around black nationalist causes. In the late 1940s, from her home in Kingston, Jamaica, Amy Jacques Garvey launched an extensive letter-writing campaign to defend the Greater Liberia Bill, which would relocate 13 million black Americans to West Africa.</p> <p>Gordon, Allen, and Jacques Garvey&#x2014;as well as Maymie De Mena, Ethel Collins, Amy Ashwood, and Ethel Waddell&#x2014;are part of an overlooked and understudied group of black women who take center stage in <em>Set the World on Fire</em>, the first book to examine how black nationalist women engaged in national and global politics from the early twentieth century to the 1960s. Historians of the era generally portray the period between the Garvey movement of the 1920s and the Black Power movement of the 1960s as one of declining black nationalist activism, but Keisha N. Blain reframes the Great Depression, World War II, and the early Cold War as significant eras of black nationalist&#x2014;and particularly, black nationalist women's&#x2014;ferment.</p> <p>In Chicago, Harlem, and the Mississippi Delta, from Britain to Jamaica, these women built alliances with people of color around the globe, agitating for the rights and liberation of black people in the United States and across the African diaspora. As pragmatic activists, they employed multiple protest strategies and tactics, combined numerous religious and political ideologies, and forged unlikely alliances in their struggles for freedom. Drawing on a variety of previously untapped sources, including newspapers, government records, songs, and poetry, <em>Set the World on Fire</em> highlights the flexibility, adaptability, and experimentation of black women leaders who demanded equal recognition and participation in global civil society.</p></p><p>I faced many challenges writing this book. One of the most difficult ones to overcome was the issue of primary sources. I knew that I wanted to tell the story of how black nationalist women engaged in national and global politics in the three decades after&nbsp;Marcus Garvey&nbsp;was deported from the United States, but I wasn't quite sure how that would be possible. At the very beginning of the research process, I sent out several inquiries to archivists and librarians asking if they were aware of any collections I might be able to explore. Their responses revealed to me that I had a major task ahead. With few exceptions (such as the Amy Jacques Garvey papers at Fisk), it was rare to find collections of&nbsp;black nationalist women&nbsp;during the period in which I was studying. That meant that I needed to build an&nbsp;archive&nbsp;and then analyze the materials in order to tell the story all at once.<br>&nbsp;<br>The process of building that archive was physically and even emotionally taxing. In so many instances, I was only able to figure out specific details of these women's lives or details about a specific incident until I had completed a dozen or so research trips. As I collected materials and organized them chronologically and thematically, I was eventually able to piece together the story and even then, I would find gaps of information, which would force me to embark on even more research trips.<br>&nbsp;<br>In one case, I spent 3 months combing through census records in order to find information about Celia Jane Allen--one of the women I discuss in the book. She worked very hard to stay under the radar (so much so that I later found correspondence with FBI officials who admitted having a hard time locating her) and I could not find much about her early life. After obsessing about this for months, I eventually sat down and decided to simply write about what I&nbsp;<i>did</i>&nbsp;know with the materials I had in my possession--a few of her letters and poems and some second-hand accounts. In the process of writing, I began to discover new clues and with time, I was able to construct a rich narrative about her life while being honest with readers about what I knew and simply did not know. Despite the challenges that I faced, I was encouraged by so many amazing scholars and activists who cheered me on to the finish line and reminded me of the significance of the book at those moments when I grew discouraged. I am glad I didn't "throw in the towel."<b>"<i>Set the World on Fire</i>&nbsp;is history at its very best. Keisha Blain has given us an unobstructed window into the minds of black nationalist women.

He offers compelling portraits of Saladin, the wise and highly cultured leader who created a united empire, and Richard the Lionheart, the romantic personification of chivalry who emerges here in his full complexity and contradictions. From its riveting scenes of blood-soaked battles to its pageant of fascinating, larger-than-life characters, <b>Warriors of God</b><i> </i>is essential history, history that helps us understand today's world.</p><p>Throughout the medieval era, the Holy Land was a fiercely contested battlefield, fought over by huge Muslim and Christian armies, by zealots and assassins. The Third Crusade, spanning five years at the end of the 12th century, was, writes James Reston Jr. in this absorbing account, "Holy War at its most virulent," overseen by two great leaders, the Kurdish sultan Salah ad-Din, or Saladin, and the English king Richard, forevermore known as Lionheart.<p> Writing with a keen sense of historical detail and drama, Reston traces the complex path by which Saladin and Richard came to face each other on the field of battle. The Crusades, he observes, began "as a measure to redirect the energies of warring European barons from their bloody, local disputes into a 'noble' quest to reclaim the Holy Land from the 'infidel'." Of the five Crusades over 200 years, only the first was successful, to the extent that the Christian armies were able to conquer their objective of Jerusalem. The Third Crusade, as Reston ably shows, was complicated by fierce rivalries among the Christian leaders, by a chain of military disasters that led to the destruction of an invading German army and its emperor, and by the dedication of an opposing Islamic army that shared both a goal and a language.</p><p> Saladin, Reston writes, was a brilliant leader and a merciful victor, but capable of costly errors; Richard was extraordinarily skilled at combat, but his lack of resolve cost him many battles, and, ultimately, Jerusalem. Richard returned to Europe, Saladin to Damascus. Neither leader has long to live, and the peace they made would soon be broken. James Reston's splendid book does them both honor while examining a conflict that has never really ended. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Warriors of God" is the rich and engaging account of the Third Crusade (1187-1192), a conflict that would shape world history for centuries and which can still be felt in the Middle East and throughout the world today.

Deborah Tannen, author of <i>You Just Don't Understand</i> and <i>That's Not What I Meant!</i>, is an expert on miscommunication. In <i>The Argument Culture</i> she posits that misunderstanding is endemic in our culture because we tend to believe that the best way to a common goal is by thrashing out all our differences as loudly as possible along the way. Thus we are treated to a whole array of confrontational public forums, from congressional partisan politics to media circuses � la Jerry Springer and Jenny Jones, all based on a metaphor of war. What gets lost in all the shouting, Tannen says, is thoughtful debate and real understanding. Perhaps it's time to consider other methods of communication, she suggests. In addition to outlining what she considers the worst excesses of our argument culture, Tannen revisits some of the territory covered in <i>You Just Don't Understand</i> as she discusses the different ways in which young boys and girls express disagreement or aggression. Finally, she offers a survey of other, mostly non-Western ways of dealing with conflict, including the use of intermediaries and rituals.

But only one of them was there to commit murder.<br><br>It was the third week in August, the height of the summer. The schools were closed, and whole families had taken advantage of the fine weather to arrive at the old air base, less than a mile from the sea. They had strolled around vintage planes from the first and second world wars: single-seat biplanes parked next to Spitfires and Hurricanes. That morning, the Red Arrows had put on a dazzling display, twisting and crisscrossing each other in the sky before swooping down, trailing plumes of red, white, and blue. There had been fly-pasts by the Tornado GR4, the two-seat attack aircraft that had been used in Iraq and Libya, and by the Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, one of the most sophisticated and&#x2014;at $125 million&#x2014;one of the most expensive aircrafts in the world. The grounds were packed with simulator rides, motorbike displays, drones, face-painting and fairground stalls. Everyone was having a good time.<br><br>As with every public event in the UK, an extensive, almost invisible security net had been put in place. It was impossible to stop and search all the cars, but CCTV cameras recorded every arrival and every license plate was instantly checked. People might notice police and even a few sniffer dogs moving among them. These were a common sight. But they would have been unaware of the plainclothes policemen, many of them with concealed weapons, mingling with the crowd. In fact the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC) had met in their offices close to the Houses of Parliament just a few days before and had agreed that the threat level at the Suffolk Air Show would remain at moderate. They weren&#x2019;t expecting any trouble.<br><br>And so nobody had paid very much attention to the woman who had arrived just after three o&#x2019;clock. She had driven into the parking lot in a Ford Transit van that, according to the Automatic Number Plate Recognition system, belonged to the St John Ambulance service. This was the country&#x2019;s leading first aid charity, and indeed, the woman was dressed in the green and black uniform of a local volunteer. She was carrying a nylon bag marked with a white cross that, if opened, would reveal medicine and bandages.<br><br>She was short and round-shouldered with dark red hair that had been cut very badly so that it stuck out straight on one side of her skull and curled on the other. There was something quite aggressive about the way she walked, like a boxer about to enter the ring. She was overweight, breathing heavily with beads of sweat on her upper lip. As she walked, she slipped on a pair of cheap sunglasses. They concealed the smoldering violence in her eyes.<br><br>There was a separate entrance leading into the air base, reserved for paramedics, technicians, organizers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. anyone working the event. She stopped and showed a pass that identified her as Jane Smith, but this was not her real name, nor had she ever worked for the St John Ambulance service. The security man at the gate might have wondered why she had arrived so late in the day, when the event was almost over. He might have asked her why she was alone. But he was tired and he was looking forward to getting home. He glanced at her pass and waved her through. He didn&#x2019;t even look inside the bag.<br><br>The woman&#x2019;s real name was Dragana Novak. She was forty-six years old, and until recently she had been a lieutenant colonel in the Serbian air force; a highflier in every sense of the word. Her career had ended following a drunken fight with another pilot. He had been twice her size, but even so, she had put him into the hospital. In fact he was still there. Inevitably, there had been a court-martial, and she had been looking forward to an uncertain future&#x2014;perhaps even a return to the turnip farm where she had been brought up. That was when she had received the telephone call. There was a unique job opportunity. It would pay two hundred thousand dollars a day for two days&#x2019; work. Was she interested?<br><br>Dragana didn&#x2019;t need to think for a minute. She had met her contact in a local tavern in Belgrade, where she had tucked into her favorite dish of sarma&#x2014;spicy beef wrapped in cabbage leaves&#x2014;washed down with a large glass of rakija&#x2014;the local plum brandy. The man, who had never given her his name, had told her what was needed. It was a tricky operation that would demand all her skills. Dragana hadn&#x2019;t asked any questions. All she cared about was the money. It was more than she had been paid in her life.<br><br>She was still dreaming about jewelry, fast cars, and expensive chocolates as she made her way past the various exhibition stands, the bars, the fast-food outlets. People were already drifting toward the seats for the last flying display of the afternoon. For many of them it was the high point of the entire show. The aircraft was sitting out on the tarmac, patiently waiting for the pilot to walk over and take the controls. Dragana stopped at the barrier that ran the full length of the runway and took out a pair of binoculars. Without removing her dark glasses, she raised them to her eyes. Slowly, unable to help herself, she smiled.<br><br>This was what she had come to steal.<br><br>The American-built Sikorsky CH-53E is also known as the Super Stallion, and there&#x2019;s really no helicopter in the world that&#x2019;s quite like it. Looking at it, it&#x2019;s hard to believe that it can fly at all. For a start, it&#x2019;s huge: as tall as a three-story building and longer than three London buses parked end to end. It&#x2019;s also surprisingly ugly, bolted together as if the designers had never actually had any plans.<br><br>The Super Stallion can fly&#x2014;at two hundred miles per hour&#x2014;and what makes it special is that it can carry an enormous load. It is the workhorse for the United States military, capable of lifting sixteen tons of cargo. When the Americans mount an assault, it can transport a platoon with enough weapons to obliterate an entire army. How does it even get off the ground? Part of the answer is that it has no fewer than three hugely powerful turboshaft engines. It also has enormous titanium-fiberglass rotor blades, seventy-nine feet in diameter. Most helicopters have just four blades. The Super Stallion has seven.<br><br>Dragana Novak examined the Super Stallion, running her eyes over the gray-painted fuselage, the cockpit, the tail rotor. The Serbian air force couldn&#x2019;t possibly afford a machine like this, but Dragana had briefly flown one when she was on a training exercise with the United Nations and still remembered the thrill it had given her. In less than thirty minutes&#x2019; time, it would be hers. She had no children. She had never married. But right now, looking at the helicopter, she felt its power reaching out to her and knew that she was completely in love.<br><br>It was time to move. Everything had been planned down to the last second, and she had been shown exactly where she had to go. There were several hangars on the other side of the runway, but two buildings dominated the airfield closer by, both of them left over from the last war. One was the control tower. The other was a low redbrick building with about twenty evenly spaced windows and several doors. This had been an office complex, but it was being used to house the pilots and technicians during the show with changing rooms, rest areas, and a cafeteria at the far end.<br><br>Hoisting her medicine bag over her shoulder, Dragana strolled toward the entrance where two more uniformed officials were standing behind a conveyor belt that fed into an X-ray machine, exactly the same sort of device that could be found at any airport. First, visitors would have their cases and shopping bags scanned. Then there was a metal detector that everyone had to pass through.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to see Sergeant Perkins.&#x201d; She had spent five years studying in London before qualifying as a pilot and spoke good English but with a heavy accent that made her seem as if she disliked everything she was saying.<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; The officials glanced at one another, puzzled. They had been here all day, and this was the first time they had seen her.<br><br>Dragana smiled, showing gray teeth, discolored by wine and cigarettes. Her right hand slipped into the pocket of her jacket. &#x201c;He has a headache. I have some aspirin for him.&#x201d;<br><br>Of course the story was ridiculous. The two men should have rung the control tower to get confirmation. But just like the guard at the main gate, they came to all the wrong conclusions. This was a single woman. She was wearing a St John Ambulance uniform. It was the end of the day, almost the end of the entire event. What possible harm could there be? &#x201c;All right,&#x201d; one of them said. &#x201c;Your bag has to go through the machine, and remove any metal objects from your pockets.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; Dragana placed the medicine bag on the belt and watched as it was carried slowly into the machine. She knew that there was nothing inside to cause any alarm. Next, she stepped through the metal detector and smiled to herself as the light flashed green. She collected her things and continued on her way. This was going to be even easier than she had thought.<br><br>She continued down a long corridor with a wooden floor and old-fashioned hanging lights. A few people passed her but didn&#x2019;t give her a second glance. Again, the uniform saw to that. She came to a door at the end and knocked politely.<br><br>&#x201c;Come in!&#x201d; Even in just two words, she could detect the American accent.<br><br>There were two men sitting in the room, both wearing flight suits. First Sergeant Brad Perkins was in his early thirties but looked much younger: clean-shaven, fair-haired, with blue eyes. He had recently graduated as a pilot from the US Army Aviation Center at Fort Rucker in Alabama, and this was one of his first deployments. He was a little annoyed to find himself not just in England but in some place he&#x2019;d never heard of. Suffolk? Where the heck was that? There was a copilot sitting with him, also American, about the same age, drinking Coke. Dragana didn&#x2019;t know his name. Nor did she care.<br><br>&#x201c;How can we help you?&#x201d; Perkins asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, actually, you can die.&#x201d; Dragana had taken an unusual-looking gun out of her jacket pocket. It was white and made of ceramic, which was why it had passed unnoticed through the metal detector. She squeezed the trigger twice. The gun used a small chamber of compressed air to fire not bullets but plastic needles, each one tipped with tetrodotoxin, one of the deadliest poisons on the planet. Tetrodotoxin, or TTX as it&#x2019;s known, is a neurotoxin found in certain fish and octopuses and is extremely fast-acting. Brad struggled to his feet but died before he was halfway there. His partner tried to say something, stared, then collapsed.<br><br>Dragana put the gun away and went over to the two men. Sergeant Brad Perkins stared up at her with empty eyes. He was the smaller of the two, about her size. She reached down and unbuttoned his uniform.<br><br>Ten minutes later, she walked out of the building, now dressed in a flight suit and carrying a leather folder. Nobody stopped her as she reached the Super Stallion and climbed inside. The ground staff had been expecting two men, not a single woman. And she was twenty minutes early. But still nobody challenged her. After all, she looked as if she knew what she was doing. She was dressed for the part. And the very idea that somebody might be about to steal a gigantic helicopter in broad daylight was so bizarre, so outrageous, that nobody even considered it.<br><br>And so she was completely relaxed as she slipped on a set of headphones and strapped herself in. Out of habit, she ran her eye over the various gauges, checking the fuel levels. She flicked on the master battery, the avionics, and the fuel valve master, then watched as the seven huge blades began to turn, picking up speed until they were no more than a blur. Even with the headphones, she was deafened by the engines. She rested her left hand on the collective control, then leaned over and adjusted the throttle. She could feel the downdraft underneath her, beating onto the tarmac at ninety miles per hour.<br><br><i>Stallion One. You are clear for takeoff&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i><br><br>The voice came from the control tower, a young man, very English, stupidly cheerful.<br><br>A final check. She had reached proper operating RPM (revs per minute). Using the throttle and the foot pedals, she steered the Super Stallion along the runway, gently guiding it. This was the moment she loved, when this huge machine belonged only to her. She found herself whispering to it in her own language, urging it to obey her commands as it tilted forward then rose, impossibly, into the air.<br><br>As they left the ground, she thought briefly of the two men she had killed. She had no pity for them. After all, she was a military officer who had been trained to kill people&#x2014;although she had been disappointed that she had never had the opportunity until today. Ten minutes in the air and two hundred thousand dollars in the bank. She would have killed fifty more people for that. She reached out and pressed on the cyclic lever, bringing the nose of the helicopter down and urging it forward. Obeying her commands, the Super Stallion shot out beyond the coastline and over the sea.<br><br><i>Stallion One. Turn left heading zero five zero and ascend flight level one hundred, over.</i><br><br>The man in the control tower was still jabbering in her ear. Of course she wasn&#x2019;t going to do what he said. In fact, he was beginning to annoy her. She reached down and turned the volume off. Then she turned right.<br><br>They would know almost at once that something was wrong. The path of the helicopter would be traced by primary and secondary radar systems. Very soon, there would be a red alert at the National Air Traffic Service center at Swanwick. It might have happened already. They would know that she had strayed from the agreed flight path and was not responding to their commands. They would already be tracking her. There were dozens of satellites in outer space, and they would be directed to watch her every move. And of course, the Super Stallion was filled with communications equipment that she had been unable to neutralize and that would be transmitting even now. She loved the helicopter. It belonged to her. But she couldn&#x2019;t stop it from giving the two of them away.<br><br>Timing was everything. She had memorized the exact route she had to take and made the necessary adjustments. The gray surface of the North Sea was beneath her, but now she brought the helicopter around, traveling south. Looking out of the window, she saw the port of Felixstowe, the lines of cranes and gantries lined up along the docks, the two rivers&#x2014;the Stour and the Orwell&#x2014;stretching inland. She checked her course and accelerated, sweeping low over the pier and the seafront. She knew she would be seen, but that didn&#x2019;t matter. In a way, it would help.<br><br>The field she was looking for was just south of the A12, the road that led from Suffolk to London. There was a scattering of buildings, an abandoned farm. She had already been shown the maps and photographs and had studied them so many times that she recognized them instantly. She noticed a few cars parked around the ...</p><h2>The Bridge of Sighs: A Novel (Yalta Boulevard Quintet, 1)</h2><p><p>In this auspicious literary crime debut from <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>The Tourist</i>, an inexperienced homicide detective struggles amid the lawlessness of a post-WWII Eastern European city.</p><p>It's August, 1948, three years after the Russians "liberated" this small nation from German Occupation.

He would like to investigate further, but even in his naivete, he realizes that the police academy never prepared him for this peculiar post-war environment, in which his colleagues are suspicious or silent, where lawlessness and corruption are the rules of the city, and in which he's still expected to investigate a murder.

Visit OlenSteinhauer.com.THE BRIDGE OF SIGHS (Chapter One)<p>The greeting was in his desk, the center drawer: a piece of fish-stained cardboard with a clumsily drawn stick figure. It had a circular head and an X for each eye. A fat knife separated the head from its stick body. The speech balloon said, We're on to you.</p><p>His chair wobbled insecurely beneath him.</p><p>Emil inhaled slowly, evenly. He sat in the center of the large, stale-smelling office, between two columns, and on the far wall two high, open windows did nothing to freshen the air. His tight suit constricted him as he stared above the others' heads at the clock on the yellow wall. It was the dirty, pale yellow of Austro-Hungarian demise. He had been here only forty-five minutes.</p><p>It was Monday, the twenty-third of August, 1948, 9:17 A.M. He still had a whole day to go.</p><p>He couldn't match names to their faces yet, but why should that matter? Along the walls, three of the four homicide inspectors grinned at their wide, steel desks, suppressing laughter. They were all to blame. Through the windows, street noises spilled into the hot room: clopping hooves, shouts, the occasional motor car.</p><p>His grandmother had starched his suit into a hard crust to celebrate his first day in the People's Militia. He wanted to run his finger between his collar and neck, but knew how it would look.</p><p>His exhale finally came.</p><p>The fourth inspector wasn't grinning: the stout one at the corner desk with the wide, flat, familiar-looking peasant's face. Despite the heat wave, he lounged in the leather overcoat of state security. By law, one security inspector was assigned to each Militia department, but no law ordered them to dress like that, like the Russian secret police. Yet they all did. And like their MVD counterparts, they never laughed. This one stared at Emil with the intensity of a scientist waiting for a nerve-provoked response.</p><p>In the opposite corner, beside the windows, the largest of them banged slowly at a typewriter. He was a neckless lump of clay with tin rings constricting his thick fingers. The sound of striking keys filled the room.</p><p>Emil had spoken to them once when he arrived. A twenty-two-year-old in a stiff suit with a stupid, bashful grin marking his pale features, a blond schoolboy among these dark veterans. "My name is Emil Brod, and this is my first day with Homicide."</p><p>A voice he could not put to a face had answered: "Desk's in the center."</p><p>Even then, they did not show him their eyes. But he was the only thing they were watching.</p><p>Emil settled his small hands on the desk.</p><p>At another time and place the sketched decapitation would have provoked violence. But now, here, he separated himself from the anger. He let the cardboard drop into his wastebasket, gingerly shifted the chair beneath himself, and opened the morning's Spark, which he had picked up on his way to work. There were grainy images of airplanes in the west, heavy American and British planes over Berlin. Words about remilitarization and effrontery spotted the pages, but he couldn't focus enough to read whole sentences. The typewriter continued snapping. The stuffy room grew hotter.</p><p>He had gone dutifully to the desk in the center of the room, just as the voice had commanded, and put down his hat and satchel. Then he rapped timidly on the door with CHIEF painted on the wood. A light curtain covered the dark window beside it. "When does Chief Moska arrive?"</p><p>It was an insignificant question, something he almost felt foolish asking, and their agreement was apparent by their silence. He returned to his desk. When he sat down his chair collapsed beneath him.</p><p>They had all laughed then, even the security inspector.</p><p>He sprang up. The chair was in pieces. The rope that bound its legs together had snapped, or been cut. Their amused faces turned back to their desks as he tied the chair together again with a fishing knot. It wobbled, but held. By the time he was finished, the laughter had been over a long time.</p><p>It was then that he had reached for the center drawer, if for no other reason than to look busy.</p><p>Maybe it was a joke. He didn't know. They had laughed, so perhaps there was nothing more to this than some gentle hazing. Like in the Academy, when they buried his papers in the middle of the firing range, or when he lay in the mud and they gave him one kick apiece. Certainly this was easier than that.</p><p>He set the newspaper aside. In one dusty corner was a brown porcelain heater for wintertime, as tall as a man, and along the walls three desks faced the center--faced him. The fourth desk, the state security inspector's, faced the wall.</p><p>He settled back into his creaking chair and affected a calm he didn't feel. He arranged the ink bottle on his desk and straightened the blotter, then placed his transfer papers--in triplicate, as required--along the edge. From his burlap satchel he brought out the cigars and the leather-bound notepad his grandfather had been able to unearth in the black market off Heroes' Square. If he focused on these little things he could make it.</p><p>The inspectors lounged at their desks, sweating, chewing dried pumpkin seeds, sometimes muttering into telephones, other times writing or smoking. The big one continued typing. Two of them--one scrawny and very dark, the other heavy and limping, spitting out flakes of pumpkin seed--met beside yellowed WANTED notices and joked quietly with one another. The sound of their laughter left small, cold spots in Emil's guts. They left the office together and returned smelling of clear alcohols. The fat one carried a fresh bag of tobacco with nicotine-yellowed fingers.</p><p>A man outside was shouting in Russian. Although the rowdy Russian soldiers that still occupied their small capital disturbed him as much as the next person, at that moment he wanted to be with them, under the sun, rather than in this dim, humid room with his own kind.</p><p>He stood without knowing why. Then, as he approached the massive typist, he knew. He would start with the largest, if only to instill faith in his courage. Emil rapped on the big man's desk beside an empty paper cup blackened by the morning's grounds. "Where do I get coffee around here?"</p><p>He stopped typing and looked at Emil's hand as though his finger were a cockroach. This close, the inspector's face was pocked and misshapen like a battlefield. "No coffee," he said flatly. He crushed the cup in his hand, then tossed it in his wastebasket.</p><p>Emil's collar tightened. He smiled involuntarily and stepped back to his desk. He could hear laughter somewhere. It was faint and distant beneath the hot buzzing of his blood. So was the glint of his polished shoes moving across the floor. He was a stiff clown among these wrinkled, dusty brutes. He remembered the Academy director's words: First District, Homicide. Desk's been open two years since some old poop named Sergei got himself shot after Liberation. They'll take anyone, Brod, why not you?</p><p>Why not, indeed.</p><p>The Spark was full of airplanes. It had been full of blockades and planes since June. Muddy newsprint airplanes on cheap, brittle pages, but they were clear enough. Allied airplanes over hills of rubble; airplanes over military convoys; airplanes over the hungry, defeated masses of a crushed Berlin, dropping parachutes with little boxes of food and chocolates and clothing. And--some reports said--guns.</p><p>The front page never changed, not even today. A part of him had expected to find the planes replaced by his own face--thin and pale, blond eyebrows almost invisible above his green eyes--beneath the headline: EMIL BROD MOVES INTO THE WORKING WORLD--NO MORE LESSONS FOR HIM! But there they still were, after weeks: airplanes: IMPERIAL UNDERHANDEDNESS IN BERLIN! Comrade Chairman Stalin called the institution of a new German currency a provocation. If the Allies had their way, a reborn, capitalist Germany would consume the workers of the world in fire. General Secretary Mihai, whose office was only a few streets away, reminded all citizens that their own country was small and young. It could easily be divided out of existence again by the republics around it. No one misunderstood his meaning. "Before the Great War, we were only a district of the Dual Monarchy--remember Versailles!" he told a reporter. "The others would claim we are theirs, but we are not pieces of the Ukraine and Czechoslovakia--we're neither Romania nor Hungary nor Poland! We are our own, indivisible nation!" Then: "Up with the Comrade Chairman!"</p><p>The second page listed upcoming trials. It was no longer like the days just after the Liberation, when the lists went on for many columns. But there were still some men and women accused of undermining the stability of their socialist state. There were a baker and three politicians and two tram drivers--which proved, according to a certain well-regarded Inspector Brano Sev, the democratic sensibility inherent in the instruments of criminal justice.</p><p>Around noon, he tried the smallest one. The wiry, dark inspector who sat beside the cold porcelain stove. He had a face that reminded Emil of the Jews who had appeared at the family dacha in Ruscova during the war. They had come in loose, hungry bands from over the Romanian border, muttering frantically about the Archangel Michael and their villages being burned to the ground. Their families, they said, had been chopped up by the Orthodox. This inspector had that same hungry, war-refugee look.</p><p>Emil spoke to him over the hand basins in the empty wash-room. His voice echoed unexpectedly against the tile walls. "How long does this go on?"</p><p>The inspector stopped splashing water over the back of his neck. He looked at Emil in the rusting mirror, hungry brow furrowing.</p><p>Beneath Emil's feet the decaying floor tiles wobbled. "The silence," he said, trying to make his voice sound light, conversational. "Is this what everyone goes through? I think I know how this works. Initiation?" He twisted his lips into a smile. "Or are you trying to scare me away?" He almost added jokingly that this situation hadn't come up in the Academy lessons, but thought better of it.</p><p>The inspector turned away, shook water off his hands and used a towel from a hook. His dark features gave away nothing, his eyes hard and small as he dried his neck. He gave Emil only a passing glance in the mirror as he hung up the towel again. Then he left. The creaking door echoed behind him.</p><p>They left the office singly and in pairs and did not return for hours. He assumed they were on cases. The Academy had taught two ways for a homicide inspector to receive a case. Either a switchboard operator sent a message to your telephone line, or the station chief emerged from his office and handed you one. All through the morning the phone on Emil's desk did not ring, and the chief was never in. He got coffee from a workers' caf� around the corner, returned, used the toilet twice, read the last pages of The Spark--all slowly, purposefully.</p><p>Around two o'clock, Chief Moska appeared in the doorway. He was another big man, in his fifties, who hiked up wrinkled, mud-spotted pants, rolled a cigarette in his lips, and took off his hat to mop damp, gray hair with a handkerchief. He stopped by desks and whispered to his men, and when they smiled Emil's stomach shriveled. These men were tight, had been for years. They had probably even fought the Germans together--side by side, without his help.</p><p>The chief stopped at Emil's desk and inclined his long, pale face. The smile was gone. He had the worn features of war veterans who believe they have witnessed everything this life could ever show them. "So you're the new one?" His voice was no longer a fraternal whisper; it was deep and swollen for all to hear.</p><p>"Yes, Comrade Chief Moska."</p><p>"Emil Brod from the Fourth District?"</p><p>"Fifth, Comrade Chief."</p><p>"Where did you serve in the Patriotic War?"</p><p>"I was too young, Com--"</p><p>"Too young my ass!" he bellowed. "You were born in 1926, which made you of age in--what?--1942, or at the latest '44." He eyeballed Emil's little hands on the desk. Emil removed them. "I have a neighbor who fought Germans when he was twelve. Remember who has your file, Brod."</p><p>Emil spoke with as much authority as he could muster. "What I meant to say was that when I came of age, I was not in the country. I was--"</p><p>"You were fishing in Finland!" the chief erupted, his sudden, broad smile revealing two holes where teeth should have been. "For little seals, no less!"</p><p>Their laughter was loud, bouncing off the walls.</p><p>"A Finnish company, yes," said Emil, recognizing a slight warble to his voice he hoped was only in his head. "But I hunted in the Arctic Circle."</p><p>For an instant he was out of this hot room and back in the icy north, among men so much more dangerous than these.</p><p>"You speak Russian, I hear."</p><p>"Yes. And German."</p><p>"A scholar," said the chief. "And now here you are, back at your mother's tit."</p><p>"In Homicide," Emil replied, his voice clearing up. "And I'm ready to work. Here are my transfer papers." He held out the folded pages.</p><p>The chief suddenly had the expression of a man about to retch. His nostrils, crisscrossed by a drinker's red tributaries, retracted. Then he stuffed the papers into his blazer pocket. "Well, Comrade Brod," he said through a heavy sigh, "don't make trouble. If you do that, trouble might stay away from you."</p><p>There were sprinkles of weak laughter from corners of the room Emil could not locate, because the blood pumping in his ears obscured their direction.</p><p>"I wouldn't consider it, Comrade Chief."</p><p>"And don't comrade me to death, Brod. Makes my skin crawl. Can you manage that simple task?"</p><p>"Yes, Chief."</p><p>They were all watching the exchange, their smiles fading in and out until the chief gave him one last miserable look, turned on his heel, and walked into his office. The door latched quietly.</p><p>Emil caught their amused faces as they turned away--the big typist, the refugee, the pumpkin-seed eater sweating in the back and the state security inspector with the peasant's features that clicked in Emil's skull, nagging at a memory that would not come.</p><p>First was the chair. Second, the drawing. Third was the homicide inspector with the face of a refugee who met him on the hot front steps at the end of that fruitless day. Down by the busy street, he smoked with some regular policemen standing in a semicircle around the head of a fly-nagged horse. Red-faced vendors sold wooden spoons and fabrics on the sidewalk, and a butcher hauled a bleating goose into his store. The policemen watched a pair of young women walk by, and hissed admiringly. When the embarrassed girls were no longer in sight, the inspector noticed Emil standing at the top of the steps. He patted the horse's nose, nodded at his friends, and began climbing toward him. The air was perfectly still.</p><p>Briefly, Emil felt a surge of the unreasonable hope that had buoyed him most of his life. It had brought him through the deaths of both his parents in the war and his months scraping out a living on the fishing boats of the frozen north. It had brought him through a brief love affair back here in the Capital, and the brutalities of the Academy. It had carried him all the way to these steps, where the concrete was remarkably bright after the gloom of the station. He sucked hot, wet air into his lungs, and blinked.</p><p>"Brod."</p><p>"Yes," said Emil, feeling the warmth of that hereditary hope. "Terzian, isn't it? Your name? Leonek Terzian?"</p><p>Leonek Terzian was two steps down, squinting up at him. "I wanted to tell you something," he said, his voice lacking anything Emil could call emotion.</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>Terzian glance...</p></p><h2>Seneca: Epistles 66-92 (Loeb No. 76)</h2><p><p>Seneca, Lucius Annaeus, born at Corduba (Cordova) ca. 4 BCE, of a prominent and wealthy family, spent an ailing childhood and youth at Rome in an aunt's care. He became famous in rhetoric, philosophy, money-making, and imperial service. After some disgrace during Claudius' reign he became tutor and then, in 54 CE, advising minister to Nero, some of whose worst misdeeds he did not prevent. Involved (innocently?) in a conspiracy, he killed himself by order in 65.

Why does it occur? What are the forces that cause the great powers of the industrial era to pursue aggressive foreign policies? Jack Snyder identifies recurrent myths of empire, describes the varieties of overextension to which they lead, and criticizes the traditional explanations offered by historians and political scientists. He tests three competing theories&#x2015;realism, misperception, and domestic coalition politics&#x2015;against five detailed case studies: early twentieth-century Germany, Japan in the interwar period, Great Britain in the Victorian era, the Soviet Union after World War II, and the United States during the Cold War. The Resulting insights run counter to much that has been written about these apparently familiar instances of empire building.</p></p><p><p>Jack L. Snyder is Robert and Ren'e Belfer Professor of International Relations, Columbia University, and author of The Ideology of the Offensive, also from Cornell, and From Voting to Violence: Democratization and Nationalist Conflict.</p><p>"<i>Myths of Empire</i> offers the best-developed theory to date of the domestic sources of international conflict and security policy.... Snyder has taken a major step toward ending the theoretical impoverishment of the study of the domestic sources of international conflict."</p> (<i>American Political Science Review</i>)<br><br><p>"In support of his case, Snyder draws upon recent research into the determinant of foreign policy of the leading powers since the mid-19th century.... Historians and still more international relations specialists will find much of interest in this analysis."</p> (<i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i>)</p><h2>Selections from Kepler&#39;s Astronomia Nova (Science Classics Module for Humanities Studies)</h2><p>Johannes Kepler wrote Astronomia Nova (1609) in a singleminded drive to sweep away the ancient and medieval clutter of spheres and orbs and to establish a new truth in astronomy, based on physical causality. Thus a good part of the book is given over to a nontechnical discussion of how planets can be made to move through space by physical forces. This is the theme of the readings in the present module. The selection includes Kepler&#39;s Introduction as well as a selection of chapters that develop the physics of planetary motion. In these ground-breaking chapters, the true Kepler emerges, not as a speculative mystic or a number-crunching drudge, but as a first-rate scientific thinker with a wonderfully engaging narrative style.</p><p>The translation is quite readable ... Donahue prudently allows Kepler &#39;the courtesy of supposing that what he writes can be understood&#39; [in Donahue&#39;s words], and has managed a translation that preserves a good bit of the style of the Latin: sometimes elevated, frequently jocular, on occasion impassioned. The English almost always seems faithful in tone to the original --Bruce Stephenson, Isis</p><h2>This Poison Will Remain (A Commissaire Adamsberg Mystery)</h2><p><b>Commissaire Adamsberg investigates the death of three men linked by their childhood at an orphanage in Nimes, all killed by the venom of the recluse spider, in the new novel by the #1 bestselling French crime writer</b><br><br><b>&#x201c;A wildly imaginative series.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times<br><br></i>&#x201c;Adamsberg is a terrific creation and his team of misfits a joy to watch in action.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Peter Robinson,&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Inspector Banks series</b><i><br></i></b><br>A murder in Paris brings Commissaire Adamsberg out of the Icelandic mists of his previous investigation and unexpectedly into the region of N�mes, where three old men have died of spider bites.

There, they had belonged to a small group of violent young boys known as the "band of recluses." Adamsberg faces two obstacles: the third man killed by the same venom was not part of the "band of recluses", and the amount of spider venom necessary to kill doesn't add up. <br><br>Yet after the N�mes deaths, more members of the old band succumb to recluse bites, leading the commissaire to uncover the tragedy hidden behind the walls of the orphanage.</p><p><b>Fred Vargas</b> was born in Paris in 1957.

Her books have sold over 10 million copies worldwide and have been translated into 45 languages.I<br><br>Jean-Baptiste Adamsberg, sitting on a rock at the quayside, watched the Grimsey fishermen return with their daily catch, as they moored their boats and hauled up their nets. Here, on this tiny island off the coast of Iceland, people called him simply &#x2018;Berg&#x2019;. An onshore breeze, temperature 11 degrees, hazy sunshine, and the reek of discarded fish entrails. He had forgotten that, not so long ago, he was a commissaire, the police chief in charge of the twenty- seven officers of the Paris Serious Crimes Squad, based in the 13th arrondissement.<br> His mobile phone had fallen into some sheep dung, and the ewe had trodden it firmly in with its hoof, no malice intended. That was a novel way to lose your mobile, and Adamsberg had appreciated it as such.<br> Gunnlaugur, the landlord of the little inn, was just arriving down at the harbour, preparing to choose the best fish for the evening meal.<br> Adamsberg waved to him with a smile. But Gunnlaugur did not look his usual jovial self. He was heading straight for Adamsberg, ignoring the fish market just getting under way. Frowning under his blond eyebrows, he held out a piece of paper.<br> &#x2018;<i>Fyrir �ig,</i>&#x2019; he said &#x2013; with a gesture. <i>For you</i>.<br> &#x2018;<i>�g?</i>&#x2019; <i>Me?</i><br> Adamsberg, who was normally incapable of memorising the most basic rudiments of any foreign language, had inexplicably amassed a stock of about seventy words of Icelandic, in just seventeen days.<br> People spoke to him as simply as possible, with a lot of sign language.<br> From Paris, the message must be from Paris. And they wanted him back, that must be it. He felt combined sadness and anger and shook his head, refusing to look, turning towards the sea. Gunnlaugur insisted, unfolding the paper and thrusting it into his fingers.<br> <i>Woman run over. Husband or lover. Not straightforward. Your presence required. Details follow.</i><br> Adamsberg looked down, opened his hand and let the paper blow away in the wind. Paris? How could it be from Paris? Where was Paris, anyway?<br> &#x2018;<i>Dau&#x2202;ur ma&#x2202;ur?</i>&#x2019; Gunnlaugur asked. <i>Someone&#x2019;s died?</i><br> &#x2018;<i>J�.</i>&#x2019; <i>Yes.</i><br> &#x2018;<i>Ertu a&#x2202;</i> <i>fara, Berg? Ertu a&#x2202; fara?</i>&#x2019; <i>So you&#x2019;re leaving us, Berg? You&#x2019;re leaving?</i><br> Adamsberg drew himself up wearily and looked towards the pale sun.<br> &#x2018;<i>Nei.&#x2019; No.</i><br> &#x2018;<i>J�, Berg,</i>&#x2019; Gunnlaugur sighed. <i>Yes you are, Berg.</i><br> <i>&#x2018;J�,&#x2019; </i>Adamsberg admitted.<br> Gunnlaugur shook his shoulder, pulling him along.<br> &#x2018;<i>Drekka bor&#x2202;a</i>,&#x2019; he said. <i>You must eat, drink.</i><br> &#x2018;<i>Ja.</i>&#x2019; <i>OK.</i><br> The shock, as his plane&#x2019;s wheels touched down on the tarmac at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport, triggered a sudden migraine such as he had not had for years, and at the same time he felt as if he were being battered all over.

His love poems are earthy and transcendent, and his political poems are the work of a man as incisive, impassioned, and ferociously intelligent as he was sensual.

FAULKNER</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>Among the chronicles, memoirs, and remembrances of the making of American literature in the 1920s, Malcolm Cowley&#x2019;s <i>Exile&#x2019;s Return</i> stands alone. Far from the &#x201c;we put on boxing gloves and Ernest Hemingway broke my nose&#x201d; recollections of that shaping period for a national literature, Cowley&#x2019;s work is &#x201c;a narrative of ideas,&#x201d; as he subtitled the original edition of his book, published in 1934. Save for a handful of anecdotes, the book is not an accumulation of silvered memories, but a meditative exploration of the design and goals of literary culture.</p><p>It is a book written by a young man about a young time, and its extolling of a young generation&#x2019;s ability to cast off the baggage of its forebears and forge its own identity has quickened the hearts of generations of readers who have found resonance in its story. It continues to speak. Indeed, <i>Exile&#x2019;s Return</i> is not so much about Paris in the 1920s as it is about the exemplary revolt of one generation against its predecessors in the effort to establish itself.</p><p>Much later in his life&#x2014;Cowley died in 1989 at age ninety after a distinguished career in American letters, the bulk of it spent shaping our estimations of American literature&#x2014;he wrote of the preconditions he saw for both generational self-identification and generational revolt. First among them, he said, is &#x201c;a sense of life, something that might be defined as an intricate web of perceptions, judgments, feelings, and aspirations shared by its members.&#x201d; Next is the generation&#x2019;s &#x201c;thoroughness and even violence in setting aside parental or merely prevailing notions.&#x201d; Then each generation needs to acknowledge its precursors&#x2014;&#x201c;madmen and outlaws,&#x201d; as Cowley called them (borrowing F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x2019;s phrase), who &#x201c;give an intellectual structure to [the generation&#x2019;s] own rebellion&#x201d;&#x2014;and must also witness or participate in &#x201c;historic events,&#x201d; which &#x201c;furnish its members with a common fund of experience.&#x201d; Finally, Cowley stipulated (once more echoing F. Scott Fitzgerald), the generation needs &#x201c;its own leaders and spokesmen.&#x201d; I hasten to add another element that Cowley perhaps took as a given: the group must feel in some fashion betrayed by both prevailing notions and historic events, in order, if only through alienation, to generate both the intricate web and the common fund of experience.</p><p>Although Cowley was speaking broadly, his prescriptions match the characterization early in <i>Exile&#x2019;s Return</i> of his own &#x201c;lost generation.&#x201d; Absent a vivid awareness of the generation&#x2019;s precursors or spokesmen&#x2014;they were to be identified presently&#x2014;the preconditions Cowley later nominated were all present. Particularly powerful, as Cowley presents the making of exiles in <i>Exile&#x2019;s Return</i>, was the sense of betrayal. First, the lost generation was brought to alienation by its education: &#x201c;It was uprooted,&#x201d; Cowley writes, &#x201c;schooled away and almost wrenched away from its attachment to any region or tradition.&#x201d; This was education as deracination. As a young man, Cowley says, he was not being prepared for &#x201c;citizenship&#x201d; or a role in &#x201c;the common life&#x201d; of America, but was instead &#x201c;exhorted to enter that international republic of learning whose traditions are those of Athens, Florence, Paris, Berlin, and Oxford.&#x201d; The bitterness expressed in these statements is quite different from the hymn to childhood Cowley presents in the opening to his first chapter, as though there he is recalling home ground like Candide, who embarks upon a journey na�vely and with the best of intentions, only to be rudely shocked.</p><p>The protagonist of this journey&#x2019;s story was not only Cowley, but an entire prewar literary generation. Trained for a world that existed largely in books, many of this generation volunteered before America&#x2019;s entry into World War I for wartime service in a Europe that no longer existed. The slaughters at Chemin des Dames, the morass of Passchendaele, and the rout of the Italian army at Caporetto, among many other battles, profoundly altered this literary generation&#x2019;s sense of both itself and the world. As Cowley puts it, &#x201c;The generation belonged to a period of transition from values already fixed to values that had to be created.&#x201d;</p><p>Moreover, upon returning to the States from the war, whose end was declared with the November 11, 1918, armistice, the uprooted found themselves exiles in their own land, spectators of a culture they had no hand in creating, and disenfranchised socially, economically, and politically. Boosterism, a new conformity, was dominant. After Sinclair Lewis&#x2019;s social satire <i>Babbitt</i> appeared in 1922, &#x201c;Babbittry&#x201d; became the moniker for this pecuniary vision of repressive progress. Those whose values didn&#x2019;t match the norm were suspect. The Ku Klux Klan had begun its northern migration, the Palmer raids had begun rounding up supposed radicals (including the soon-to-be-celebrated Sacco and Vanzetti), labor organizing efforts were trounced in Seattle and in the coal, rail, and steel industries, and the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, instituting Prohibition, had been passed. Progress and power were praised, intellect and ideas were not. Cynically, after disillusioning trips home where challenging work was not to be found, many of Cowley&#x2019;s ilk migrated to New York, particularly Greenwich Village, where they worked bad jobs, lived in coldwater flats, and generally refound each other. With a shared net of ideas&#x2014;essentially, down with the hypocrisy of business and up with the sanctity of art&#x2014;and a common rejection of contemporary values, they forged a bond. Cowley, thinking back to the war, calls it &#x201c;the long furlough.&#x201d; Given their bleak prospects, many of this lost generation began to think it might not be a bad idea simply to repack their bags, this time with civilian clothes, and head back to France, where the exchange rate favored the dollar and the culture confirmed the images their educations had fed them.</p><p>When in 1921 Harold Stearns, a young intellectual seven years Cowley&#x2019;s elder, decided to abandon America for Paris, his departure confirmed a vacuum suction of expatriation by American artists and writers to Europe. Stearns had written <i>America and the Young Intellectual</i>, and edited <i>Civilization in the United States</i>, a symposium comprising essays by thirty significant contributors whose findings about the nation echoed a remark of Gertrude Stein&#x2019;s on Oakland, California: &#x201c;There is no there there.&#x201d; (Cowley sums up the symposium&#x2019;s findings in a sentence: &#x201c;Life in this country is joyless and colorless, universally standardized, tawdry, uncreative, given over to the worship of wealth and machinery.&#x201d;) The exodus was self-appointed and far from permanent. The writers and artists who preceded and followed Stearns to Europe were less exiles than sojourners: away for a while, but never fully divesting themselves of their American identities.</p><p>As time has proven, the best of them, Hemingway, Dos Passos, Fitzgerald, e.e. cummings, among so many others, became remarkably productive during the decade that followed. Their achievements belied initial assessments of their worth. Reviewing <i>Exile&#x2019;s Return</i> in 1934, William Soskin said, &#x201c;Nobody wrote great books in the last decade. Mr. Hemingway is growing dim. So are his colleagues.&#x201d; Lewis Gannett, an influential reviewer (whose deprecatory remarks helped keep the book&#x2019;s paltry first-year sales, during the heart of the Depression, at 983 copies), had called the exiles nothing more than &#x201c;a little group of serious thinking drunkards&#x201d; who &#x201c;felt there was something superb in starving for three days while waiting for papa&#x2019;s next check.&#x201d; Their legendary intemperance notwithstanding, most of these writers had in fact burned their bridges to home and gotten by on odd jobs, goodwill, and wits.</p><p>In postwar Paris they escaped the &#x201c;hypocrisy and repression&#x201d; of America and found cheap living, laissez-faire standards of conduct, a sense of community (if at times only among themselves), and equally important, a feeling that they were living, creatively unfettered, at the cutting edge of art in the cultural center of the world. Cowley, whose ticket back to France in 1921 came in the form of an extended American Field Service fellowship earned for his volunteer service during the war, studied classical French literature, Racine in particular, but quickly became a keen observer of living intellectual heroes: a prewar generation of American writers who had expatriated earlier, among them Ezra Pound, who frantically fled his admirers and whose elegant <i>Mauberley</i> poems damned the war and its outcome; Gertrude Stein, who had dubbed herself as the doyenne of exiles; and T. S. Eliot, whose seminal poem <i>The Waste Land</i>, which appeared in 1922, confirmed the anomie of the lost generation. There were also non-American exiles, such as James Joyce, whose serial excerpts from <i>Ulysses</i>, and its full publication in 1922, though broadly heralded, were interdicted in England and America as prurient and scandalous.</p><p>Equally important to Cowley were the French writers on the scene: Marcel Proust, Paul Val�ry, and the Dadaists. Proust, though he died in 1922, had left a literary legacy composed in bed in a cork-lined room, his <i>Remembrance of Things Past.</i> &#x201c;The longest novel ever written,&#x201d; it appeared in seven volumes across the remainder of the decade. The poet and thinker Paul Val�ry, who praised form over content and detachment over action, had imposed on himself a twenty-year period of silence, which, Cowley writes, &#x201c;impressed us even more than the high poems and the noble essays he had printed.&#x201d; And finally, there were the nihilistic and iconoclastic Dadaists, among them Tristan Tzara and Louis Aragon, who befriended Cowley, and who regarded European culture, the very culture Cowley had left his own to embrace, as a culture imploding. Independently and collectively these artists presented Cowley with a judgment: &#x201c;Art is separate from life; the artist is independent of the world and superior to the lifelings.&#x201d;</p><p>Cowley was, as he saw it, in the company of the high priests of art. Their ideas were as palpable as their presence in Parisian caf� society. One could, as Cowley did, attend Gertrude Stein&#x2019;s salons, meet with Joyce in his apartment, talk of Shakespeare&#x2019;s historical sources with Pound in the H�tel Jacob, sit with Val�ry on the park benches of the Tuilleries to question his ideas, attend and take part in Dadaist &#x201c;happenings,&#x201d; drink with Tzara or with fellow American exiles in Montparnasse caf�s such as the Select, the Rotonde, or the D�me, and even be praised for the &#x201c;significant gesture&#x201d; of punching the disreputable proprietor of the Rotonde. In Paris, Cowley inhabited a world that appreciated significant gestures.</p><p>In the chapters of <i>Exile&#x2019;s Return</i> entitled &#x201c;Paris Pilgrimages&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Death of Dada,&#x201d; Cowley writes of this heady time, but he also plants the seeds of his discontent. Examining ideas rather than personalities, he finds that the idea of a priesthood in &#x201c;the religion of art&#x201d; both attracts and repulses him. If, in the interest of making art, the choices are to &#x201c;shut oneself up in one&#x2019;s own private world,&#x201d; as Proust did, or to &#x201c;leave the twentieth century behind,&#x201d; as it seemed the exiles were doing&#x2014;choices put forward by Edmund Wilson in his 1931 critical study, <i>Axel&#x2019;s Castle</i> (wherein both choices result in artistic impotence&#x2014;then, Cowley) feels, the frame of the argument is logically wrong, and &#x201c;the religion of art imperceptibly merges into&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a state of mind in which the artist deliberately fritters away his talents through contempt for the idiot-public that can never understand.&#x201d;</p><p>Cowley and the other Paris sojourners of whom he wrote, some of whom stayed for weeks or months, others for years, always intended to return to native soil and never believed in their &#x201c;deracination,&#x201d; beyond what it taught them they could bring back from their exile: new insight into ways of shaping the ideas of that &#x201c;idiot-public&#x201d; of American values. Certainly Cowley thought of them as Americans, not as citizens of some &#x201c;international republic of learning,&#x201d; but as shapers of and contributors to an American culture, despite the prevailing belief that their native culture had no identity and was perilously unaware of its own future. Cowley came back earlier than many of his fellows, in 1923, and immediately found an America whose values were as inhospitable as Paris and the rest of Europe&#x2019;s were welcoming. This was the America of Calvin Coolidge, whose business was business, an America that ignoring worldwide inflation, mortgaged its future on credit, and sang itself songs like &#x201c;Yes, We Have No Bananas.&#x201d;</p><p>The New York to which Cowley returned was &#x201c;a city of anger,&#x201d; and the mixture of idealism and cynicism he imported from his exile was sorely taxed by his failed attempts to continue publication of <i>Broom</i>, the little magazine he worked to edit with Matthew Josephson, a fellow expatriate. Although Cowley makes more of such defeats than their place in American literary history might merit, his examples&#x2014;of post office censorship, of the homophobia of critics&#x2014;amplify the disparity between the cultural, social, and political awareness of his fellow exiles and the American norm.</p><p>Two events finally solidified Cowley&#x2019;s sense of the returned exiles as writers whose duty was to focus their literary efforts on American cultural subjects, and even further, on American political values. The first was the 1927 execution of Sacco and Vanzetti, two men held with questionable evidence on a murder charge in Massachusetts prisons since 1920. The event not only steeled intellectual opinion, it galvanized it. Sacco and Vanzetti were executed, and the returned exiles grieved in solidarity with the rest of the intellectual world, but only until the second event, in October 1929, when the stock market crashed, bringing down with it a whole construct of American values.

The Human Genome Project is generating fundamental genetic information at a breathtaking rate; basic research findings are being applied in medicine, agriculture, and the environment; and a variety of new biotechnology products are moving into production. Behind each of these accomplishments are teams of scientists and technicians whose everyday work makes such achievements possible. </p><p> For the past twelve years, we have been working with students who are beginning their careers as technicians and bench scientists in biotechnology laboratories. In order to best assist our students, we, and our colleagues elsewhere in the United States, have explored what entry level biotechnologists do at work and what abilities they need to perform this work. We have been impressed with the complexity and diversity of technical roles and responsibilities, and the importance of the skills that bench workers bring to their jobs. This book emerges partly from our experiences working with students and our explorations into the nature of the laboratory workplace*. </p><p> This book also results from our personal experiences in the laboratory. As graduate students we struggled to master the "laboratory lore" that was passed among "post-docs" and graduate students in a not always coherent chain. Some of what is in this book is the systematic introduction to laboratory lore that we wish we had received. </p><p> The result of our efforts is not a laboratory manual; this text contains few step-by-step procedures. Nor is it a book about molecular genetics, immunology, or cell culture&#x2014;there are already many excellent specialized texts and manuals on these topics. This book rather is a textbook/reference manual on basic laboratory methods and the principles that underlie those methods. These basics are important to every biotechnologist, regardless of whether one is cloning DNA or purifying proteins, whether one is working in an academic setting or is employed in a company. </p><p> We intend this book to assist students preparing to become biotechnology laboratory professionals, those who already work in the laboratory, and biology students who are learning to operate effectively in the laboratory. Others who may also find this book helpful include high school teachers and their advanced students, and industry trainers. We have endeavored to make this text accessible to beginning college students with a limited science and math background. Some sections, such as the math review in Unit III, could be skipped or skimmed by more experienced readers. At the same time as we tried to make this book practical and accessible, we also endeavored to provide enough background theory so that readers will understand the methods they use and will be prepared to solve the unavoidable problems that arise in any laboratory. </p><p> Although we focus on the biotechnology laboratory, the majority of topics we cover are of importance to individuals working in any biology laboratory. A few topics, such as quality regulations and standards, are included because they are important for those working in biotechnology companies. As biotechnology companies mature, their focus shifts from research into commercial production. As this maturation occurs, scientists and technicians often find that they must add terms like "GMP", "ISO 9000", and "quality systems" to their technical vocabulary. This book therefore weaves a conversation about regulations and standards into many chapters. </p><p> We are aware that the basic methods in this book (such as how to mix a solution or weigh a sample) are less glamorous than learning how to manipulate DNA, or how to clone a sheep. However, we also know that, in practice, the most sophisticated and remarkable accomplishments of biotechnology are possible only when the most basic laboratory work is done properly. </p><p> *The results of some of these discussions about the biotechnology workplace are summarized in the National Voluntary Skill Standards Documents in Agricultural Biotechnology and the Biosciences.

Why do you feel in a slump when you&#x2019;re successful? Where does this malaise come from? And, most importantly, will it ever end?</p><p>Drawing on cutting-edge research, award-winning journalist Jonathan Rauch answers all these questions. He shows that from our 20s into our 40s, happiness follows a U-shaped trajectory, a &#x201c;happiness curve,&#x201d; declining from the optimism of youth into what&#x2019;s often a long, low slump in middle age, before starting to rise again in our 50s.</p><p>This isn&#x2019;t a midlife <i>crisis</i>, though. Rauch reveals that this slump is instead a natural stage of life&#x2015;and an essential one. By shifting priorities away from competition and toward compassion, it equips you with new tools for wisdom and gratitude to win the third period of life. </p><p>And Rauch can testify to this personally because it was his own slump, despite acclaim as a journalist and commentator that compelled him to investigate the happiness curve. His own story and the stories of many others from all walks of life&#x2015;from a steelworker and a limo driver to a telecoms executive and a philanthropist&#x2015;show how the ordeal of midlife malaise reboots our values and even our brains for a rebirth of gratitude. </p><p>Full of insights and data and featuring many ways to endure the slump and avoid its perils and traps, <i>The Happiness Curve </i>doesn&#x2019;t just show you the dark forest of midlife, it helps you find a path through the trees. It also demonstrates how we can&#x2015;and why we must&#x2015;do more to help each other through the woods. Midlife is a journey we mustn&#x2019;t walk alone.</p></p><p>JONATHAN RAUCH, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, is the author of several books and many articles on public policy, culture, and government.

They [readers] will also take comfort from Rauch&#x2019;s personal investment in the subject&#x2015;he has moved through the bottom of his own happiness curve and concludes his heartening self-help book by writing that it was &#x2018;worth the wait.&#x2019;&#x201d; <i>&#x2013;Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"In a youth-obsessed culture, it may be difficult to convince some that life gets better after 50.

Stimulating reading for those seeking enlightenment and joyfulness throughout middle age." <i>&#x2013;Kirkus</i></p><p>&#x201c;Psychologists agree that the midlife crisis is a myth.

He breathed heavily through his nose. &#x201c;We were attacked south of Brod&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;On the way to interrogate General Verhein.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Reinhardt. Something felt wrong in his mouth. There was space and movement where there should not be. He focused on the floor. The tiles were mismatched, different colors, different sizes. He focused on one, fixed his eyes on it, tried to ignore the pacing of the second agent. The one who prowled and struck whenever he wanted to. &#x201c;We were lost. We ended up going south by mistake.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;So you weren&#x2019;t looking for Verhein?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Fingers snaked into his hair, and his head was yanked back.

Reinhardt leaned to the side and spat weakly.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;My driver was dead.&#x201d; He spat, again, watching a tooth roll across the floor.</i></p><p><i>The interrogators laughed. &#x201c;A tooth, Reinhardt? You need to be careful with them. Still, there&#x2019;s plenty more where that one came from, right?!&#x201d;</i></p><p>&#x201c;Captain Reinhardt.&#x201d;</p><p>Reinhardt pulled his eyes back from the past, lifted them over the glass standing untouched between his forearms and the second glass standing brimful across the table. A cigarette burned slowly between his fingers, and a harsh line of light lay across the inside of the tavern. It pulled form from shadow, flowed across the other men in the bar and pushed up against the cigarette smoke that roiled and twisted in the pull of air.</p><p>&#x201c;Captain Reinhardt.&#x201d;</p><p>His back tensed up, and he looked around slowly, looking across the tavern at a sergeant of the Feldgendarmerie standing by the door, his gorget bright across his chest. A second Feldgendarme, a lieutenant, stood to one side, and Reinhardt&#x2019;s stomach clenched, wondering if they had found him at last, and if the man he had been waiting to meet had had anything to do with leading them here.</p><p>&#x201c;Captain <i>Reinhardt</i>. Identify yourself.&#x201d; The Feldgendarmes&#x2019; eyes turned steadily across the room, eyes swinging from face to face, pushing and probing.</p><p>&#x201c;I am Captain Reinhardt,&#x201d; he said, turning and standing.</p><p>The two Feldgendarmes turned toward him as one, and Reinhardt felt real fear. They were not Feldgendarmes. They looked like them. They wore uniforms like a Feldgendarme&#x2019;s, with metal gorgets around their necks, but on their left arms, which had been hidden from him, they wore red bands, with black lettering stenciled across them. On each of them, the Iron Cross shone dully on their left breasts.</p><p>They were Feldjaeger.</p><p>&#x201c;You will come with us,&#x201d; the sergeant said.</p><p>&#x201c;Why? I have done nothing wrong.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We have orders to deliver you to Feldjaegerkorps headquarters.&#x201d;</p><p>The bar went even quieter, if that was possible. Reinhardt said nothing, then swallowed hard at the lump that squatted suddenly in his throat. Had Koenig betrayed him? Had Koenig been trying to get to him to warn him of this?</p><p>&#x201c;What does the Feldjaegerkorps want with me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ask someone who knows what we&#x2019;re talking about,&#x201d; said the lieutenant. &#x201c;Get moving, Captain, and come with us.&#x201d;</p><p>Only the Feldjaegerkorps could speak like that, a junior officer ordering a senior one in that fashion, but whatever pride Reinhardt felt might have been hurt, he ignored it. He looked at his drink, imagined knocking it back, imagined wincing at its burn across his mouth, but he just stubbed out his cigarette and shrugged into his coat, hoping neither of the Feldjaeger would wonder why a man sitting at a table alone would have two drinks in front of him. He picked his way carefully through the silent bar, between the tangle of legs and over puddles of cloth where greatcoats hung over the backs of chairs and spread gray skirts across the tiled floor. The two Feldjaeger split to each side of the door, passing him through, their faces expressionless as they followed him under the dim glow of the entrance light and up a flight of stairs to the darkened streets and into a heavy, wet cold.</p><p>Reinhardt&#x2019;s stomach rumbled and he ran his tongue around his mouth, all thickened and sticky, probing the gap in his back teeth. He clenched his jaw, drawing in a deep breath of cold air. It punched through his teeth, waking him, rooting him firmly. The lieutenant stepped in front of him, and the sergeant put a firm hand on his back and escorted him over to a black car, its outline pearled in the damp air. The lieutenant opened the back door and followed Reinhardt inside, the car rocking and swaying on its suspension. The sergeant clattered the engine into life and then hauled the car out onto the road.</p><p>Reinhardt stared out of his window as they drove, the darkened and blacked-out streets sliding past like a sunken city beyond the sparkled pane of the window. His mind turned over and over what might have happened to put them on to him but could find nothing. They had done nothing, their so-called resistance cell, since July, when the world had seemed to stand still in the aftermath of the attempt on Hitler&#x2019;s life. They had watched as others elsewhere had taken their chance. They had waited as the machine they had hoped had been dealt a death blow had stuttered and then roared back into life. Then they had hoped and prayed for the best, until one of their number had vanished into buildings of concrete and steel and never come out again, and then a second, and the cell had scattered after rushed and furtive good-byes if there were any good-byes at all, eyes hooded far back beneath darkened brows.</p><p>Days, then weeks, then months, almost no news of the others, and no one had come looking, or knocking, until tonight. Reinhardt&#x2019;s mind turned over and over, and he wondered at last, battening onto it with a sudden desperation, why it was the Feldjaeger who had come for him, and not the Gestapo, or the SS.</p><p>The car hammered its way through the wet night, down the wide boulevard of Stubenring, up to what Reinhardt recognized as the old Austro-Hungarian defense ministry building, now one of the main German headquarters in the city. A huge swastika flag hung like a crimson smear down the front of the severe gray structure, all vertical lines and ornate stonework under a copper-colored roof. They drove along the side of the vast building and around the back, weaving through barricades and skirting a spill of rubble from a part of the building that had collapsed in a recent bombing raid.</p><p>The lieutenant motioned Reinhardt out of the car, and he shivered once in the cold. He followed the lieutenant inside, past a pair of Feldjaeger on sentry duty warming their hands at a metal brazier. It seemed even colder inside as he followed the Feldjaeger through the warren of the building, up stairs and around landings and farther up until the lieutenant knocked at a door and opened it, ushering Reinhardt into an anteroom.</p><p>A corporal, his tunic studded with decorations, took Reinhardt&#x2019;s coat and knocked at a second door. A muffled answer came. Reinhardt walked into a long office, a desk standing at one end in front of a fall of heavy curtains, and a lamp with a green shade burned on the desk, carving the face of the officer who sat there into harsh lines of light and shadow. The rest of the room was dark, and it took Reinhardt a moment longer to realize there was a third man in the room, sitting in a deep chair far back in the shadows.</p><p>&#x201c;Captain Reinhardt,&#x201d; said the officer at the desk, as the corporal shut the door with a whisper of wood. The officer indicated a spot in front of the table, and Reinhardt came to attention. The officer was a major and, like all the Feldjaeger he had seen and heard of, wore a clutch of decorations, starting with the Knight&#x2019;s Cross at his throat.</p><p>&#x201c;Captain Gregor Sebastian Reinhardt,&#x201d; the major said, reading from a file on his desk. &#x201c;Born 1898, in K�penick, Berlin. Father, university philosophy lecturer. Mother, housewife. No siblings. Officer cadet school, 1914 to 1916. Active service on the Eastern Front. Transfer to Western Front and induction into stormtroopers in 1917. Served with distinction in Operation Michael. Won Iron Cross at Amiens, 1918. First- and Second-Class Crosses the same day.&#x201d; The major paused, looking up at Reinhardt, his eyes focusing on the Iron Cross. Reinhardt felt desperately uncomfortable under his scrutiny, and that of the other man he could not really see. His skin prickled with sweat, and he forced himself to breathe slowly, evenly, ignoring the slight tremor as he took each breath in.</p><p>&#x201c;Severely wounded,&#x201d; the major continued, speaking of Reinhardt in the third person, &#x201c;and honorably discharged with one third-level invalidity in December 1918. Joined Berlin police force as detective in 1920 and rose to the rank of chief inspector. Posted to Interpol here in Vienna 1938. Resigned from Kripo 1938, joined Abwehr. Assigned as intelligence officer in the invasion of Norway. Won Narvik Shield. Participated in invasion of France, 1940. Invasion of Yugoslavia, 1941. Assigned to Afrika Korps as divisional intelligence staff. Invalided out of Afrika Korps 1942. Assigned to Abwehr office Sarajevo, Partisan counterintelligence.&#x201d; The major paused again, frowned, turned a page, then let it fall back. &#x201c;And this is where a fairly good career derails. Fell afoul of a Gestapo investigation following his role in a murder investigation. A general was implicated, who later died in action.&#x201d; The major looked up. &#x201c;Rather a lot of people were upset with you over that, were they not?&#x201d; Reinhardt was not sure it was a question, and so kept quiet, focusing on a spot just over the major&#x2019;s shoulder, and pushed his tongue into that gap in his teeth. &#x201c;Wounded in action again, questioned&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. intensively&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by the Gestapo. Acquitted. Obviously. But no one seems sure what to do with you. Reassigned from Abwehr and posted in August 1943 as an intelligence liaison officer to 1st Panzer Division in Greece, then to 12th Army in Belgrade. Pretty dull stuff. I think that was the point, no? But it didn&#x2019;t stay that way, did it?&#x201d; The major&#x2019;s eyes needled at him, and his skin prickled tight again. &#x201c;Evacuated to Vienna from Belgrade in October 1944 following the Soviet offensive. Mentioned in dispatches for extreme bravery in covering the retreat from Belgrade. Received the German Honor Roll Clasp in November this year.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a creak of leather as the third man rose and stepped into the light. The third man was a colonel with a head of cropped dark hair shot with gray, a round head balanced on wide shoulders. He stooped over the desk, almost delicately taking the page from the major and turning it back. He read a moment, then looked up at Reinhardt.</p><p>&#x201c;That investigation into General Verhein. In Sarajevo. Tell me about that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What exactly, sir?&#x201d; said Reinhardt, surprised to find his voice steady.</p><p>The colonel pursed his lips, straightening up. &#x201c;At a wild guess, you were told to stop that investigation as soon as you had a general in your sights. But you didn&#x2019;t. What happened?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I pursued an investigation to its end.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Meaning?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I went where the evidence took me rather than where expedience suggested.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me about the retreat from Belgrade.&#x201d; When Reinhardt said nothing, the colonel seemed almost sympathetic. &#x201c;What was the mention in dispatches for?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Covering the retreat of the main field hospital.&#x201d; The colonel said nothing, indicating with his silence that Reinhardt was to continue. &#x201c;I received late intelligence that part of the Soviet advance would threaten the hospital&#x2019;s withdrawal. Communications were down, so I went out to warn them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you gathered together a ragtag bunch, including walking wounded and stragglers, and fought off the Russians long enough for reinforcements to arrive. Quite something. First time going up against the Russians?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Since 1917, yes.&#x201d;</p><p>The colonel snorted, and the major smiled, a flicker across his lips. &#x201c;And?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;d be perfectly happy going another nineteen years before tangling with them again.&#x201d;</p><p>The colonel stared at Reinhardt, then down at the major. Something imperceptible seemed to pass between them, and the colonel folded himself back into the shadows. The major closed Reinhardt&#x2019;s file and rustled a sheet of paper across his fingertips.</p><p>&#x201c;Captain Reinhardt, effective immediately, you are transferred to the Feldjaegerkorps.&#x201d;</p><p>The major&#x2019;s words fell into a heavy silence. Reinhardt stood unspeaking, not believing what he had just heard.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you familiar with the Feldjaegerkorps, Captain?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Major.&#x201d; Reinhardt swallowed. &#x201c;Somewhat.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Enlighten me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Military police.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go on.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But with a difference.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Correct,&#x201d; said the major. &#x201c;The Feldjaegerkorps accepts only decorated combat veterans. Officers and NCOs, no enlisted men. We report directly to the armed forces high command. As such, even a corporal has more authority, should he choose to exercise it, than an officer. We have independent tasking, and full authority to maintain discipline in the army&#x2019;s rear areas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Full authority,&#x201d; repeated Reinhardt. Something seemed to snap inside, that small part of him that could not help but prod and poke and provoke in situations like this. &#x201c;Drumhead courts-martial and on-the-spot executions.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sometimes, yes,&#x201d; the major replied. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s mo...</p></p><h2>Drugstore Cowboy: A Novel</h2><p><b>The novel that inspired the major motion picture directed by Gus Van Sant</b><br><br>Bob Hughes, the offbeat, edgy, and slightly skewed leader of a crew of traveling junkies, describes himself as &#x201c;one of the cleverest and ringiest and most notorious dope fiend drugstore cowboys on the entire West Coast, including Alaska.&#x201d; Bob, his wife, Diane, Rick, and Nadine have a penchant for robbing drugstores and grabbing pills and capsules to support their habit and relieve their boredom. <br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s an all-too-real examination of the addict&#x2019;s domain: the euphoria, the paranoia, the busts, the overdoses, the haunting reality of trying to survive your own world. But James Fogle&#x2014;who based this extraordinary novel on his own experiences, and who spent thirty-five years of his life in prison&#x2014;has turned their lives into something darkly comic. <br> &nbsp;<br> Set in Portland, Oregon, in the early 1970s, <i>Drugstore Cowboy</i> is a resonating evocation of life at the bottom, and yet, by portraying his characters without judgment or glamor, Fogle has illuminated them. His debut novel is a singular work of contemporary fiction.</p><p><b>James Fogle</b> (1936&#x2013;2012) was the author of the autobiographical <i>Drugstore Cowboy</i>. <i>Drugstore Cowboy</i> was turned into an award-winning film in 1989 by Gus Van Sant. The <i>Los Angeles</i> <i>Times</i> described the exploits of the characters in Fogle&#x2019;s book as &#x201c;laced with humor, pathos, and sheer bad luck.&#x201d;Fogle's story of four marauding drug addicts who travel through the Pacific Northwest looting narcotics from drugstore pharmacies was the basis for the movie of the same name. Drawing on his own experience, the author, who has spent 35 of his 53 years in prison, has taken a decidedly downbeat topic--drug addiction--and transformed it into a wry, often satirical commentary on the potential for anarchy and aimlessness in the lives of American youth. Bob Hughes is the ringleader of the group, planning elaborate schemes to distract checkout clerks and pharmacists from the treasured--and locked--narcotics drawers behind the prescription counter. In one such incident, Bob has his "old lady" Diane set fire to a section of merchandise while his partner Rick sets off smoke bombs, with Rick's girlfriend Nadine screaming "Fire!" at the top of her lungs. Fogle's description of the thieves' drug use is realistic yet restrained. The dialogue tends to be hokey, with characters venturing into various ungrammatical speech patterns, and there is annoying sermonizing about rotten police, corrupt politicians and virtuous dope fiends. But overall this is an extremely likable, fast-paced, humorously wrought tale of losers living on the edge. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Building a Bridge: How the Catholic Church and the LGBT Community Can Enter into a Relationship of Respect, Compassion, and Sensitivity</h2><p><p>The <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything</em> and <em>Jesus: A Pilgrimage </em>turns his attention to the relationship between LGBT Catholics and the Church in this loving, inclusive, and revolutionary book.</p><p>On the day after the Orlando nightclub shooting, James Martin S.J.&nbsp;posted a video on Facebook in which he called for solidarity with our LGBT brothers and sisters.

Martin uses the image of a two-way bridge&nbsp;to enable&nbsp;LGBT Catholics and the Church to come together in a call to end the "us" versus "them" mentality. Turning to the Catechism, he draws on the three criteria at the heart of the Christian ministry&#x2014;"respect, compassion, and sensitivity"&#x2014;as a model for how the Catholic Church should relate to the LGBT community.</p></p><p><p>Jesuit priest and <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author James Martin issues an impassioned plea for Catholic leaders to relate to their LGBT flock in a new way, one characterized by compassion and openness. In this inspiring book, Father Martin turns to three virtues from the <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em>&#x2014;&#x201c;respect, compassion, and sensitivity&#x201d;&#x2014;as a model for how both the Catholic leadership and LGBT Catholics can move together on a &#x201c;two-way bridge&#x201d; toward reconciliation and love.&nbsp;</p><p>This groundbreaking new book also includes spiritual and biblical resources for LGBT people and their families, friends, and allies. Father Martin offers biblical passages, accompanied by meditations and questions for reflection, to help LGBT people find their place in the church and enter into a deeper relationship with God. <em>Building a Bridge</em> is a compassionate book desperately needed in today&#x2019;s climate of divisiveness.&nbsp;</p><p>Rev.

Encamped in the shadowlands of the republic, insisting that the Federal government had no right to own public land, the occupiers were seen by a divided country as either dangerous extremists dressed up as cowboys, or as heroes insisting on restoring the rule of the Constitution. From the Occupation&#x2019;s beginnings, to the trials of the occupiers in federal court in downtown Portland and their tumultuous aftermaths, <i>Shadowlands </i>is the resonant, multifaceted story of one of the most dramatic flashpoints in the year that gave us Donald Trump.</p><p>Sharing the expansive stage with the occupiers are a host of others&#x2015;Native American tribal leaders, public-lands ranchers, militia members, environmentalists, federal defense attorneys, and Black Lives Matter activists&#x2015;each contending in their different ways with the meaning of the American promise of Liberty. Gathering into its vortex the realities of social media technology, history, religion, race, and the environment&#x2015;this piercing work by Anthony McCann offers us a combination of beautiful writing and high-stakes analysis of our current cultural and political moment. <i>Shadowlands </i>is a clarifying, exhilarating story of a nation facing an uncertain future and a murky past in a time of great collective reckoning.</p></p><p><b>Anthony McCann </b>is the author of the poetry collections <i>Thing Music</i>, <i>I Heart Your Fate </i>and <i>Moongarden</i>. He currently teaches creative writing at the California Institute of the Arts and in the Low-Residency MFA program of the University of California, Riverside. Born and raised in the Hudson Valley, McCann now lives in the Mojave Desert.<p>"Strikingly empathetic . . . [<i>Shadowlands</i>] is that rare beast these days--a chronicle of and a meditation on an intensely politicized affair that delves beneath merely partisan concerns to touch its subject&#x2019;s absurd and tragic heart. As such, it&#x2019;s a work of almost foolish courage. . . . Scene by scene and act by act, in a range of literary registers that moves from the lyrical to the satirical, from theory-laced deconstruction to meat-and-potatoes reportage, he tells the tale of doomed, homemade rebellion against a force much larger than bureaucracy: the meaning-destroying, resource-gulping juggernaut of capitalist economics." - <i>New York Times Book Review, Editor's Choice</i></p><p>"A riveting in-depth investigation . . . McCann&#x2019;s arresting and brilliant firsthand account is required reading for anyone interested in the ideological gap between the American Left and Right." - <i>starred review, Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"A momentous and important non-fiction debut . . . The core subject is nothing less than the nature of American identity and the concept of freedom. Admirably, McCann&#x2019;s ethos is not that of a neutral bystander but of a truth seeker. He thinks through viewpoints with depth and empathy, but he also takes stands and calls out the problematic for what it is. . . . This is a heavily researched and thoughtful book, written with detail and care, that asks big questions of the reader and of the country." - <i>starred review, Booklist</i></p><p><i>"</i><i>Shadowlands</i> effects an entertaining, sweeping tone, developing cinematically as a colorful latticework of characters are introduced, documented, and pored over. There is no shortage of fascination in this story." - <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></p><p>"An insider account of the Malheur occupation. From the lead-up to the occupation, through the trials and the aftermath, this will be the defining chronicle of a cultural and political moment we could all do better to understand." - <i>Source Weekly</i></p><p>"McCann&#x2019;s account of the 2016 standoff known as the &#x2018;Oregon Occupation&#x2019; defies categorization but is built out of a non-fiction tradition that stretches back to Joan Didion&#x2019;s California essays, Capote&#x2019;s <i>In Cold Blood</i>, and other ambitious works that begin with a violent transgression and radiate outward to take in large swaths of society during a flashpoint crisis. McCann breaks through the accepted narratives of the standoff to get at deeper truths about land in the west, ranching traditions, activist causes, and a host of other issues so central to today&#x2019;s national divide." - <i>CrimeReads</i></p><p>"The story <i>Shadowlands</i> tells is compulsively fascinating, and an excellent microcosm by which we might better understand our difficult national history and distressing political moment. McCann&#x2019;s magnificent prose, ever-questing intellect, wry humor, and uncommon empathy for human and non-human forms of life alike make <i>Shadowlands</i> a truly rare and stunning achievement." - <i>Maggie Nelson, National Book Critics Circle Award winning author of THE ARGONAUTS</i></p><p>"Elegantly rendered and deeply researched, <i>Shadowlands</i> brings seriousness to characters that are easily caricatured, and substance to a subject easily marginalized." - <i>Literary Hub</i></p><p>"Rewarding . . . shreds the reductive narrative foisted upon the occupation, retrieving its participants from caricature." - <i>The Oregonian</i></p><p>"SHADOWLANDS offers fascinating insights and poses interesting questions. . . . a valuable glimpse at a group of often overlooked people contributing to the great divide in American life." - <i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i></p><p>"It is a different tone. If those [other books] are more from that immersion journalism, seat-of-the-pants, gonzo journalism this is more a poetic touch. . . . He takes a different approach that readers might find &#x2018;refreshing&#x2019;." - <i>State of Nevada, Nevada Public Radio</i></p><p>"Wonderful journalistic detailed history, with deep-rooted significance that the writer helps us comprehend both intellectually and viscerally." - <i>Shawangunk Journal</i></p><p>"The SoCal-based poet brings vivid lyricism to <i>Shadowlands</i>, an account of the 2016 right-wing occupation at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge." - <i>Portland Monthly</i></p><p>"With empathy, poetry, and a keen, clear-eyed sense of the weirdness of it all, Anthony McCann goes far beyond the cartoon version of the Malheur occupation that we all watched on the news.<i> Shadowlands </i>is a powerful reckoning with history and all the Big American Words&#x2015;freedom, democracy, sovereignty&#x2015;that echo through the silence and violence of the American West." - <i>Ben Ehrenreich, author of THE WAY TO THE SPRING</i></p><p>"Anthony McCann knows the Western past has not vanished; it has just gotten weirder. <i>Shadowlands</i> takes us down a Western rabbit hole where a delusional settler story staged for the internet on sacred Native ground illuminates the United States we now inhabit.

The first were published in <i>Poetry</i> magazine in 1917; through the decades the writing of cantos gradually became Pound's major poetic occupation, and the last were published in 1968. The complete edition of <i>The Cantos</i> (1970) consists of 117 sections.

Reflecting on the universe&#x2019;s &#x201c;looming abyss of indifference,&#x201d; Thacker explores the pessimism of a range of philosophers, from the well-known (Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Camus), to the lesser-known (E.M. Cioran, Lev Shestov, Miguel de Unamuno). Readers will find food for thought in Thacker&#x2019;s handling of a range of themes in Christianity and Buddhism, as well as his engagement with literary figures (from Dostoevsky to Thomas Bernhard, Osamu Dazai, and Fernando Pessoa), whose pessimism about the world both inspires and depresses Thacker. By turns melancholic, misanthropic, and darkly funny, (&#x201c;Birth is a metaphysical injury &#x2014; healing takes time &#x2014; the span of one's life&#x201d;), many will find <i>Infinite Resignation </i>a welcome antidote to the exuberant imbecility of our times.</p><p>Eugene Thacker is the author of several books, including <i>In the Dust of This Planet</i>. He is Professor at The New School in New York City.A Sort of Preface. By definition, there can be no hope for a book like this &#x2013; its very existence is dubious. If all is for naught, then why bother writing it down? Caught in a&nbsp; vicious circle, ensnared in the logical absurdities of awkward self-awareness.<br><br>It seems there are one of two options: either speak to this situation, or remain silent. The writer&#x2019;s failure is that they know they should choose the latter, but cannot help attempting the former. Writers (and readers...when there are readers...) console themselves by naming this failure: an apology, a confession, a testimony, a treatise, a history, a biography, a life. But the continual accumulation of that- which-cannot-be-put-into-words always points back to this one basic realization &#x2013; that, when it comes to human beings, silence is the most adequate form of expression.<br><br>There are, then, two paths. Ultimately writers dream of taking neither path, leaving all paths for the forest. But it&#x2019;s just a dream.</p><h2>A Critique of Postcolonial Reason: Toward a History of the Vanishing Present</h2><p><p>Are the "culture wars" over? When did they begin? What is their relationship to gender struggle and the dynamics of class? In her first full treatment of postcolonial studies, a field that she helped define, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, one of the world's foremost literary theorists, poses these questions from within the postcolonial enclave.</p><p>"We cannot merely continue to act out the part of Caliban," Spivak writes; and her book is an attempt to understand and describe a more responsible role for the postcolonial critic. <i>A Critique of Postcolonial Reason</i> tracks the figure of the "native informant" through various cultural practices--philosophy, history, literature--to suggest that it emerges as the metropolitan hybrid. The book addresses feminists, philosophers, critics, and interventionist intellectuals, as they unite and divide. It ranges from Kant's analytic of the sublime to child labor in Bangladesh. Throughout, the notion of a Third World interloper as the pure victim of a colonialist oppressor emerges as sharply suspect: the mud we sling at certain seemingly overbearing ancestors such as Marx and Kant may be the very ground we stand on.</p><p>A major critical work, Spivak's book redefines and repositions the postcolonial critic, leading her through transnational cultural studies into considerations of globality.</p></p><p>In her first full treatment of postcolonial studies, a field that the helped define, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, one of the world&#39;s foremost literary theorists, attempts to describe a responsible role for the postcolonial critic within the postcolonial enclave.

It is designed for students at the undergraduate level or for others needing a broad synthesis of the long history of literary theory. An introductory chapter provides an overview of some of the major issues within literary theory and criticism; further chapters survey theory and criticism in antiquity, the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the nineteenth century. For twentieth- and twenty-first-century theory, the discussion is subdivided into separate chapters on formalist, historicist, political, and psychoanalytic approaches. </p> <p> The final chapter applies a variety of theoretical concepts and approaches to two famous works of literature: William Shakespeare&#x2019;s <em>Hamlet</em> and Mary Shelley&#x2019;s <em>Frankenstein</em>. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Anne H. Stevens</strong> is Associate Professor of English at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. </p><p> &#x201c;A skillful balancing of erudition and accessibility, Anne Stevens&#x2019;s <em>Literary Theory and Criticism</em> is a welcome and much-needed addition to the small number of books that introduce theories of literature in the classroom. Stevens deftly paints the myriad political, historical, and cultural contexts of major theoretical movements&#x2015;including nascent fields such as the digital humanities&#x2015;while keeping the discussion grounded and pragmatic. Moreover, Stevens not only explains methodology, but also offers method for young critics in search of a primer on literary study. <em>Literary Theory and Criticism</em> deserves a slot on the bookshelves of students, scholars, and teachers of literature everywhere.&#x201d; &#x2015; David Roh, University of Utah </p> <p> &#x201c;<em>Literary Theory and Criticism: An Introduction</em> is an excellent resource that will help students understand what literary critics do, how they came to do it, and, equally important, why they do it. Beginning with Plato and Aristotle, this book provides an overview of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the Enlightenment, before tracing the birth of literary criticism as a profession in the nineteenth century and outlining the major movements it gave rise to in the twentieth and twenty-first. In providing this historical overview and highlighting the key terms and figures that shape scholarly conversations, Anne Stevens demonstrates the centrality to the field of criticism of such approaches as postcolonial theory, feminist theory, queer theory, and ecocriticism and describes in unfailingly clear prose how each shapes our understanding of literature.&#x201d; &#x2015; Cristobal Silva, Columbia University </p> <p>&#x201c;An extremely lucid and wide-ranging guide to literary theory for undergraduates.

We now consider minstrelsy an embarrassing relic, but once blacks and whites alike saw it as a black art form&#x2015;and embraced it as such. And, as the authors reveal, black minstrelsy remains deeply relevant to popular black entertainment, particularly in the work of contemporary artists like Dave Chappelle, Flavor Flav, Spike Lee, and Lil Wayne. <em>Darkest America</em> explores the origins, heyday, and present-day manifestations of this tradition, exploding the myth that it was a form of entertainment that whites foisted on blacks, and shining a sure-to-be controversial light on how these incendiary performances can be not only demeaning but also, paradoxically, liberating. 12 illustrations</p><p>&#34;Before Yuval Taylor and Jake Austen wrote this important book, the minstrel era had regressed into vague and dusty African-American history; its aftereffects were felt but little understood. Darkest America plunges us back into an unenlightened age and shows us that the villains and the heroes aren&#39;t always who we thought they were. Taylor and Austen&#39;s book is a meticulously researched, eye-opening, action-packed read.&#34; --James Gavin, author of Stormy Weather: The Life of Lena Horne<p><strong>Yuval Taylor</strong>, senior editor at Chicago Review Press, is the author of <em>Zora and Langston: A Story of Friendship and Betrayal</em> and coauthor of <em>Darkest America: Black Minstrelsy from Slavery to Hip-Hop</em> and <em>Faking It: The Quest for Authenticity in Popular Music</em>.

He took up law, left it for public speaking, then turned to full-time writing, producing the wide range of subject matter and literary form which is represented in this collection.<br><br> A master of the vivid scene, Lucian used his pungent style to ridicule the tyrants, prophets, waning gods, and hypocrite philosophers of his own day and the centuries preceding him. His most typical genre is a parody of a Platonic dialogue, but he also excelled in straight narrative, as in the elaborate spoof "A True Story" and the old folk tale outrageously retold, "Lucius, the Ass." His skeptical mind and imaginative irony have influenced generations of artists and writers, and now in Professor Casson's new translations can be freshly enjoyed today.</p><p>&#39;Lucian&#39;s genial mockery, &#39; writes Lionel Casson, &#39;aimed at man&#39;s omnipresent failings, is never out of date: the jabs he gave the hypocrites, grandstanders, fakers, and boobs of the ancient world can just as appropriately be administered to their counterparts of the modern.&#39;<p> <i>Lionel Casson</i> is emeritus professor of classics at New York University, and is well-known as a lecturer and writer on the Greek and Roman Theater as well as books on the topic of ancient maritime travel.

Naturopathic physician Lise N. Alschuler and medical journalist Karolyn A. Gazella present an overview of what cancer is, its causes and preventative strategies, an in-depth approach to integrative treatment options, descriptions of key body functions, and discussions of more than twenty specific cancers. <i>The Definitive Guide to Cancer</i>, now in its third edition, encourages you to take an integrative approach that embraces both alternative and conventional therapies across the spectrum of cancer prevention, treatment, and healing.</p><p>LISE N. ALSCHULER, ND, FABNO, is a naturopathic physician with widely recognized expertise as a speaker, author, and practitioner of integrative medicine.<br>&nbsp;<br>KAROLYN A. GAZELLA is an accomplished author, health writer, and publisher of the <i>Natural Medicine Journal</i>.<b>The Cancer Experience<br></b><br>Cancer results from the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells. As these cells continue to divide, they form into cancerous tumors. With destructive precision, a cancerous tumor redirects blood flow to itself as it leaches off its healthy cellular neighbors. Cancer cells can invade other tissues within the body and produce additional tumors. The frenzied development of a cancerous tumor can overwhelm the organ or tissue where it is located. Left unchecked, many cancers can eventually destroy enough tissue that the body loses its ability to sustain life.<br><br>This monstrous demolition can be mirrored emotionally in the person with cancer. The physical chaos and damage is only a part of the story. Cancer brings with it thundering amounts of anger, anxiety, or fear, which can render someone less able to cope emotionally. Even for the most stoic of souls, three simple words--&#x201c;you have cancer&#x201d;-- can create a simmering internal panic. This panic can be both reflected and magnified in loved ones. A cancer diagnosis goes well beyond the patient, and takes its toll on loving family and friends as well. Sometimes it can be even more difficult being a caregiver or support person and watching a loved one struggle.<br><br>Although a cancer diagnosis can bring on a fear of dying, cancer is not a death sentence. That may be difficult to believe if you are in the throes of a recent diagnosis or struggling with treatment. However, not all people diagnosed with cancer physically succumb to the disease. And even among those who do die from cancer-related causes, there are some who experience tremendous wellness and healing in the process. Cancer offers an opportunity for deep reflection and introspection, no matter what the outcome of the disease. It helps us consider the whole of life rather than the sum of its material parts.<br><br>Coping with cancer requires us to first embrace it. After it shakes us to our very core, we concede the emotional storm it has created. During a conversation with mind-body-spirit pioneer Rachel Naomi Remen, MD, who has worked with thousands of cancer patients, she explained that ignoring fear can prevent us from healing. She recommends that people with cancer invite it in. &#x201c;Although it is expressed in a very constricting way, fear is the will to live. What&#x2019;s under the fear is a desire for life, and we need to somehow get to that. That means going through the fear, not denying it.&#x201d; Discovering our inner strength enables us to face the unknowns associated with a cancer diagnosis. Over the years, Dr. Remen has found that &#x201c;the experience [of having cancer] can be transformative.&#x201d;<br><br>For both patients and their loving supporters, this will be a highly individualized and personal process. There is no right way to cope with cancer. Whether you are the one with the diagnosis or a loved one is, you will want to patiently take one step at a time.<br>&nbsp;<br>The first step is to understand what cancer is.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Cancer Defined<br></b><br>Technically, cancer is not one disease. It is a complex illness with more than 200 variations. A cancer malignancy is characterized as a locally invasive and destructive growth pattern caused by the development of genetically altered cells. The cancer is typically designated based on the organ it originates in. There are five major types of cancer:<br><br>� Carcinomas, the most common type of cancerous growth, are solid tumors that may affect almost any organ or part of the body. They can spread to other parts of the body via the lymphatic fluid or the bloodstream. Carcinomas may occur in the skin, mouth, nose, throat, lungs, genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts, and glands, such as the breasts or thyroid.<br><br>� Leukemias form in the blood and bone marrow and are not solid tumors. The abnormal white blood cells associated with leukemias replace healthy white blood cells and circulate throughout the bloodstream.<br><br>� Myelomas are tumors that originate in bone marrow plasma cells, the antibody-producing white blood cells. Myelomas were formerly considered rare, but their incidence is increasing.<br><br>� Lymphomas are cancers found in the glands and nodes of the lymphatic system. Lymph nodes are the body&#x2019;s filtering system, helping to remove toxins and impurities. These small, round masses of tissue are concentrated in the neck, groin, armpits, spleen, center of the chest, and around the intestines. Lymphomas are solid tumors usually made up of abnormal white blood cells. Hodgkin&#x2019;s and non-Hodgkin&#x2019;s lymphoma are the most common forms of lymphatic cancer in the United States.<br><br>� Sarcomas are the rarest of the five types. Sarcomas are solid tumors that arise from connective tissue, such as bone and muscle. Sarcomas can also form in the surrounding connective tissues of major organs, including the bladder, kidneys, liver, lungs, and spleen.<br><br>The process of developing cancer is known as carcinogenesis, which literally means &#x201c;the birth of cancer.&#x201d; The cancer process begins with damage to a cell. Specifically, one or more genes in cellular DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) become damaged, which is referred to as genetic mutation. This is significant because DNA is the critical information-carrying part of the cell. When the DNA is repeatedly damaged, the cell loses its ability to repair the damage, begins to behave abnormally, and divides uncontrollably. Scientists have confirmed that genetic mutations activate the process of carcinogenesis. This becomes important when considering ways to prevent cellular damage to ward off cancer, something we&#x2019;ll discuss in subsequent chapters.<br><br>As damaged or malignant cells divide, more mutations occur, a process known as promotion. Malignant cells eventually become numerous enough to join together to form a solid tumor, or they simply circulate throughout the body, wreaking havoc on other healthy cellular systems. Most anticancer therapies attempt to halt the growth of cancerous cells. Radiation therapy and some chemotherapy agents damage DNA so much that the malignant cells can no longer divide; instead, they undergo a process either of cellular rupture and destruction or of apoptosis, which may be thought of as cellular suicide. Other chemotherapy agents interrupt the process of cell division, effectively halting cellular replication and eventually sending the cell down the path of apoptosis.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>How Does Cancer Grow?<br></b><br>Rapidly growing cancer cells are not only hearty, they are demanding. Their appetite for nutrients, oxygen, and blood far exceeds that of healthy cells. At the same time, they can also survive under a variety of internal conditions. According to a recent issue of Cancer Research, Japanese researchers discovered that, despite their voracious needs, cancer cells also have an amazing ability to tolerate extreme conditions, including a low supply of nutrients and oxygen. They discovered that cancer cells have the ability to modify their energy metabolism to sustain growth while simultaneously minimizing their need for nutrients and energy. Cancer cells can also develop resistance to specific chemotherapy drugs. It is this adaptability and resilience that makes cancer such a daunting and dangerous opponent.<br><br>Like a biochemical vampire, the cancer cell&#x2019;s nectar of choice is blood. The human body is fertile ground for these bloodthirsty cells. As long as the cancer cell has access to blood, it is less likely to die. In fact, cancer cells go to great lengths to ensure they have a sufficient blood supply. The body&#x2019;s process for developing blood vessels is known as angiogenesis. Cancer cells hijack this mechanism by sending signals to existing blood vessels, redirecting their growth and creating their own blood supply. Finding ways to shut down the blood supply to a cancerous tumor, known as antiangiogenesis, is critical to stopping its growth. Tumor cells produce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to help create new networks of blood vessels that will grow toward the tumor. Drugs and natural substances that block the action of VEGF will prevent the formation of new blood vessels and in so doing deprive the tumor of the nutrients it needs to grow, thrive, and spread.<br><br>Cancer cells aren&#x2019;t bound by the same rules of internal cellular control as are normal cells. Self-preserving cancer cells produce telomerase, an enzyme that allows the cancer cell to override the process that normally limits the life span of the cell. The presence of telomerase contributes to the abnormally long life of a cancer cell. Another critical internal control mechanism that has gone awry in cancer cells has to do with repairing cellular damage. Healthy cells contain tumor suppressor genes, which suppress cell division to allow a damaged cell to repair itself or, if the damage is too great, to self-destruct (as mentioned previously, this is known as apoptosis). Tumor suppressor genes are often underactive in cancer cells. The most recognized tumor suppressor gene is p53. Unfortunately, this key gene is one of the genes most susceptible to damage. In fact, p53 is damaged in over 50 percent of all cancers. This can be caused by a variety of toxic and inflammatory insults that cause oxidative damage to the gene. Some people also inherit a susceptibility to sustaining damage to this tumor suppressor gene. If the p53 tumor suppressor gene can&#x2019;t do its job, cancer cells are free to break the rules and continue dividing despite being damaged. Finding effective ways to stimulate apoptosis in cancer cells before they become too resistant and overpowering is a critical component in any integrative treatment approach. At present, a great deal of cancer research is focused on compounds that can activate tumor suppressor genes or can stimulate apoptosis.<br><br>Unfortunately, cancer is adaptable and those cancer cells that are best adapted will survive, with their survival characteristics becoming stronger with each new generation of cells. Basically, cancer will do everything it can to survive and grow. Unlike healthy cells, cancer cells that metastasize (move from one part of the body to another) exhibit little or no cell-to-cell adhesion. Most cells in the body--other than circulating blood cells--bond with one another to form well-defined tissues. Cancer cells, on the other hand, are free agents thoroughly adapted to foster their own growth and movement. Once metastasis has occurred, cancer becomes more powerful and much more difficult to treat. This is when cancer can be most life-threatening.<br><br>While it is clearly a complicated disease process, carcinogenesis and tumorigenesis are examples of basic biology gone awry. What should be a simple biological procedure of cell division and growth can quickly turn into a chaotic and complex illness. A seemingly innocent mutation multiplies exponentially with no boundaries or limitations, following its own rules. The aggressive intruder then steals oxygen, nutrients, and blood from unassuming healthy cells in order to survive and thrive. A bountiful blood supply, growth factors, circulating hormones, and many other contributors encourage its growth and sustainability. From this process, the life-changing diagnosis of cancer emerges.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Cancer Diagnosis<br></b><br>Treatment success is dependent upon accurate information. It is important to determine exactly where the cancer exists and the type of cancer cells present.<br>The primary cancer site is the part of the body where the cancer first develops. Even if the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it is always described in terms of the primary site. For example, if pancreatic cancer spreads to the liver, it is still referred to as pancreatic cancer; specifically pancreatic cancer metastatic to the liver. According to the National Cancer Institute&#x2019;s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) training module, knowing the primary site is critical in diagnosis and treatment because it may help determine how the tumor will behave. The most common primary cancer sites are the skin, lungs, breasts, prostate, and colon.<br>&nbsp;<br>The main techniques used to determine if cancer is likely to be present are as follows:<br>� Direct observation, including signs and symptoms<br>� Advanced imaging technologies<br>� Lab tests<br>&nbsp;<br>Ultimately, diagnosis depends upon looking at the suspicious tissue under a microscope. Tissue must be removed for this microscopic evaluation. This procedure is called a biopsy. The National Cancer Institute textbook Informed Decisions states that &#x201c;biopsy is preferred to establish, or rule out, a diagnosis of cancer.&#x201d; This confirmation provides conclusive evidence needed to avoid misdiagnosis. Testing of cancerous tissue samples can also provide valuable information regarding type, grade, and stage, which will help determine the most effective treatment plan.</p><h2>Wings of the Morning (Kensington Chronicles, Book 2)</h2><p><p>Victoria "Smokey" Simmons stands silently on deck as her father's body is lowered into the Atlantic, asking God for the strength she will need to command the <i>Aramis</i> alone.

But if this is true, it&#x2019;s time to take a closer look at what we say and sing and do each week.&nbsp;Drawing from his own discovery of ancient worship practices, Glenn Packiam helps us understand why the Church made creedal proclamations and Psalm-praying a regular part of their worship.

Written around 1748 as a puppet play, it is now better know in Kabuki performances. In the twentieth century, cinema and television versions have been equally successful. Donald Keene here presents a complete translation of the original text, with notes and an introduction that increase the reader&#39;s comprehension and enjoyment of the play. The introduction also elucidates the idea of loyalty. This traditional virtue, as exemplified in Chushingura, has never completely lost its hold on audiences, in spite of twentieth-century changes in Japanese society and moral ideas. Moreover, as Professor Keene points out, the excitement, color and violence expressed in the play may be considered the counterpoint to the austere restraint and understatement which are more commonly thought to be &#34;traditionally&#34; Japanese.<p>Donald Keene is Shincho Professor of Japanese Literature and University Professor Emeritus at Columbia University.

She has published fourteen works of fiction and one nonfiction book. Her connection with the Amish community has been widely featured in national media outlets. Cindy and her husband reside near the foothills of the North Georgia Mountains in their now-empty nest.</p>As Samuel was helping Rhoda gather cards, Landon&#x2019;s cell phone buzzed, and he reached into his pocket. He usually glanced at it and slid it back into his pocket unless his grandmother was calling. But this time his smile faded, and he held the phone out toward Samuel. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the number<br> from your family&#x2019;s farm in Pennsylvania.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Since the only phone for this place was in the barn office and they spent very little time out there when it was below freezing, Samuel had given Landon&#x2019;s number to his Daed in case of an emergency. The room grew quiet, and all eyes were on Samuel. He took the phone and slid his finger<br> across the screen. <i>&#x201c;Hallo.&#x201d;</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Samuel, what&#x2019;s going on up there?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His Daed&#x2019;s tone was severe, and a bad feeling washed over Samuel. &#x201c;Can you hold for a few minutes and let me get elsewhere?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ya.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Samuel got up, hitting the mute button. &#x201c;I need to talk to him, but apparently there isn&#x2019;t an emergency.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Leah tossed her cards onto the pile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m done.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Landon and Steven nodded and gathered the cards. Clearly, the mood was broken. Samuel had fielded many more calls from his Daed lately, each one less tolerant of this new settlement than the previous call.<br> &nbsp;<br> Leah moved from the floor to the couch. &#x201c;For him to stay this riled, he must be on that Amish chat line again, hearing negative stuff about us.&#x201d; She sighed and rolled her eyes. &#x201c;They ought to call it what it is&#x2014;the Amish gossip line.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Leah, <i>kumm alleweil.</i>&#x201d; Steven&#x2019;s gentle correction was meant to settle her, and as the only church leader for this new settlement, his words carried weight. <br> &nbsp;<br> While walking into the kitchen, Samuel turned off the mute. &#x201c;Hey, Daed. I&#x2019;m surprised you&#x2019;re using Landon&#x2019;s cell when there&#x2019;s no emergency.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It might be a crisis. What&#x2019;s this rumor I&#x2019;ve heard about Leah seeing that Englisch assistant of Rhoda&#x2019;s?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Samuel pressed his lips together. Which of the new Amish families that had moved here over the last six months had shared that information? Apparently someone intended to end the relationship. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Leah is in her <i>rumschpringe, </i>Daed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But I let her leave Pennsylvania under your charge, and I&#x2019;m not going to put up with these rumors.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Dozens of arguments ran through Samuel&#x2019;s mind. As he opened his mouth to rebut, he saw movement in the living room that caught his attention.<br> &nbsp;<br> The three women&#x2014;Rhoda, Leah, and Phoebe&#x2014;had moved to the couch. Arie was sitting in Leah&#x2019;s lap, and her hair had been taken down from its bun. Leah brushed Arie&#x2019;s hair as the women whispered and giggled. They worked hard and loved deeply. He&#x2019;d never witnessed the kind of unison they had.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Samuel,&#x201d; his Daed growled, &#x201c;are you even listening to me?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Samuel&#x2019;s mouth went dry as angst grabbed hold of him. He&#x2019;d been clinging to the hope that if he handled the situation right between his Daed and Leah, he could keep all the relationships intact. Had it been a false hope?<br> &nbsp;<br> The Amish had ways of applying constant pressure when they disagreed with someone&#x2019;s behavior, and if that failed to change the person&#x2019;s actions, he or she was shunned. Not officially through the church, but through mandatory actions that said you&#x2019;re not welcome here anymore unless you change. How could he possibly shun Leah? Worse, how could Rhoda and Phoebe do so? But if it came to the point of shunning her and they didn&#x2019;t do as told, they would be subject to the same treatment. <br> &nbsp;<br> Besides, Steven was a church leader now. He and Phoebe would have to uphold the <i>Ordnung, </i>or the consequences would be unbearable. Maybe Daed just needed a reminder of who was the spiritual head here.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Steven is working with Leah, praying for her, guiding her as he sees fit.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s young, not yet thirty, and some don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s handling the Old Ways as carefully as he should. Others doubt he should&#x2019;ve been chosen since his sister remains under a shadow of doing witchcraft.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s absurd. Rhoda doesn&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Save it, Samuel. I heard on the chat line that a bishop in Berks County is thinking of moving his family to your area. If he does, he&#x2019;ll outrank Steven and bring the kind of order Orchard Bend Amish should&#x2019;ve had all along.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Every Amish person who&#x2019;d helped establish this new settlement firmly believed in the Amish ways and culture, but they had pushed a lot of lines since arriving here sixteen months ago. Their hearts were in the right place, but sometimes the Amish rules got in the way of believers following their consciences. That&#x2019;s when those on Orchard Bend Farms bent the rules, and Samuel didn&#x2019;t regret doing so.<br> &nbsp;<br> Somehow Samuel had to stop his Daed from doing anything that would cause the Old Ways to move into this home like a poisonous gas, choking the breath out of the relationships. <br> &nbsp;<br> But how?</p><h2>Spark Joy: An Illustrated Master Class on the Art of Organizing and Tidying Up (The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up)</h2><p><b>The follow-up to the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i>The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, </i>from the star of the<i> </i>hit Netflix series <i>Tidying Up with Marie Kondo</i>.</b><br><br> Japanese decluttering guru Marie Kondo has revolutionized homes&#x2014;and lives&#x2014;across the world.

That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;ve devoted most of my life to the study of tidying. I want to help as many people as possible tidy up once and for all.&nbsp;<br> This doesn&#x2019;t mean, however, that you should just dump anything and everything. Far from it. Only when you know how to choose those things that spark joy can you attain your ideal lifestyle.<br> If you are confident that something brings you joy, keep it, regardless of what anyone else might say. Even if it isn&#x2019;t perfect, no matter how mundane it might be, when you use it with care and respect, you transform it into something priceless. As you repeat this selection process, you increase your sensitivity to joy. This not only acceler-ates your tidying pace but also hones your decision-making <br><br> capacity in all areas of life. Taking good care of your things leads to taking good care of yourself.<br><br> <b>What sparks joy for you personally? And what doesn&#x2019;t?<br></b><br> The answers to these questions represent a major clue for getting to know yourself as a recipient of the gift of life. And I am convinced that the perspective we gain through this process represents the driving force that can make not only our lifestyle, but our very lives, shine.<br> Some people have told me that they had almost <br><br> nothing left after discarding those things that didn&#x2019;t spark joy and, at first, didn&#x2019;t know what to do. This reaction seems particularly common when people finish tidying their clothes. If it happens to you, don&#x2019;t be discouraged. The important thing is that you have noticed. The real tragedy is to live your entire life without anything that brings you joy and never even realize it. From the moment you finish tidying, you can begin to add a new zest to your home and to your life.&nbsp;<br><br> Only two skills are necessary to successfully put your house in order: the ability to keep what sparks joy and chuck the rest, and the ability to decide where to keep each thing you choose and always put it back in its place.&nbsp;<br><br> The important thing in tidying is not deciding what to discard but rather what you want to keep in your life. It is my hope that the magic of tidying will help you create a bright and joyful future.</p><h2>Living Lent: Meditations for These Forty Days</h2><p><p>For centuries the words and poetry of our hymns have spoken to us of God.

That head belonged to Steve, a construction company boss with a bleeding balance sheet. He&#x2019;d been in the job for just four months when his CEO asked me to come in and help him.<br><br>That morning, I&#x2019;d taken the elevator to the eighth floor, waited in the reception area, and was finally shown to Steve&#x2019;s palatial office by an assistant whose voice shook slightly when she announced my name. As the door closed silently behind me, Steve didn&#x2019;t look up from his computer, acknowledging my presence only with a long sigh and an aggressive flurry of mouse clicks. Which left me standing there, awkwardly staring at his head and admiring the contents of a presentation cabinet. It included a large award in the shape of a demolition ball, and that really said a lot about the situation.<br><br>I&#x2019;m not easily unnerved, but as the seconds dragged by, I began to feel the challenge that lay ahead of me as a sensation of mild nausea. It didn&#x2019;t help that I was holding a red folder bulging with interview notes that told me just how volatile this man could be.<br><br>&#x201c;Should I take a seat?&#x201d; I finally ventured.<br><br>&#x201c;Please, Dr. Eurich,&#x201d; he sighed impatiently, still not looking up. &#x201c;Whatever makes you comfortable.&#x201d;<br><br>As I sat down and opened my folder, ready to begin, Steve pushed his chair back. Finally, he looked at me. &#x201c;Let me tell you a thing or two about my operation here.&#x201d; Then, with the restlessness of a caged tiger, he began pacing up and down behind his desk, sharing his ambitious vision for the business and his hardball leadership philosophy. I was impressed with his energy&#x2014;�I also knew that our work together would require all he could muster.<br><br>Steve&#x2019;s department, he told me, was in trouble, although I already knew that. His predecessor had been fired because of cost overruns, so his in-�the-�red business unit needed to drive growth while finding efficiencies wherever possible. There was no room for failure, but Steve had no doubt that he was just the man for the task. His self-�proclaimed leadership skills included setting high expectations, rallying his troops, and being tough but fair. &#x201c;I know I&#x2019;ll face challenges in this role,&#x201d; he confidently stated, &#x201c;but I also know how to get the best out of my �people.&#x201d;<br><br>Unfortunately, Steve was totally delusional.<br><br>What I&#x2019;d uncovered when I interviewed his direct reports, and what his CEO had only begun to sense, was that Steve&#x2019;s reign was already proving disastrous. In the 16 weeks since his official promotion, three employees had quit. A fourth, who had recently started taking blood pressure medication because of the &#x201c;Steve stress,&#x201d; was halfway out the door. Though not a single member of Steve&#x2019;s team questioned his capabilities and experience, they thought that he was&#x2014;�to use a more polite term than they did&#x2014;�a complete jerk. He&#x2019;d bark orders at them, question their competence, and scream at them in a way they found unprofessional and frightening. And they weren&#x2019;t a bunch of whiners, either. I found them to be seasoned, seen-�it-�all types who weren&#x2019;t looking to be coddled. Steve had simply pushed them too far.<br><br>To be fair, Steve had grown up in the rough-�and-�tumble industry of construction, where he&#x2019;d learned that great leadership often meant &#x201c;he who yelled the most.&#x201d; And while this hard-�charging style may have been passable in the past, it was a costly miscalculation in his current role, especially against the backdrop of the company&#x2019;s collaborative culture.<br><br>As he paced around his new office, proudly detailing all the ways he was exactly the visionary leader his company needed during this difficult period, I marveled at how utterly oblivious he was. His behavior was hurting his employees&#x2019; morale, his team&#x2019;s performance, and his own reputation. Even losing some of his best people hadn&#x2019;t shaken his self-�image as an effective and respected leader. But Steve&#x2019;s team had had enough of his bullying. And somehow, I had to find a way to break that to him. More fundamentally, Steve lacked the single most important, and yet least examined, determinant of success or failure&#x2014;�in the workplace, or anywhere else. I&#x2019;ve spent the last four years studying self-awareness. My research team and I quantitatively surveyed thousands of people around the world in ten separate investigations. We analyzed nearly 800 scientific studies. We conducted in-depth interviews with dozens of people who made dramatic improvements in their self-�awareness.<br><br>While a precise definition is more complex than it first seems, self-�awareness is, at its core, the ability to see ourselves clearly&#x2014;�to understand who we are, how others see us, and how we fit into the world. Since Plato instructed us to &#x201c;know thyself,&#x201d; philosophers and scientists alike have extolled the virtues of self-�awareness. Indeed, this ability is arguably one of the most remarkable aspects of being human. In his book The Telltale Brain, neuroscientist V. S. Ramachandran poetically explains:<br><br>Any ape can reach for a banana, but only humans can reach for the stars. Apes live, contend, breed and die in forests&#x2014;�end of story. Humans write, investigate, and quest. We splice genes, split atoms, launch rockets. We peer upward . . . and delve deeply into the digits of pi. Perhaps most remarkably of all, we gaze inward, piecing together the puzzle of our own unique and marvelous brain . . . This, truly, is the greatest mystery of all.<br><br>Some have even argued that the ability to understand ourselves is at the core of human survival and advancement. For millions of years, the ancestors of Homo sapiens evolved almost painfully slowly. But, as Ramachandran explains, about 150,000 years ago, there was an explosive development in the human brain&#x2014;�where, among other things, we gained the ability to examine our own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, as well as to see things from others&#x2019; points of view (as we will learn, both of these processes are absolutely critical for self-�awareness). Not only did this create the foundation for higher forms of human expression&#x2014;�like art, spiritual practices, and language&#x2014;�it came with a survival advantage for our ancestors who had to work together to stay alive. Being able to evaluate their behaviors and decisions and read their impact on other members of the tribe helped them, to use a slightly more modern reference, not get voted off the island.<br><br>Flash forward to the twenty-�first century. Though we may not face the same day-�to-�day threats to our existence as our ancestors did, self-�awareness is no less necessary to our survival and success&#x2014;�at work, in our relationships, and in life. There is strong scientific evidence that people who know themselves and how others see them are happier. They make smarter decisions. They have better personal and professional relationships. They raise more mature children. They&#x2019;re smarter, superior students who choose better careers. They&#x2019;re more creative, more confident, and better communicators. They&#x2019;re less aggressive and less likely to lie, cheat, and steal. They&#x2019;re better performers at work who get more promotions. They&#x2019;re more effective leaders with more enthusiastic employees. They even lead more profitable companies.<br><br>On the flip side, a lack of self-�awareness can be risky at best and disastrous at worst. In business, regardless of what we do or what stage we&#x2019;re at in our careers, our success depends on understanding who we are and how we come across to our bosses, clients, customers, employees, and peers. This becomes even more important the higher we ascend on the corporate ladder: senior executives who lack self-�awareness are 600 percent more likely to derail (which can cost companies a staggering $50 million per executive). And more generally, un-�self-�aware professionals don&#x2019;t just feel less fulfilled in their careers&#x2014;�when they get stuck, they tend to have trouble figuring out what their next phase should even be.<br><br>The list goes on and on. After so many years of researching the subject, I would go so far as to say that self-�awareness is the meta-�skill of the twenty-�first century. As you&#x2019;ll read in the pages ahead, the qualities most critical for success in today&#x2019;s world&#x2014;�things like emotional intelligence, empathy, influence, persuasion, communication, and collaboration&#x2014;�all stem from self-�awareness. To put it another way, our self-awareness sets the upper limit for the skills that make us stronger team players, superior leaders, and better relationship builders. And here, even small gains in self-awareness can have a big payoff.<br><br>Now, you&#x2019;d certainly be hard-pressed to find many people who don&#x2019;t instinctively know that self-�awareness is important. After all, it&#x2019;s a term we tend to toss around pretty freely �about our boss, our colleagues, our in-�laws, our politicians. Although have you noticed that when we do, it&#x2019;s usually in the negative, as in &#x201c;so-�and-�so just isn&#x2019;t self-�aware&#x201d;? Despite the critical role it plays in our success and happiness, self-�awareness is a remarkably rare quality.<br><br>For most people, it&#x2019;s easier to choose self-�delusion&#x2014;�the antithesis of self-�awareness&#x2014;�over the cold, hard truth. This is particularly true when our delusion masquerades, as it often does, as insight. I recently picked up Travis Bradberry&#x2019;s best-�selling book Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and I was astonished to learn that over the last decade, our collective emotional intelligence (EQ) has improved. (EQ is the ability to detect, understand, and manage emotions in ourselves and others, and countless studies have shown that people who have it are more successful, more resilient, more tolerant of stress, better at building relationships, and more.) But in my work as an organizational psychologist, Bradberry&#x2019;s findings didn&#x2019;t match what I had observed: at least anecdotally, I&#x2019;ve seen low EQ becoming more, not less, of a problem in recent years.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t until I took the online assessment that came with the book that I identified the stunning source of the discrepancy. While, yes, Bradberry&#x2019;s research involved a staggering 500,000 people, his conclusions were based on their own self-�assessments. Think about that for a minute. Picture a few of the least emotionally intelligent people you know. If you asked them to evaluate their own EQ, how much would you bet that they&#x2019;d see themselves as at least above average? So an alternative, and far more likely, explanation for Bradbury&#x2019;s findings is a growing gap between how we see ourselves and what we really are. In other words, what looked like an increase in EQ was more likely a decrease in self-�awareness.<br><br>Our increasingly &#x201c;me&#x201d;-�focused society makes it even easier to fall into this trap. Recent generations have grown up in a world obsessed with self-�esteem, constantly being reminded of their wonderful and special qualities. It&#x2019;s far more tempting to see ourselves through rose-�colored glasses than to objectively examine who we are and how we&#x2019;re seen. And this isn&#x2019;t just a generational problem, or even just an American one&#x2014;�it afflicts people of all ages, genders, backgrounds, cultures, and creeds.<br><br>Right now, you might be mentally conjuring all the delusional people you know and chuckling&#x2014;�the co-�worker who thinks he&#x2019;s a brilliant presenter but puts everyone to sleep in meetings; the boss who brags about being approachable but terrifies her team; the friend who thinks she&#x2019;s a &#x201c;people person&#x201d; but is always the most awkward guest at the party. Yet there&#x2019;s something else we all need to consider. As the Bible asks, &#x201c;How can you say to your brother, &#x2018;Let me take the speck out of your eye,&#x2019; when all the time there is a plank in your own eye?&#x201d; (Matthew 7:4). Whether it&#x2019;s at work, at home, at school, or at play, we&#x2019;re quick to accuse others of being unaware, but we rarely (if ever) ask ourselves whether we have the same problem. Case in point: in a survey that I conducted among potential readers of this very book, a full 95 percent reported that they were either somewhat or very self-�aware!<br><br>The truth is that while most of us think we know ourselves pretty well, this confidence is often unfounded. Researchers have established that our self-�assessments &#x201c;are often flawed in substantive and systematic ways.&#x201d; As you&#x2019;ll read more about soon, studies show that we tend to be terrible judges of our own performance and abilities&#x2014;�from our leadership skills to our car-�driving prowess to our performance at school and at work. The scariest part? The least competent people are usually the most confident in their abilities.<br><br>And in most cases, the planks in our eyes are pretty obvious to everyone but us. A tone-�deaf college student who drops out of school to become a singer. A braggadocious boss who reads scores of business books but remains a terrible leader. A parent who spends very little time with his kids but thinks he&#x2019;s &#x201c;Dad of the Year.&#x201d; A thrice-�divorced woman who&#x2019;s convinced that the end of each marriage was her ex&#x2019;s fault. <br><br>But being overconfident about our abilities isn&#x2019;t the only way that low self-�awareness can play out. Sometimes we lack clarity about our values and goals, causing us to perpetually make choices that aren&#x2019;t in our best interests. Other times, we fail to grasp the impact we&#x2019;re having on the people around us, alienating our colleagues, friends, and families without even knowing it.<br><br>Now, if that&#x2019;s what unawareness looks like, the next logical question becomes: What does it mean to be self-�aware? When I began my four-�year empirical research program on the subject, answering this question seemed like a rather straightforward place to start. Yet I was stunned to learn just how many conflicting definitions existed. Without a clear definition of self-�awareness, though, how could I possibly develop a method to help people improve it? So my research team and I spent months reviewing hundreds of studies to see what patterns emerged. In the process, we unearthed two main categories of self-�awareness that, strangely, weren&#x2019;t always related.<br><br>Internal self-�awareness has to do with seeing yourself clearly. It&#x2019;s an inward understanding of your values, passions, aspirations, ideal environment, patterns, reactions, and impact on others. People who are high in internal self-�awareness tend to make choices that are consistent with who they really are, allowing them to lead happier and more satisfying lives. Those without it act in ways that are incompatible with their true success and happiness, like staying in an unfulfilling job or relationship because they don&#x2019;t know what they want.<br><br>External self-�awareness is about understanding yourself from the outside in&#x2014;�that is, knowing how other people see you. Because externally self-�aware people can accurately see themselves from others&#x2019; perspectives, they are able to build stronger and more trusting relationships. Those low in external self-�awareness, on the other hand, are so disconnected with how they come across that they&#x2019;re often blindsided by feedback from others (that is, if others are brave enough to tell them). And very often, by the time they hear this feedback, their relationships are too far gone to be salvaged.</p><h2>Vampires Don&#39;t Wear Polka Dots (The Adventures Of The Bailey School Kids)</h2><p>The hugely popular early chapter book series re-emerges with a new look!

But when Camilla Capybara joins Rodney&#39;s class and announces that she is bigger, meaner, and smarter than any of the other rodents, everyone is afraid. It seems she really is bigger, meaner, and smarter than all of the rest of them. Until our unwitting hero, Wodney Wat, catches Camilla out in a game of Simon Says. Read along with Wodney as he surprises himself and his classmates by single-handedly saving the whole class from the big bad bully. Children will delight as shy Rodney Rat triumphs over all and his tiny voice decides the day, R&#39;s or no R&#39;s.</p><p>Lynn Munsinger&nbsp;is the illustrator of many&nbsp;funny and popular books for children, including the stories starring Tacky the Penguin and&nbsp;Wodney Wat. She divides her time between Connecticut and Vermont.<br><br>Helen Lester and Lynn Munsinger have been together through thick and thin since first publishing <em>The Wizard, the Fairy, and the Magic Chicken</em> in 1983. They have collaborated on the hilarious Tacky the Penguin series and many other wildly funny and popular titles, including the award-winning <em>Hooway for Wodney Wat</em>. Helen Lester is a full-time writer who makes her home in New York, and Lynn Munsinger is a full-time illustrator living in Vermont."The team responsible for the Tacky the Penguin books and Princess Penelope's Parrot (1996), among others, is in rare form in this picture book, in which a swell little guy proves himself a hero to his tormentors. Wodney Wat has a problem: he can't pronounce the letter r, which makes him the butt of constant jokes and teasing. He's so distressed, in fact, that he routinely buries his head in his jacket--the closest he can come to actually disappearing. He thinks he's really in for it when "big, mean, smart" Camilla Capybara appears in Miss Fuzzleworth's classroom. But the tables are deftly turned when Wodney is tapped to lead a game of Simon Says: when he says "Go West" after a tough round of play, guess who does. Munsinger's well-detailed illustrations are superbly funny, a perfect complement to a comical story that will not only make kids laugh but also hearten those who feel they'll be outsiders forever." Booklist, ALA<br><br>"Rodney Rat, who can't pronounce his R's, is the shyest, most miserable kid in school, until one day he saves his classmates from the mean bully Camilla Capybara. Wodney's transformation from cowering to empowered is beautifully underscored in the humorous, expressive illustrations. Appealingly, Wodney doesn't need to overcome his impediment to be liked--and it's the impediment itself and Wodney's clever use of it that foils the villain." Horn Book<br><br>A shy rodent turns his defect into strength to overcome class bully and save the day. Every page is a delight in this imaginative book, which culminates in surprising word play. Energetic illustrations capture perfectly the characters of timid Rodney, the overbearing Camilla Capybara, and their rowdy rodent classmates.<br>Parent's Choice (R)</p><h2>Sex Addicts Anonymous: 3rd Edition Conference Approved</h2><p>The basic text of the SAA fellowship, <i>Sex Addicts Anonymous </i>explains sex addiction from the SAA perspective and demonstrates, through examples, how sex addiction worsens over time. It describes the personal powerlessness and unmanageability of sex addiction, and the damage to personal relationships, livelihood, and physical health that is often caused by addictive behavior.&nbsp; <br> <br><i>Sex Addicts Anonymous</i> conveys a vision of hope for the addict through a recovery program based on the time-honored Twelve Steps that were initially proposed for alcoholics. A separate section of the book offers a variety of personal stories from individual members of the fellowship to illustrate the challenges and the hope of recovery. <br> <br>&nbsp;</p><p>Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA) is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other so they may ovecome their sexual addiction and hlep others recover from sexual addiction or dependency.<p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>We are sex addicts. Our addiction nearly destroyed our lives, but we found freedom through the recovery program of Sex Addicts Anonymous. In the fellowship of SAA, we discovered that we are not alone and that meeting regularly together to share experience, strength, and hope gives us the choice to live a new life. </p> <p>Our addictive sexual behavior was causing pain&#x2015;to ourselves, our friends, and our loved ones. Our lives were out of control. We may have wanted to quit, making promises and many attempts to stop, yet we repeatedly failed to do so. For each of us, there came a moment of crisis. When we finally reached out for help, we found recovery through the program of SAA.</p> <p>We have found, through long and painful experience, that we are unable to achieve recovery from sexual addiction through our own efforts. Our program is based on the belief, confirmed by our experience, that a Power greater than ourselves can accomplish for us what we could not do alone. By surrendering our addiction to a Higher Power, we receive the gift of recovery, one day at a time. </p> <p>Sex Addicts Anonymous is a spiritual program based on the principles and traditions of Alcoholics Anonymous. Although we are not affiliated with AA or any other organization, we are deeply grateful to AA for making our recovery possible. </p> <p>Our primary purpose is to stop our addictive sexual behavior and to help others recover from sexual addiction. We find a new way of living through the SAA program, and carry our message to others seeking recovery. Membership is open to all who have a desire to stop addictive sexual behavior. There is no other requirement. Our fellowship is open to women and men, regardless of age, race, religion, ethnic background, marital status, or occupation. We welcome members of any sexual identity or orientation, whether they are gay, lesbian, straight, bisexual, or transgender. </p> <p>In our groups, there is a collective wisdom that has grown and been handed down over the years. We learn many new solutions to old problems. Central to these are the Twelve Steps, a spiritual program of recovery. Following these steps leads to freedom from addictive sexual behaviors and to the healing of our minds, bodies, spirits, relationships, and sexuality.</p> <p>Desperation brought us together. We found in each other what we could find nowhere else: people who knew the depth of our pain. Together we found hope and the care of a loving Higher Power. Our commitment is to help others recover from sexual addiction, just as we have been helped. This book contains our stories and our wisdom. It is dedicated to sex addicts everywhere. </p> <p>�2005 International Service Organization of SAA, Inc.. All rights reserved.

The coordinated focus of these materials is unique: biblical content, provocative questions, systematic theology, practical application, and the gospel story of God&#x2019;s grace presented all the way through Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Philip Graham Ryken,</strong> President, Wheaton College</p><p>&#x201c;These <em>Knowing the Bible</em> volumes introduce a significant and very welcome variation on the general run of inductive Bible studies. Such series often provide questions with little guidance, leaving students to their own devices. They thus tend to overlook the role of teaching in the church. By contrast, Knowing the Bible avoids the problem by providing substantial instruction with the questions. Knowing the Bible then goes even further by showing how any given passage connects with the gospel, the whole Bible, and Christian theology. I heartily endorse this orientation of individual books to the whole Bible and the gospel, and I applaud the demonstration that sound theology was not something invented later by Christians, but is right there in the pages of Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Graeme Goldsworthy,</strong>&nbsp;Former Lecturer in Old Testament, Biblical Theology, and Hermeneutics, Moore Theological College</p><p>&#x201c;What a gift to earnest, Bible-loving, Bible-searching believers! The organization and structure of the Bible study format presented through the <em>Knowing the Bible</em> series is so well conceived. Students of the Word are led to understand the content of passages through perceptive, guided questions, and they are given rich insights and application all along the way in the brief but illuminating sections that conclude each study. What potential growth in depth and breadth of understanding these studies offer. One can only pray that vast numbers of believers will discover more of God and the beauty of his Word through these rich studies.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bruce A. Ware,</strong>&nbsp;T.

And create Power it must, for without it your business is at risk. He explains why invention always comes first and then develops the Power Progression to enable you to target when your Power must be established: in the origination, take-off or stability phases of your business. Every business faces a do-or-die strategy moment: a crux directional choice made amidst swirling uncertainty. To get this right you need at your fingertips a real-time strategy compass to discern your true north. 7 Powers is that compass.</p><p>Hamilton Helmer has spent his career as a practicing business strategist.

Starting with recipes for three master doughs that can be made with commercial yeast, as well as a brief intro to sourdough starters, <i>Perfect Pan Pizza</i> illustrates how to make several styles of pan pizza including Detroit-style "deep pan" pizza, focaccia and schiacciata, and Roman and Sicilian styles through step-by-step photographs. The pizzas include classic toppings like pepperoni and mushrooms, as well as an exciting variety of recipes like the sandwich-inspired Philly-style Roast Pork and Broccoli Rabe; Reuben pizza; Bacon and Egg with Tomato and Arugula Pizza; Blue Cheese, Balsamic Onion Marmalade, and Walnut Focaccia; and Rosemary Garlic Potato, Baby Kale, and Prosciutto Pizza Al Taglio. With unique recipes, plenty of informative FAQs for beginners, and a permissive and inspiring tone, this book will appeal to both experienced bread bakers and novice home pizza makers alike.</p><p><b>Peter Reinhart </b>is widely acknowledged as one of the world's leading authorities on bread. He is the author of ten books on bread, including the James Beard Award- and IACP cookbook award-winning <i>The Bread Baker's Apprentice</i>, and <i>American Pie: My Search for the Perfect Pizza</i>. He appears regularly on television and radio, and he is a full-time baking instructor at Johnson and Wales University, a culinary and keynote presenter at conferences around the world, and the founder and host of the popular video website PizzaQuest.com.INTRODUCTION<br><br>WHY THIS BOOK AND WHY NOW?<br><br>This book is a celebration of pizzas made in pans, perennial classics that are now being reinvented by those who know how to evoke their full flavor potential. Pizza, I would risk saying, is the most popular food in the world. There are many forms and variations of pizza, but in the end pizza is simply dough with something on it. And yet, in its simplicity, it is amazingly delicious. Something magical happens when dough is combined with a topping; making pizza the perfect flavor-delivery system. Dough with something on it just works.<br><br>In the United States and in a number of other countries, many pizza permutations have come and gone. There are, however, some styles that have earned perennial popularity, like the Neapolitan-inspired round pizza with sauce and cheese, which has come to be regarded, by many (but not all), as the prototype on which all other pizzas are based. Other configurations with different names have, from time to time, attempted to capture some of that doughwith-something-on-it cach�, such as focaccia, <i>schiacciata</i>, flatbreads, quesadillas, tostadas, and even grilled cheese sandwiches (albeit, a sandwich is more of a dough with something in it). All of these are spokes of the same wheel, all of them simply variations on a theme but one dominated by the word pizza. For example, some of the best-tasting pizzas at this moment are actually, in the strictest sense of the word, focaccia, but are marketed as pizza because the public (outside of Genoa) loves and trusts the term <i>pizza</i> more than it does <i>focaccia</i>.<br><br>Some of the types of pizza that fall within this pan-pizza subcategory include focaccia (the pizza of Northern Italy, most notably associated with Genoa in Liguria), <i>schiacciata</i> (the Tuscan version of focaccia), Sicilian-style (perhaps inspired by, though different from, the original <i>sfingiuni</i> of Sicily but now a designated style of its own), and the two currently hottest subcategories of them all, Roman-style al taglio (&#x201c;baked in a pan&#x201d;) and Detroit-style deep-pan pizza, revered for its crispy, cheesy frico edge (more on this later) and its crackly, buttery undercrust. Detroit-style deep-pan pizza is not a new idea or style, having been &#x201c;invented&#x201d; almost eighty years ago by former autoworker Gus Guerra. Now you can find it under other names in many cities other than Detroit. What is surprising is that it has taken so long for it to become so popular. We&#x2019;ll get into the specifics in chapter 4.<br><br>Until recently, few knew about Detroit&#x2019;s unique square pizza, and even those who were from Detroit didn&#x2019;t call it Detroit-style. Then, after sixty years of regional obscurity and cultish secrecy, this newly named Detroit-style, long in Chicago&#x2019;s shadow, finally became an idea whose time had come, and now to our great benefit it&#x2019;s popping up everywhere.<br><br>We have arrived at a unique, paradigm-changing moment in which artisan pizza masters are turning out the best versions of these styles that have ever been produced. As a result, the hidden gems, not just the sexy wood-fired and coal-fired classics but the more homey pan-style versions&#x2014; the deep square-pan and sheet-pan styles (the focaccia, Sicilian, and Grandma pies) and now even the newly emerging Roman-style al <i>taglio</i>&nbsp;cut-with-a-scissors pizzas&#x2014;are transcending their old neighborhood standbys and are being given newer expression. Today&#x2019;s artisans are pushing the envelope and redefining the realm of the possible in this paradoxically simple-yet-complex perfect flavor-delivery system called pizza.<br><br>Culinary artisanship is meeting global archetype, and we, the public, are the beneficiaries of a new golden age of pizza expression. The purpose of this book is to show you, the home cook, how to replicate the artisan techniques that have brought about this pan-pizza renaissance and thereby create pizzas equal to anything you will find at a pan-style pizzeria. This is not a tribute book about the many landmark pan-pizza establishments doing great work, though many of them, like Buddy&#x2019;s in Detroit, Brown Dog in Telluride, Liguria Bakery in San Francisco, Pizzarium in Rome and Chicago, Triple Beam in Los Angeles, and many others, have provided inspiration. It is a book about how you can make your own pan pizzas with the same explosive flavor perfection as the pies from those iconic places. To help you achieve that goal, I have included techniques that I&#x2019;ve discovered or developed during my thirty years as an artisan baker, pizza maker, and educator. Happily, I&#x2019;ve been able to combine them all in an easy method so that whether you are an experienced or a novice cook, you will soon be making not just good but truly memorable pizzas for your friends and family.<br><br>As I discuss the different styles, I&#x2019;ll explain more about the methodology and supplemental ingredients and provide recipes not only for the dough but also for the toppings. I&#x2019;ve met many pizza masters through my research and my ongoing website PizzaQuest.com, and based on the information they have shared with me, I have&nbsp;been able to distill the essential secrets of their successes and methods. The pizza world is a generous community, so there are very few secrets. This is because the truly great pizzaioli know that the real secret is in the craft itself, which is acquired only through relentless practice. As the great American pizza master Chris Bianco told me, &#x201c;I can teach people my techniques, but I can&#x2019;t teach them to care as much as I care.&#x201d; This observation is probably the most important takeaway from all my research and inquiry into what separates good from great: it boils down to how much you care.<br><br>As you achieve success through these very accessible formulas and pan-pizza recipes, I hope you will be inspired to care as much as those artisans who bring honor to their craft. Even if you never become a professional pizza maker (only a very few will ever choose to work that hard), I believe that by tapping into a level of greatness through these pan pizzas, you will experience the sought-after, memorable sound of crust and all that comes with it. When you experience greatness in anything, even pizza, it spills over into the rest of your life and changes you forever.<br><br>In the following chapters, you will find recipes for sauces, condiments, and over thirty variations of pan pizzas. Although this is not an exhaustive list of recipes, it will provide a foundation and inspiration from which you can create an infinite number of variations of your own. These recipes also include commentaries and options for ingredient substitutions and tweaks. There is also a Resources section (page 175) with suggestions for finding ingredients, tools, books, and more information.<br><br>Yes, I&#x2019;m promising you a lot here, so let&#x2019;s get started!</p><h2>Rick Steves Belgium: Bruges, Brussels, Antwerp &amp; Ghent</h2><p><b>Stroll through medieval squares with soaring bell towers and along quiet canals: with Rick Steves on your side, Belgium can be yours!

Written by famed political theorist Thomas Paine, this pamphlet boldly challenged the authority of the British government and the royal monarchy to rule over the American colonists.</p> <p></p> <p>By using plain language and a reasoned style, Paine chose to forego the philosophical and Latin references made popular by the Enlightenment era writers. As a result, Paine united average citizens and political leaders behind the central idea of independence and transformed the tenor of the colonists&#x2019; argument against the British. As the best-selling American title of all time, <i>Common Sense</i> has been eloquently described by historian Gordon S. Wood as "the most incendiary and popular pamphlet of the entire revolutionary era."</p> <p></p> <p>Thomas Paine (1737&#x2013;1809) was an English-American political activist, philosopher, and revolutionary. As one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, he authored the most influential pamphlets at the start of the American Revolution and inspired the colonists to declare independence from Great Britain in 1776. His ideas reflected Enlightenment-era rhetoric of transnational human rights and the separation of church and state. He has been called a corset-maker by trade, a journalist by profession, and a propagandist by inclination.</p></p><p>English-born Thomas Paine left behind hearth and home for adventures on the high seas at nineteen. Upon returning to shore, he became a tax officer, and it was this job that inspired him to write The Case of the Officers of Excise in 1772. Paine then immigrated to Philadelphia, and in 1776 he published Common Sense, a defense of American independence from England. After returning to Europe, Paine wrote his famous Rights of Man as a response to criticism of the French Revolution. He was subsequently labeled as an outlaw, leading him to flee to France where he joined the National Convention. However, in 1793 Paine was imprisoned, and during this time he wrote the first part of The Age of Reason, an anti-church text which would go on to be his most famous work. After his release, Paine returned to America where he passed away in 1809.</p><h2>The Berenstain Bears and the Double Dare</h2><p><b>This classic Berenstain Bears story is a perfect way to teach children about being an individual and how to resist bad influences!<br></b><br>Come for a visit in Bear Country with this classic First Time Book� from Stan and Jan Berenstain.

The real essence of being a princess cannot be purchased in a store! &nbsp;The impulse to write this book came after my 4-year-old, Annie, asked me the fateful question, "Mommy, do princesses have to wear hiking shoes?" &nbsp;Before I had time to take a breath, Annie blurted another "do princesses" question, followed by another. (Yeah, it was awesome.)&nbsp;Simply put, Annie was wondering if she "qualified" as a princess, in the precise little package she was already in; mismatched socks, denim, rough and tumble, yet with a flair for pink. &nbsp;And yet, anything goes. &nbsp;If wearing a puffy skirt and tiara is your thing... then go for it.

(Bright &amp; Early Books(R))</h2><p>Dr. Seuss has always been welcome in every reader's home, but in this Bright and Early Book classic, Marvin K. Mooney's welcome has been worn out! In merry verse and illustrations, Marvin is asked to leave by every conceivable means of transportation. He can leave by lion's tail or stamp himself and go by mail. By stilts or Crunk-Car or Zumble-Zay, it's time that Marvin was on his way. Will Marvin <i>ever</i> get the hint? <br><br> Combining brief and funny stories, easy words, catchy rhythm, and lively illustrations, Bright and Early Books are an ideal way to introduce the joys of reading to children.</p><p>Oh, why won't Marvin K. Mooney just please go now? In this 1972 classic for "beginning beginners," Dr. Seuss devotes his rhymes to budging the reluctant young Marvin K.: "The time has come. The time is now. Just go. Go. GO! I don't care how." But despite his impatience, our narrator certainly isn't short of ideas on how Marvin could make an exit. "You can go on stilts. You can go by fish. You can go in a Crunk-Car if you wish." Seuss's ever wacky illustrations accompany each new mode of transport, from balloon to broomstick to Bumble-Boat. And if those who are just learning find a word they don't know, chances are Seuss has simply made it up to fill out this ear-pleasing, easy-to-read text. This book is yet another fun and euphonious entry from the good doctor, a silly primer for budding rhymers and readers. (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Paul Hughes</i>Illus. in full color.

A zany, insightful story that beginning readers will wish to hear again and again!</p><p>Another silly title from the Beginner Books series (the same place that Dr. Seuss and the Berenstains hang their hats), <i>I Wish That I Had Duck Feet</i> follows one little guy's dreams of borrowing all sorts of useful appendages from the animal world. "I wish that I had duck feet. And I can tell you why. You can splash around in duck feet. You don't have to keep them dry." But each time he imagines something new--those duck feet, a prickly pair of deer horns perfect for playing football, a spraying whale spout to keep his classroom cool--he realizes that it's not always all it's cracked up to be. "BUT... If I had a long, long tail, I know that Big Bill Brown would tie me in a tree! He would! Then how would I get down?" A vacuuming mom and pipe-smoking dad are straight out of '60s suburbia (<i>Duck Feet</i> first came out in 1965), but the playful illustrations and catchy rhymes still make for good fun. (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Paul Hughes</i>Illus. in full color. &#34;This zany story of a boy&#39;s wishes for duck feet, a whale spout, deer horns, a long tail, elephant&#39;s trunk, etc. will be a favorite with young readers.&#34;--&#34;School Library Journal.</p><h2>Colonial Voices: Hear Them Speak: The Outbreak of the Boston Tea Party Told from Multiple Points-of-View!</h2><p><b>Follow an errand boy through colonial Boston as he spreads word of rebellion. </b><p>It's December 16, 1773, and Boston is about to explode! King George has decided to tax the colonists' tea. The Patriots have had enough. Ethan, the printer's errand boy, is running through town to deliver a message about an important meeting. As he stops along his route at the bakery, the schoolhouse, the tavern, and more readers learn about the occupations of colonial workers and their differing opinions about living under Britain's rule.

Grade 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;Colonial Bostonians introduce themselves through free-verse vignettes that describe their work and their feelings about the current political situation. As errand boy Ethan moves about the city, he links the people together. From the printer, who distributes the news of a gathering to be held, to the baker, the school mistress, the shoemaker, the milliner, and so on, he covers a territory that ends up at the Old South Meeting House. There, the Sons of Liberty decide to protest the governor's decision regarding some shipments of British tea. Winters's poems flow well, but they employ somewhat complex vocabulary and syntax. A glossary is included to help children with terms such as "fripperies," "journeyman," "limner," "hackle," and "wag-on-the-wall." Historical notes go into more detail about each person's job and compare similar positions in the northern and southern colonies. Both men and women are portrayed; while most characters are white, a Native American woman and a male African slave are also featured. The political sentiments described include Patriots, Loyalists, and some in-between. The watercolor and ink illustrations add humor and drama through shifting perspectives and well-detailed settings full of period details. Ethan appears in each picture, and children will enjoy following his route and sharing his reactions to the varied scenes he observes. A unique presentation for all libraries.&#x2014;<i>Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She divides her time between Chatham, New York, and New York City.Grade 1-3&#x2013;As storm clouds gather ominously in the Irish sky, three diminutive leprechauns rouse themselves to dig up their pot of gold and place it at the end of the coming rainbow. Ari hurries Col and Boo along the country road, intent on accomplishing their task, but the friends cant resist stopping to pull some mischievous pranks along the way, because thats what leprechauns do. They paint the hooves of Mrs. Ballybunions cow bright scarlet, tie Old Jamie Bradleys drying long johns into a knot, and plant a yellow tennis ball in the nest of Miss Maudie Murphys hen. At last, as the raindrops begin to fall, the playful tricksters reach Padddywhackers Bog, dig up their treasure, and set it in place. As the rainbow arches across the sky to touch the pot of gold, the trio settles down to wait, but nobody finds the gold, as usual. Ari cheers up his disgruntled pals, saying That golds waiting for just the right person. McCully graces this lighthearted story with her characteristically expressive and charming watercolors that eloquently capture the verdant beauty of the Irish countryside and the irrepressible personalities of the elves. An explanatory note about leprechauns is appended. A perfect choice for March story hours, this title can also be enjoyed all year long.<i>&#x2013;Linda L.

The world is immense. Take a good look around and decide what makes sense...</b></p><p>On the occasion of her son's graduation from high school, Sandra Boynton, the well-loved creator of books and cards featuring hippos, dinosaurs, and sheep, has written a celebratory book for "onwardly mobile" readers. Everyone on the planet will compare this title to Dr. Seuss's <i>Oh, the Places You'll Go</i>, and we will, too. Yes, they're both delightful, silly picture books with vaguely unidentifiable critters as the emcees, rejoicing in the reader's recent graduation or other success. Festive exclamation points abound, along with rhyming, and alternating cheering and questioning ("Now what will you do?"). But Sandra Boynton is Sandra Boynton, and Dr. Seuss is Dr. Seuss, and ne'er the twain shall meet. Boynton's more contemporary text and illustrations feature a cow doing yoga ("OOM") and a headphone-clad fellow listening to "great rock-and-roll," among her other trademark characters flying away under balloons, partaking of chocolate, and scrambling up mountains. A box on the first page with "CONGRATULATIONS" across the top and "To" and "From" below make it perfectly clear that this is a book for giving. Behind all the goofy faces and simple rhymes is a very real, very sweet sentiment of pride and support that any loving friend or family member will be glad to share with that special successful person, young or old. Boynton's style can be recognized a mile away in such classics as <i>Dinos to Go</i>, <i>Hippos Go Berserk!</i>, and <i>Moo, Baa, La La La!</i>.

Six years later, he was named chairman of the board and CEO of Koch Industries, Inc. Today, Koch Industries&#x2019; estimated worth is $100 billion -- making it one of the largest private companies in the world. Koch exceeds the S&amp;P 500&#x2019;s five-decade growth by 27-fold and plans to double its value on average every six years. <br> What exactly does this company do and why is it so remarkably profitable? Koch&#x2019;s name may not be on your stain-resistant carpet, stretch denim jeans, the connectors in your smart phone, or your baby&#x2019;s ultra-absorbent diapers but it makes them all. And Koch&#x2019;s Market-Based Management� system is what drives these innovations and many more.&nbsp; <br> Based on five decades of interdisciplinary studies, experimental discovery, and practical implementation across Koch businesses worldwide, the core objective of MBM is to generate <i>good</i> profit. Good profit results from products and services that customers vote for freely with their dollars, products that improve people&#x2019;s lives.&nbsp; It results from a culture where employees are empowered to act entrepreneurially to discover customers&#x2019; preferences and the best ways to satisfy them. Good profit is what follows when <i>long-term value is created for customers, employees, shareholders, and society. </i><br> Here, drawing on revealing, honest, and previously untold stories from his nearly six decades in business, Koch walks the reader through the five dimensions of MBM to show how to apply its framework to generate more good profit in any business, industry, or organization of any size. &nbsp;Readers will learn how to:&nbsp; <br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craft a vision for how to thrive in spite of increasingly rapid disruption <br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select and retain a workforce possessing both virtue and talent <br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create an environment of knowledge sharing that prizes respectful challenges from everyone at every level <br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Award employees with ownership and decision rights based on their proven contributions, not job title<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Motivate all employees to maximize their contributions by structuring incentives so compensation is limited only by the value they create <br> &nbsp;<br> A must-read for any leader, entrepreneur, or student, as well as anyone who wants a more civil, fair, and prosperous society, <i>Good Profit</i> is destined to rank as one of the greatest management books of all time.</p><p>Charles G. Koch&nbsp;is chairman of the board and CEO of Koch Industries, Inc., a position he has held since 1967. He is renowned for building Koch Industries into the second-largest private company in the nation -- currently valued at $100 billion-- making him the fourth wealthiest man in America, according to <i>Forbes</i>.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wichita, Kansas-based Koch Industries, Inc. began as Wood River Oil and Refining Co. in 1940.

Remember that often adversity is a blessing in disguise and is certainly the greatest character builder.<br><br>&#x2014;Fred Koch1<br>You can tell the Dutch," my father would joke about himself, "but you can't tell them much." Square-jawed, determined, and persistent certainly described Fred Koch, who plunged headfirst into countless ventures--some profitable, some not. His own father, Harry, was also a risk-taker--emigrating as a teenager from the Netherlands with very little money and a head full of stories about America's "Wild West."<br><br>Whether their reputation for stubbornness is deserved or not, the Dutch emerged from Spanish rule in 1581 with a thirst for peace, tolerance, knowledge, and new ideas. During the Dutch Golden Age of the seventeenth century, they created the first stock exchange, generated the highest standard of living in the world, excelled in arts and science, and sustained a flourishing culture. The Dutch thrived thanks to freedom and a system of mutual advantage, while their less free European neighbors endured bloodshed and poverty.<br><br>Harry Koch arrived in New York as a printer's apprentice and brushed up on his English skills while working at Dutch newspapers in Michigan and Chicago. His work led him to travel down the Mississippi to Louisiana, and then to Trinity, Austin, and Galveston, Texas. In 1891 he followed the railroad to Quanah, where he bought a print shop and struggling weekly newspaper called the Chief. Quanah was in a very poor area, so many of Harry's customers paid, in part, with barter. They valued the news and advertising space his paper offered, and he valued their patronage. In an example of good profit at work, what is now the Tribune-Chief is still published today.<br><br>Harry had a thick Dutch accent and pronounced the name "Koch" with a soft, guttural "ch." The West Texan pronunciation sounded more like a crow's "caw." Years later, someone paged my father at a train station and mispronounced his name over the microphone as "Fred Coke." My father had never liked the West Texas version, so he adopted that pronunciation on the spot, thereby making a significant contribution to American phonology.<br><br>Fred played varsity football for Quanah's high school, and was an excellent orator and student. He attended the Rice Institute in Houston (an all-scholarship school at that time), where he was elected class president. Always ready to take any risk that might pay off, he transferred to MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, upon learning it had created the first-ever chemical engineering program. MIT's tuition at the time was about $300 a year. Before he moved from Texas to Boston, Fred spent the summer mopping decks on a tramp steamer--a merchant ship with no set schedule--sailing between New York and London.<br><br>Chemical engineering suited Fred Koch. His bachelor's thesis at MIT addressed environmental issues at a paper mill in Bangor, Maine, which was, coincidentally, later owned by Georgia-Pacific. (GP sold that mill but still owns the Acme gypsum plant near Quanah where my father held a summer job.) The opportunities presented by the Bangor mill--including the profitable recycling of waste products as well as energy conservation, both of which improved the environment--were important to my father and remain important to Koch, because they are mutually beneficial to our company and our communities.<br><br>At MIT, Fred, having been taught by his father to box, became captain of the boxing team. While my mother--a golfer, fly fisher, hunter, and jewelry designer--possessed excellent eye-hand coordination, Fred more than got by on his quick reflexes and competitive spirit. He encouraged all four of his sons to develop some boxing skills.<br><br>While boxing is one of my favorite Olympic sports, none of us pursued it. My brother Frederick always preferred the arts to athletics, eventually studying humanities at Harvard and drama at Yale. I had some of the most fun of my life playing rugby at MIT on a team that won two championships. My brothers David and Bill joined the MIT basketball team. David became its captain and was a small college all-American. In 1962 he set a record by scoring 41 points in one game--a record he held for forty-six years.<br><br>After college, my father got a job with Texaco (then called the Texas Company) as a research chemist at its refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. He then worked briefly as a chemical engineer for the Gasoline Products Company, a leading refinery process development firm in Kansas City.<br><br>Fred's big break as an engineer came in 1924, when his MIT classmate, Carl de Ganahl, recommended him for a job designing and constructing a refinery in England owned by de Ganahl's father, Charles. Like the Kochs, the de Ganahls had emigrated from Europe in the 1800s and eventually settled in Texas.<br><br>Charles de Ganahl was an amazing person--an outstanding entrepreneur with great integrity and compassion. His mentorship of my father, who was a twenty-four-year-old with very little business experience and even fewer connections, changed Fred's life. My father had tremendous respect for de Ganahl, so much so that he named me after him. That respect was mutual. "Fred Koch is the soundest chemical engineer in the world," de Ganahl wrote years later, "with as brilliant a pair of brain lobes as are worn by any young man of my acquaintance."2<br><br>My father gravitated toward quality people and genuinely made a good impression on them--whether it was the wealthy de Ganahl family or Sterling Varner, whose father and grandfather were oilfield mule contractors. He didn't care about social status; he treated everyone in a manner consistent with his values. It's probably a reflection of his character that good people wanted to be around him too and offered him opportunities for work.<br><br>In 1925, Fred's MIT experience, brilliant lobes, and way with people paid off again. Another former classmate, Dobie Keith, invited him to join an engineering and construction firm in Wichita, Kansas, which Keith had started with Lewis Winkler. Fred accepted, paying $300 to become an equal partner. Three months later, after Keith abruptly left to pursue another opportunity, the Winkler-Koch Engineering Company was formed.<br><br>The first two years were rough for Winkler-Koch. Because the firm lacked any proprietary technology or the capital to sell complete jobs (entailing design, equipment purchase, and construction management), small engineering fees were all Winkler-Koch could command. For a while my father was, as he put it, "dead broke" and had to sleep on a cot in the office.<br><br>Business improved in 1927 when Fred developed a better thermal cracking process for converting heavy oil into gasoline, one that was less expensive, provided higher yields, and involved less downtime than competitive processes. After a successful installation at L. B. Simmons's new Rock Island refinery in Duncan, Oklahoma, Winkler-Koch sold an average of one new installation every seven weeks for the next two years.<br><br>Winkler-Koch's success in selling this process to independent refiners inevitably caught the attention of the major oil companies, who had pooled their gasoline-making processes to control the technology. This combine, dubbed the Patent Club, charged the independents a royalty of 30 cents per barrel at a time when gasoline sold for a little over $3 per barrel (retail).<br><br>My father's new process, by contrast, was royalty-free, further enhancing its appeal to independent refiners. In 1929, the Patent Club--worried about the increased competitiveness of independents--filed forty patent infringement suits against Winkler-Koch and almost all its customers. These suits crippled the company's business in the United States and in much of Europe.<br><br>Winkler-Koch's survival as a company depended on building plants in other countries--particularly the Soviet Union, where it constructed fifteen cracking units between 1929 and 1931. As a result of that Soviet contract, Winkler-Koch enjoyed its greatest financial success during the early years of the Great Depression. Even so, Fred was very suspicious of the Soviets and demanded 90 percent payment up front.<br><br>The Soviet engineers who worked with my father confirmed his fears about doing business in the Soviet Union (and of Communism in general) when they told him about their methods and plans for world revolution. Stalin eventually purged almost all of Fred's Soviet counterparts, along with tens of millions more of his own people. My father described the Soviet Union as "a land of hunger, misery and terror." Because of his experiences there, he became a staunch anticommunist for the rest of his life--even joining the John Birch Society and encouraging me to as well. (I agreed but only stayed for a few years because I felt, like Hayek, that Communism was more of an "intellectual error" than a conspiracy that needed to be exposed.)<br><br>The Patent Club spent twenty-three years suing Winkler-Koch but was successful only once. And even that verdict was overturned after it was discovered that a judge had been bribed. This shocking behavior and the resulting scandal caused the majors to donate their process development company, Universal Oil Products, to the American Chemical Society. Winkler-Koch countersued, settling in 1952 for $1.5 million.<br><br>Despite winning, my father's advice to me was: "Never sue--the lawyers get a third, the government gets a third and you get your business destroyed." I've tried to follow his advice and have filed very few lawsuits. Unfortunately, he forgot to tell me how to keep from being sued--even by members of my own family. But more on that later.<br>The Founding of Koch Industries<br>The late 1930s brought more hard times for my father's engineering business. The Great Depression was ongoing, and the Patent Club lawsuits prevented him from reaping benefits from his thermal cracking process in the United States. So Fred stepped up his search for other business opportunities.<br><br>Once again, his good reputation served him well. Globe Oil and Refining Co. (one of the largest independent refiners and one of Winkler-Koch's best customers) decided to build a 10,000-barrel-per-day refinery on the Mississippi River near Wood River, Illinois, about fifteen miles upstream from Saint Louis.<br><br>Globe's owner, I. A. O'Shaughnessy, wanted partners to reduce the risk and bring additional capability to the venture. He first attracted Hank Ingram, owner of one of the largest barge fleets on the Mississippi, who could facilitate movement of crude oil and products in and out of the refinery. He then approached Fred to design and operate the plant.<br><br>My father agreed, on the condition of owning a substantial interest in the company. Fred paid $230,000 in 1940 for 23 percent of the Wood River Oil and Refining Co., Inc., the company that would eventually become today's Koch Industries. O'Shaughnessy and Ingram each owned 33 percent, and two Globe employees (involved in crude oil supply and product sales for Wood River) owned 5 percent each. The refinery was completed and began operating in 1941. Its owners could not have known what would come next.<br><br>World War II prompted Congress to pass four "excess profit" tax bills between 1940 and 1943, with rates ranging from 25 percent to 95 percent. As a result, during the war years, Wood River's income tax rate averaged nearly 70 percent.<br><br>This confiscatory rate did not prevent the government from pressuring Wood River to produce ever-larger quantities of high-octane aviation fuel. Also, like every other resource at the time, crude oil was difficult to obtain because of wartime shortages. No surprise, then, that conflicts arose among the primary stock-holders.<br><br>One of those conflicts was inherent in the structure of the deal: The employees of Globe Oil who supplied crude oil for its refineries and those who sold Globe's products were to also help supply and assist sales for Wood River. This caused suspicion among the non-Globe partners that Wood River wasn't receiving equal treatment. Whether this was true or not, the lesson is that whenever conflicts of interest are built into an agreement, it is unlikely to work--for long. In 1944 the Globe Oil group agreed to transfer their shares at cost to my father and Ingram to settle the differences. Fred and Ingram became equal owners as a result.<br><br>In 1946, Wood River acquired the 8,000-barrel-per-day Rock Island refinery in Duncan, Oklahoma, and its 10,000-barrel-per-day crude oil gathering system (gathering systems transport crude oil from the wellhead to a major pipeline) for $600,000, plus the right for L. B. Simmons, Rock Island's owner, to purchase a 10 percent interest in Wood River. These assets were placed in a new subsidiary named Rock Island Oil and Refining. Although the Oklahoma refinery was shut down in 1949, its gathering system became the foundation for Wood River's largest business.<br><br>Wood River lost money in 1949, prompting the sale of its Illinois refinery to Sinclair Oil for a gain of $4 million. That sale enabled a buyout of the remaining stockholders, except for my father and L. B. Simmons (who had exercised his option to buy stock). They kept the Wood River name and in early 1954 made plans to build a new refinery near Chicago, but soon gave up on the idea.<br><br>My father was smart, entrepreneurial, successful, respected, and principled. And yet he was unfailingly humble. In 1948, he wrote to a friend in Pittsburgh, "This oil business of ours has grown so big that it needs a smarter man and a better organizer to handle it."3<br><br>Fred suffered physically, not just from the high blood pressure and heart problems that would eventually take his life. In 1940, a doctor suspected a growth on my father's palate was malignant and treated it with radium needles that destroyed the roof of his mouth. After that, Fred's speech deteriorated, and eating in front of others became painfully embarrassing for him. He worried he would need a new business--one that wouldn't require much interaction with others. Ranching seemed to fit that bill.<br><br>So in 1941 he bought most of the acreage for what became Spring Creek Ranch in the Flint Hills of Kansas, where he planned to work in isolation. "It was just a dreadful experience," my mother recalled four decades later.<br><br>"He couldn't work. He couldn't do anything." My mother was a very sensitive person who took others' suffering to heart. "He lived that way and didn't complain, but he would tell me sometimes, when he couldn't stand the pain," she said.<br><br>Thankfully a gifted doctor in Saint Louis found a way to repair my father's palate, and he slowly recovered. Spring Creek then served a much happier purpose for Fred. He became fascinated by the science of ranching and would spend weekends there with all of us staying in the family cabin. Among other innovations, he helped develop the artificial salt lick, an inexpensive way to ensure cattle got sufficient salt.<br>1. Letter from Fred Koch to his sons, January 22, 1936.<br><br>2.

Gang Member</h2><p>Written in solitary confinement, Kody Scott&#x2019;s memoir of sixteen years as a gangbanger in Los Angeles was a searing best-seller and became a classic, published in ten languages, with more than 300,000 copies in print in the United States alone. After pumping eight blasts from a sawed-off shotgun at a group of rival gang members, twelve-year-old Kody Scott was initiated into the L.A. gang the Crips. He quickly matured into one of the most formidable Crip combat soldiers, earning the name Monster&#x201d; for committing acts of brutality and violence that repulsed even his fellow gang members. When the inevitable jail term confined him to a maximum-security cell, a complete political and personal transformation followed: from Monster to Sanyika Shakur, black nationalist, member of the New Afrikan Independence Movement, and crusader against the causes of gangsterism. In a document that has been compared to The Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver&#x2019;s Soul on Ice, Shakur makes palpable the despair and decay of America&#x2019;s inner cities and gives eloquent voice to one aspect of the black ghetto experience today.</p><p>Kody Scott was born in 1963 and grew up in South Central Los Angeles. In sixth grade he joined the Crips and soon earned the nom de guerre &#34;Monster&#34; for his many acts of depravity. He transformed himself into black nationalist Sanyika Shakur while in a California maximum-security prison.L&#x201a;on Bing's study of L.A. gangs, Do or Die (1991) featured on its cover an awesomely muscular African-American male, naked to the waist, wearing sunglasses and wielding an automatic weapon. That man was ``Monster'' Kody Scott, who here tells his electrifying life story: an angry, stunningly violent odyssey through gang warfare and prison to redemption. The acknowledgements page reveals Scott's continued wrath: ``Bullet-proof love is extended to Muhammad Abdullah and the Islamic Liberation Army...Teflon bullets are sent to the sell- outs.'' Scott is still fighting, only now for the New Afrikan Independence Movement, dedicated to creating a separate black nation. But, then, the author has always been at war: Drafted at age 11 into a ``set'' of the ``ghastly gang army'' of the L.A. Crips--an army of ``children gone wild in a concrete jungle''--he shot his first man, a rival Blood, that same year, and for the next 15 years led a life spent defending his set by word, fist, and bullet: ``I liked to see the buckshot eat away their clothing, almost like piranha fish.'' Much of Scott's memoir is a horrifying chronicle of gang combat--shootings, betrayals, retaliations (Scott was shot six times in one ambush)--almost tedious in its unrelenting machismo and bloodshed, made palatable mostly by the author's deep knowledge of gang lore. Eventually, jail stints punctuate the street fighting; finally, in 1983, Scott, behind bars, meets a radical Muslim who teaches him that the real battle is with the white oppressors--a lesson that takes hold in the late 80's in Folsom Prison, where, amid outrageous depravity, Scott renounces ``gangsterism'' to embrace his new struggle. Today, Scott, 29, is back in prison, serving seven years for ``a healthy beating'' he gave to an unrepentant crack dealer. A savage document of the street that gives, and asks, no quarter. Anyone who wants to know why L.A. burned will find the chilling answer here. (First printing of 65,000; first serial rights to Esquire) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

When I say car, I mean a Ford, of course, a Model T touring car, and they don&#x2019;t make them like that anymore. In those days it was a big thing to drive a car out of town, let alone a hundred miles each way of Southern Illinois dirt road. I thought the journey itself was going to be the adventure.</p><p>My dad made house calls in the Ford. He was a very well-thought-of doctor in the St. Louis of that time. A tall man with black curly hair parted in the middle and steel-rimmed spectacles gripping the bridge of his nose. He wore high celluloid collars, and I never saw him without a necktie.</p><p>I thought he carried all the wisdom of the world in the black bag that traveled to house calls with him on the front seat of the Ford. With the same silent skill that he used to set a bone, he could patch a tire.</p><p>Apparently, my dad had been young once, but I couldn&#x2019;t picture it. Even at the age of fifteen I knew but little about who he was and where he&#x2019;d come from. And so I knew but little about myself.</p><p>My dad was what they called a self-made man. Though he&#x2019;d succeeded in St. Louis, he&#x2019;d come from a little town called Grand Tower on the other side of the Mississippi River down low in Illinois.</p><p>All I knew of Dad&#x2019;s people was that they&#x2019;d lived through the Civil War. Imagine an age when there were still people around who&#x2019;d seen U. S. Grant with their own eyes, and men who&#x2019;d voted for Lincoln. People you could reach out and touch.</p><p>My dad&#x2019;s father, the first Dr. William Hutchings, had been a doctor in the Union Army. My grandmother and grandfather Hutchings still lived in what Dad called the homeplace, down in Grand Tower, that wide spot in the road.</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t remember visiting them before. My mother was very standoffish about my dad&#x2019;s side of the family. She was a St. Louis girl, and we boys were named for her side of the family. I was Howard Leland Hutchings. My little brothers, twins, were Raymond and Earl. At the age of five, they were too young to figure much in this story, but they came along on the trip too.</p><p>Dad worked a six-and-a-half-day week. It was a great occasion when he found an afternoon to take me to a Browns game. That was before the Browns forsook St. Louis to be the Baltimore Orioles.</p><p>But now he had announced that we were going to visit his folks&#x2014;motoring there and back in the Ford. It was the summer of 1916, and war was raging across Europe, the Great War. Dad said it was just a question of time before America got in it. In wartime there&#x2019;d be restrictions on travel, and so it was now or never.</p><p>The next thing I remember is the morning we left, like the dawn of creation. It was a July day breathless with St. Louis heat and the thrill of the open road unwinding before us. Our preparations had taken days. We&#x2019;d been through the toolbox time and again. We&#x2019;d filled as many cans of gasoline as we could strap to the running boards. Dad had personally filed down the points on the spark plugs. I hadn&#x2019;t slept a wink in two nights, and now the moment of leaving was upon us.</p><p>Mother wasn&#x2019;t going and didn&#x2019;t want us to go. And I didn&#x2019;t know why. I remember her up on the porch and the Ford there in the middle of Maryland Avenue. Dad and I wore dusters and caps with goggles. One of the extra features of our Ford was a windshield. But it was always laid flat across the hood for city driving. The Ford was a touring car, which meant it had a canvas pull-up roof in case of rain, or for when you spent a night on the road.</p><p>You had to crank the car a good ten minutes to get it going, and Dad left that part to me. The knack for starting a Ford was to jack up a rear wheel. He got the little boys settled on the rear seat, but they kept spilling out of the car, running back to the house for something they&#x2019;d forgotten. I wondered if we&#x2019;d ever get away.</p><p>But at last the engine caught and turned over. The Ford coughed twice and came to life. Dad broke a fresh egg into the radiator so that it would hard-boil and seal the leaks. The boys were more or less settled. Dad let out the brake and fiddled with the gas lever. We&#x2019;d already aroused the neighborhood. Now we were off in a volley of sharp reports from the tailpipe. And Mother was turning back to the house.</p><p>I ought to have kept a journal of the trip, but that&#x2019;s not the way of a fifteen-year-old boy. I remember we were hardly over on the Illinois side before Earl learned he was subject to car sickness and Raymond was hit with a great wave of homesickness. Dad had something in his black bag for Earl. He cured Raymond by saying it wasn&#x2019;t too late to take him back home and leave him behind.</p><p>Dad&#x2019;s plan was to keep the Mississippi River on our right side and try to be in the vicinity of Chester, Illinois, by nightfall. We made good time on dry roads south from Dupo and didn&#x2019;t have our first flat until very near Waterloo. In all, we did pretty well with only four flats that day, one in each tire. But it seemed like the Ford was on a jack more than it was on the road. We pumped the tires up by hand. The last sign we saw for free air was outside Columbia.</p><p>The little boys needed a steady flow of water from the bottles we&#x2019;d brought. This made for endless stops at the side of the road. This was a strictly men-only expedition, so we occasionally all four stood in a row over a ditch when the road was empty both directions. An hour of driving would pass before we&#x2019;d see another car.</p><p>We&#x2019;d pull up by open pasture and drop a ruler into the tank to gauge the gas level. The tank was set in right under the front seats, so it was like riding a bomb, though I never heard of one going off. On our stops, the boys could run wild in the field, wrestling and tussling and mauling each other like puppies. I couldn&#x2019;t remember being that age.</p><p>While we were watching them, Dad said, &#x201c;Twins run in families and tend to skip a generation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Was your dad a twin?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My mother and her brother are twins. You&#x2019;ll meet Noah. They all live together in the homeplace. My dad and mother and my aunt and uncle. People lived however they could in years past, sharing out what they had. Seemed like most of my dad&#x2019;s patients paid him in fish out of the river and vegetables out of their gardens. A doctor doesn&#x2019;t get rich in Grand Tower.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you had four parents,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;In a manner of speaking, I did.&#x201d; Dad watched the boys. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t a bad way to grow up. They taught me how to make do, and to keep my private business private. Pretty good lessons.&#x201d;</p><p>Down around Red Bud the ruts were deeper, and there was more standing water. We were getting farther into Southern Illinois, the territory they call Egypt for some reason. The farms were hardscrabble yellow clay. They plowed around trees growing clumped in the middles of fields. Two or three hills were so steep that we had to turn the Ford around and go up in reverse. So when the sun was getting down in the west, it was time to call it a day.</p><p>Two things my dad mistrusted: water from an unfamiliar well and all hotel rooms on the Illinois side of the river. He could give you a short and sweet scientific description of the common bedbug that made you happy to spend the night on the same car seat you&#x2019;d bounced along on all day.</p><p>We pulled off the road just at dusk and built a little campfire. The boys found sticks to roast wienies on. Now we were early explorers, of the Lewis and Clark party, sitting cross-legged around the wilderness fire. Dad sat just out of the glow on the running board. With any luck, we&#x2019;d be in Grand Tower tomorrow night by this time.</p><p>He must have wondered what the place would look like to us city boys who until today had thought the whole world was paved.</p><p>&#x201c;There never was a lot to Grand Tower,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;though it showed some progress after the war. When I was a boy, they had a saddle factory, a cigar plant, a gunsmith shop or two, a brick works. Enos Walker started a sawmill that peeled logs and made strips for splint baskets. My uncle Noah worked there for years.&#x201d;</p><p>The little boys&#x2019; eyes were glazing over. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s not much more than a ghost town now,&#x201d; Dad remarked.</p><p>This alerted the boys. They looked around with big eyes. The trees were black with night, and now they noticed where they were. &#x201c;A ghost town isn&#x2019;t quite the same thing as a ghost,&#x201d; Dad said. But seeing he had their full attention, he added, &#x201c;Of course, every little old town had a haunt or two.&#x201d;</p><p>From back in the trees came the rushing of some night bird&#x2019;s wings. The rusty creak of a turning windpump sounded across the darkness.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a hill over the town called the Devil&#x2019;s Backbone,&#x201d; Dad said.</p><p>Ghosts and now the devil. He had us in the palm of his hand.</p><p>&#x201c;The house where I grew up straddles the Backbone about halfway along. Now a road runs between the Backbone and the river. A ghost or something very like it has been seen crossing that road on dark nights like this.&#x201d;</p><p>I suspected Dad was playing up the story for us, but it worked on me like a charm. The boys were about in each other&#x2019;s laps.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a woman,&#x201d; Dad said, &#x201c;in old-time skirts with gray hair streaming down her back. She&#x2019;ll dart out in the road, running hard, making for the river, where she seems to throw herself in. It&#x2019;s been reported for years. Any number of horses have shied, and buggies turned over. There are people who won&#x2019;t go down that road after dark.&#x201d;</p><p>Steadying my voice, I said, &#x201c;Dad, did you ever see&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;anything?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not me.&#x201d; He stood up, working the kinks out of his back. &#x201c;You know how these old stories grow in the telling.&#x201d; But then he added, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what my mother thought. I know she didn&#x2019;t like to hear talk about that particular ghost. Too close to home, I suppose.&#x201d;</p><p>Then we were all too sleepy to make it through another moment. We pulled up the roof of the Ford and rolled the boys in car rugs to settle them on the backseat. They were joyous at turning in for the first time in their lives with dirty faces and necks. Dad drifted off, sitting bolt upright behind the wheel with his necktie in place. The rusty sound of the distant windpump turned in my dreams until daylight.</p><p>We made it to Grand Tower by the next afternoon, though we&#x2019;d overheated at Rockwood. The road nearly played out past Fountain Bluff. Then we were coming down a last hill, above the town, steeping like tea in the deep summer damp.</p><p>Above the town Dad pointed out a long, sharp-backed hill as the Devil&#x2019;s Backbone. Across the river on the Missouri side another stone outcropping rose straight out of the water. This was Tower Rock, and it gave the town its name, Dad said.</p><p>The whole heat-hazed place looked as old as the rocks it nestled among. It didn&#x2019;t seem likely to me that anybody had ever been young here.</p><p>We drove up the Backbone as near to the house as we could get. I remember it now like a moving-picture show of that time, without sound and all in black and white.</p><p>I see the little old lady on the porch with her hands in her apron. Grandma Tilly: a tiny face wrinkled like a walnut, and wisps of hair drawn back in a knot. Behind her apron she&#x2019;s slender as a girl, and there&#x2019;s something young about her. She dances with the pleasure of seeing Dad stride up the hill. To her, he&#x2019;s &#x201c;young Bill,&#x201d; we&#x2019;re young Bill&#x2019;s boys. She&#x2019;s been waiting for this moment.</p><p>Behind her in a rocker is her husband, older than she is, ancient. Waxy with age, trapped by the years and his chair, but alive behind his eyes. He has a shock of fine white hair and a curling, somehow military mustache. He wears a once-ivory alpaca suit in this stifling afternoon, and a high collar under his chins. He&#x2019;s too old to stand, but his loose-boned, veiny hand comes out to Dad, and his eyes are wet.</p><p>The camera of my memory ducks under the tin-roofed porch and enters the house as everybody did, through the kitchen door. A black iron range stands before the old open hearth. A door to the hall shows the way upstairs. There are big square bedrooms above, smelling of old times, and the old. A big chest of drawers stands in the upstairs hall. Beyond it in the best room that looks out on the river is Dad&#x2019;s aunt Delphine, in a four-poster bed.</p><p>The room hangs in lavender scent. It&#x2019;s so crowded with things, you could miss a smaller woman in the bed. But my great-aunt is very stout. Her hands, restless on the turned-back sheet, look like little pillows. Rings are embedded in her fingers. She&#x2019;s propped below a picture on the wall of a man with yellow hair in an old-fashioned costume.</p><p>She turns startling violet eyes on us. Under her beribboned bed cap, her black hair is in ringlets like a girl&#x2019;s. She has a faint mustache. When she sees my dad, her plump hands fly to her mouth, and the tears flow in dark streaks down her face.</p><p>In the moving picture memory makes, Great-uncle Noah is under the window of his wife&#x2019;s room, weeding one-handed in the heat of the day. But that can&#x2019;t be. The garden ran down from the far side of the house, and Uncle Noah would have been on the porch with his sister Tilly to greet us. He was certainly there on the day we left&#x2014;only a little bent over, in his shirtsleeves, one of them pinned up above the missing arm.</p><p>In the first moments of our visit, even the little b...</p></p><h2>Little Owl&#39;s Day</h2><p><i>Chikit-chikit-chik!</i><p><br>A squirrel is chittering.

After working on Hooked with Nir Eyal, Hoover founded Product Hunt, a company that has been described as "the place to discover the enxt big things in tech."<p>contents</p><p></p><p>introduction</p><p>Seventy-nine percent of smartphone owners check their device within fifteen minutes of waking up every morning.1 Perhaps more startling, fully one-third of Americans say they would rather give up sex than lose their cell phones.2</p><p>A 2011 university study suggested people check their phones thirty-four times per day.3 However, industry insiders believe that number is closer to an astounding 150 daily sessions.4</p><p>Face it: We&#x2019;re hooked.</p><p>The technologies we use have turned into compulsions, if not full-fledged addictions. It&#x2019;s the impulse to check a message notification. It&#x2019;s the pull to visit YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter for just a few minutes, only to find yourself still tapping and scrolling an hour later. It&#x2019;s the urge you likely feel throughout your day but hardly notice.</p><p>Cognitive psychologists define <i>habits</i> as &#x201c;automatic behaviors triggered by situational cues&#x201d;: things we do with little or no conscious thought.5 The products and services we use habitually alter our everyday behavior, just as their designers intended.6 Our actions have been engineered.</p><p>How do companies, producing little more than bits of code displayed on a screen, seemingly control users&#x2019; minds? What makes some products so habit forming?</p><p>Forming habits is imperative for the survival of many products. As infinite distractions compete for our attention, companies are learning to master novel tactics to stay relevant in users&#x2019; minds. Amassing millions of users is no longer good enough. Companies increasingly find that their economic value is a function of the strength of the habits they create. In order to win the loyalty of their users and create a product that&#x2019;s regularly used, companies must learn not only what compels users to click but also what makes them tick.</p><p>Although some companies are just waking up to this new reality, others are already cashing in. By mastering habit-forming product design, the companies profiled in this book make their goods indispensable.</p><p></p><p>FIRST TO MIND WINS</p><p>Companies that form strong user habits enjoy several benefits to their bottom line. These companies attach their product to internal triggers. As a result, users show up without any external prompting.</p><p>Instead of relying on expensive marketing, habit-forming companies link their services to the users&#x2019; daily routines and emotions.7 A habit is at work when users feel a tad bored and instantly open Twitter. They feel a pang of loneliness and before rational thought occurs, they are scrolling through their Facebook feeds. A question comes to mind and before searching their brains, they query Google. The first-to-mind solution wins. In chapter 1 of this book, we explore the competitive advantages of habit-forming products.</p><p>How do products create habits? The answer: They manufacture them. While fans of the television show Mad Men are familiar with how the ad industry once created consumer desire during Madison Avenue&#x2019;s golden era, those days are long gone. A multiscreen world of ad-wary consumers has rendered Don Draper&#x2019;s big-budget brainwashing useless to all but the biggest brands.</p><p>Today, small start-up teams can profoundly change behavior by guiding users through a series of experiences I call hooks. The more often users run through these hooks, the more likely they are to form habits.</p><p></p><p>How I Got Hooked</p><p>In 2008 I was among a team of Stanford MBAs starting a company backed by some of the brightest investors in Silicon Valley. Our mission was to build a platform for placing advertising into the booming world of online social games.</p><p>Notable companies were making hundreds of millions of dollars selling virtual cows on digital farms while advertisers were spending huge sums of money to influence people to buy whatever they were peddling. I admit I didn&#x2019;t get it at first and found myself standing at the water&#x2019;s edge wondering, &#x201c;How do they do it?&#x201d;</p><p>At the intersection of these two industries dependent on mind manipulation, I embarked upon a journey to learn how products change our actions and, at times, create compulsions. How did these companies engineer user behavior? What were the moral implications of building potentially addictive products? Most important, could the same forces that made these experiences so compelling also be used to build products to improve people&#x2019;s lives?</p><p>Where could I find the blueprints for forming habits? To my disappointment, I found no guide. Businesses skilled in behavior design guarded their secrets, and although I uncovered books, white papers, and blog posts tangentially related to the topic, there was no how-to manual for building habit-forming products.</p><p>I began documenting my observations of hundreds of companies to uncover patterns in user-experience designs and functionality. Although every business had its unique flavor, I sought to identify the commonalities behind the winners and understand what was missing among the losers.</p><p>I looked for insights from academia, drawing upon consumer psychology, human-computer interaction, and behavioral economics research. In 2011 I began sharing what I learned and started working as a consultant to a host of Silicon Valley companies, from small start-ups to Fortune 500 enterprises. Each client provided an opportunity to test my theories, draw new insights, and refine my thinking. I began blogging about what I learned at NirAndFar.com, and my essays were syndicated to other sites. Readers soon began writing in with their own observations and examples.</p><p>In the fall of 2012 Dr. Baba Shiv and I designed and taught a class at the Stanford Graduate School of Business on the science of influencing human behavior. The next year, I partnered with Dr. Steph Habif to teach a similar course at the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design.</p><p>These years of distilled research and real-world experience resulted in the creation of the Hook Model: a four-phase process companies use to forms habits.</p><p>Through consecutive Hook cycles, successful products reach their ultimate goal of unprompted user engagement, bringing users back repeatedly, without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging.</p><p>While I draw many examples from technology companies given my industry background, hooks are everywhere&#x2014;in apps, sports, movies, games, and even our jobs. Hooks can be found in virtually any experience that burrows into our minds (and often our wallets). The four steps of the Hook Model provide the framework for the chapters of this book.</p><p>The Hook Model</p><p>1. Trigger</p><p>A <i>trigger</i> is the actuator of behavior&#x2014;the spark plug in the engine. Triggers come in two types: external and internal.8 Habit-forming products start by alerting users with external triggers like an e-mail, a Web site link, or the app icon on a phone.</p><p>For example, suppose Barbra, a young woman in Pennsylvania, happens to see a photo in her Facebook News Feed taken by a family member from a rural part of the state. It&#x2019;s a lovely picture and because she is planning a trip there with her brother Johnny, the external trigger&#x2019;s call to action (in marketing and advertising lingo) intrigues her and she clicks. By cycling through successive hooks, users begin to form associations with internal triggers, which attach to existing behaviors and emotions.</p><p>When users start to automatically cue their next behavior, the new habit becomes part of their everyday routine. Over time, Barbra associates Facebook with her need for social connection. Chapter 2 explores external and internal triggers, answering the question of how product designers determine which triggers are most effective.</p><p>2. Action</p><p>Following the trigger comes the action: the behavior done in anticipation of a reward. The simple action of clicking on the interesting picture in her news feed takes Barbra to a Web site called Pinterest, a &#x201c;social bookmarking site with a virtual pinboard.&#x201d;9</p><p>This phase of the Hook, as described in chapter 3, draws upon the art and science of usability design to reveal how products drive specific user actions. Companies leverage two basic pulleys of human behavior to increase the likelihood of an action occurring: the ease of performing an action and the psychological motivation to do it.10</p><p>Once Barbra completes the simple action of clicking on the photo, she is dazzled by what she sees next.</p><p>3. Variable Reward</p><p>What distinguishes the Hook Model from a plain vanilla feedback loop is the Hook&#x2019;s ability to create a craving. Feedback loops are all around us, but predictable ones don&#x2019;t create desire. The unsurprising response of your fridge light turning on when you open the door doesn&#x2019;t drive you to keep opening it again and again. However, add some variability to the mix&#x2014;suppose a different treat magically appears in your fridge every time you open it&#x2014;and voil�, intrigue is created.</p><p>Variable rewards are one of the most powerful tools companies implement to hook users; chapter 4 explains them in further detail. Research shows that levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine surge when the brain is expecting a reward.11 Introducing variability multiplies the effect, creating a focused state, which suppresses the areas of the brain associated with judgment and reason while activating the parts associated with wanting and desire.12 Although classic examples include slot machines and lotteries, variable rewards are prevalent in many other habit-forming products.</p><p>When Barbra lands on Pinterest, not only does she see the image she intended to find, but she is also served a multitude of other glittering objects. The images are related to what she is generally interested in&#x2014;namely things to see on her upcoming trip to rural Pennsylvania&#x2014;but there are other things that catch her eye as well. The exciting juxtaposition of relevant and irrelevant, tantalizing and plain, beautiful and common, sets her brain&#x2019;s dopamine system aflutter with the promise of reward. Now she&#x2019;s spending more time on Pinterest, hunting for the next wonderful thing to find. Before she knows it, she&#x2019;s spent forty-five minutes scrolling.</p><p>Chapter 4 also explores why some people eventually lose their taste for certain experiences and how variability impacts their retention.</p><p>4. Investment</p><p>The last phase of the Hook Model is where the user does a bit of work. The investment phase increases the odds that the user will make another pass through the Hook cycle in the future. The investment occurs when the user puts something into the product of service such as time, data, effort, social capital, or money.</p><p>However, the investment phase isn&#x2019;t about users opening up their wallets and moving on with their day. Rather, the investment implies an action that improves the service for the next go-around. Inviting friends, stating preferences, building virtual assets, and learning to use new features are all investments users make to improve their experience. These commitments can be leveraged to make the trigger more engaging, the action easier, and the reward more exciting with every pass through the Hook cycle. Chapter 5 delves into how investments encourage users to cycle through successive hooks.</p><p>As Barbra enjoys endlessly scrolling through the Pinterest cornucopia, she builds a desire to keep the things that delight her. By collecting items, she gives the site data about her preferences. Soon she will follow, pin, repin, and make other investments, which serve to increase her ties to the site and prime her for future loops through the Hook.</p><p>A New Superpower</p><p>Habit-forming technology is already here, and it is being used to mold our lives. The fact that we have greater access to the web through our various connected devices&#x2014;smartphones and tablets, televisions, game consoles, and wearable technology&#x2014;gives companies far greater ability to affect our behavior.</p><p>As companies combine their increased connectivity to consumers, with the ability to collect, mine, and process customer data at faster speeds, we are faced with a future where everything becomes potentially more habit forming. As famed Silicon Valley investor Paul Graham writes, &#x201c;Unless the forms of technological progress that produced these things are subject to different laws than technological progress in general, the world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than it did in the last 40.&#x201d;13 Chapter 6 explores this new reality and discusses the morality of manipulation.</p><p>Recently, a blog reader e-mailed me, &#x201c;If it can&#x2019;t be used for evil, it&#x2019;s not a superpower.&#x201d; He&#x2019;s right. And under this definition, building habit-forming products is indeed a superpower. If used irresponsibly, bad habits can quickly degenerate into mindless, zombielike addictions.</p><p>Did you recognize Barbra and her brother Johnny from the previous example? Zombie film buffs likely did. They are characters from the classic horror flick <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>, a story about people possessed by a mysterious force, which compels their every action.14</p><p>No doubt you&#x2019;ve noticed the resurgence of the zombie genre over the past several years. Games like <i>Resident Evil</i>, television shows like <i>The Walking Dead</i>, and movies including <i>World War Z</i> are a testament to the creatures&#x2019; growing appeal. But why are zombies suddenly so fascinating? Perhaps technology&#x2019;s unstoppable progress&#x2014;ever more pervasive and persuasive&#x2014;has grabbed us in a fearful malaise at the thought of being involuntarily controlled.</p><p>Although the fear is palpable, we are like the heroes in every zombie film&#x2014;threatened but ultimately more powerful. I have come to learn that habit-forming products can do far more good than harm. Choice architecture, a concept described by famed scholars Thaler, Sunstein, and Balz in their same-titled scholarly paper, offers techniques to influence people&#x2019;s decisions and affect behavioral outcomes. Ultimately, though, the practice should be &#x201c;used to help nudge people to make better choices (as judged by themselves).&#x201d;15 Accordingly, this book teaches innovators how to build products to help people do the things they already want to do but, for lack of a solution, don&#x2019;t do.</p><p><i>Hooked</i> seeks to unleash the tremendous new powers innovators and entrepreneurs have to influence the everyday lives of billions of people. I believe the trinity of access, data, and speed presents unprecedented opportunities to create positive habits.</p><p>When harnessed correctly, technology can enhance lives through healthful behaviors that improve our relationships, make us smarter, and increase productivity.</p><p>The Hook Model explains the rationale behind the design of many successful habit-forming products and services we use daily. Although not exhaustive given the vast amount of academic literature available, the model is intended to be a practical tool (rather than a theoretical one) made for entrepreneurs and innovators who aim to use habits for good. In this book I have compiled the most relevant research, shared actionable insights, and provided a practical framework designed to increase the innovator&#x2019;s odds of success.</p><p>Hooks connect the user&#x2019;s problem with a company&#x2019;s solution frequently enough to form a habit. My goal is to provide you with a deeper understanding of ...</p></p><h2>Section 608 Certification Exam Preparatory Manual 9th Edition (EPA Section 608 Exam)</h2><p>ESCO Institute s EPA Section 608 Preparatory Manual is a valuable tool that has been prepared to help students and technicians alike prepare for their EPA Section 608 certification examination.

She lives in Oregon.1A Thousand Things Wrong<br>Cheyenne heard the car door open. She didn&#x2019;t move from where she lay curled on the backseat, her head resting on her bent arm. Despite the blanket that covered her, Cheyenne was shivering.<br>She had begged her stepmom to leave the keys in the car so she could turn on the heat if she got cold. After some back-and-forthing, Danielle had agreed. That had only been five minutes ago, and here she was, already back. Maybe the doctor had phoned in the prescription and Danielle hadn&#x2019;t had to wait for it to be filled.<br>Now the door slammed closed, the SUV rocking a little as weight settled into the driver&#x2019;s seat. The engine started. The emergency brake clunked as it was released. The car jerked into reverse.<br>It was a thousand little things that told Cheyenne something was wrong. Even the way the door closed hadn&#x2019;t sounded right. Too fast and too hard for Danielle. The breathing was all wrong too, speeded up and harsh. Cheyenne sniffed. The smell of cigarettes. But Danielle didn&#x2019;t smoke and, as a nurse, couldn&#x2019;t stand anyone who did.<br>There was no way the person driving the car was her stepmom.<br>But why would someone else have gotten in the car? It was a Cadillac Escalade, so it wasn&#x2019;t likely someone had just gotten confused and thought it was their car.<br>Then she remembered the keys. Somebody was stealing the car!<br>And Cheyenne was pretty sure they didn&#x2019;t know she was in it.<br>She froze, wondering how much the blanket covered her. She couldn&#x2019;t feel it on the top of her head.<br>Cheyenne felt like a mouse she had seen in the kitchen one time when she turned on the light before school. Caught in the middle of the floor, it had stood stock-still. Like maybe she wouldn&#x2019;t notice it if it didn&#x2019;t move.<br>But it hadn&#x2019;t worked for the mouse, and now it didn&#x2019;t work for Cheyenne. She must have made some small sound. Or maybe the thief had looked back to see if someone was following and then realized what the shape was underneath the blanket.<br>A swear word. A guy&#x2019;s voice.

Now their latest research reveals something even more surprising: Being a Challenger seller isn&#x2019;t enough. Your success or failure also depends on <i>who</i> you challenge.</b><br><br>Picture your ideal customer: friendly, eager to meet, ready to coach you through the sale and champion your products and services across the organization. It turns out that&#x2019;s the last person you need. <br><br>Most marketing and sales teams go after low-hanging fruit: buyers who are eager and have clearly articulated needs. That&#x2019;s simply human nature; it&#x2019;s much easier to build a relationship with someone who always makes time for you, engages with your content, and listens attentively. But according to brand-new CEB research&#x2014;based on data from thousands of B2B marketers, sellers, and buyers around the world&#x2014;the highest-performing teams focus their time on potential customers who are far more skeptical, far less interested in meeting, and ultimately agnostic as to who wins the deal. How could this be?<br><br>The authors of <i>The Challenger Customer</i> reveal that high-performing B2B teams grasp something that their average-performing peers don&#x2019;t: Now that big, complex deals increasingly require consensus among a wide range of players across the organization, the limiting factor is rarely the salesperson&#x2019;s inability to get an individual stakeholder to agree to a solution. More often it&#x2019;s that the stakeholders inside the company can&#x2019;t even agree with one another about what the problem is.<br><br>It turns out only a very specific type of customer stakeholder has the credibility, persuasive skill, and will to effectively challenge his or her colleagues to pursue anything more ambitious than the status quo. These customers get deals to the finish line far more often than friendlier stakeholders who seem so receptive at first. In other words, Challenger sellers do best when they target Challenger customers. <br><br><i>The Challenger Customer </i>unveils research-based tools that will help you distinguish the "Talkers" from the "Mobilizers" in any organization. It also provides a blueprint for finding them, engaging them with disruptive insight, and equipping them to effectively challenge their own organization.</p><p><b>BRENT ADAMSON</b>, coauthor of <i>The Challenger Sale</i>, is a principal executive advisor in the sales and marketing practice at CEB. <br><br><b>MATTHEW DIXON</b>, coauthor of <i>The Challenger Sale</i> and <i>The Effortless Experience</i>, is the group leader of the financial services and customer contact practices at CEB. <br><br><b>PAT SPENNER</b> is the strategic initiatives leader in the sales and marketing practice at CEB. <br><br><b>NICK TOMAN</b>, coauthor of <i>The Effortless Experience</i>, is the sales practice leader at CEB. <br><br>All four authors are frequent contributors to the <i>Harvard Business Review</i> and live in the Washington, D.C., metro area.<br><br><b>CEB</b> is the leading member-based advisory company.

So several hundred times a year in cities around the world, I introduce myself by saying &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here from Washington, D.C., to share some insights about best management practices.&#x201d;</p><p>Business cultures differ widely across regions and nations, so the response to this statement runs the gamut from &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to be sh*&amp;%ng me&#x201d; (Silicon Valley, Amsterdam) to &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, I think I misheard you&#x201d; (Singapore, Minneapolis) to &#x201c;Ah, you&#x2019;ll feel at home here after a glass of wine. Try the Super Tuscan&#x201d; (Rome). While the tone of responses varies, no one misses the irony at the heart of the statement. Like many national capitals, Washington has become a byword for organizational dysfunction. This is largely because citizens believe the U.S. Congress and similar deliberative legislative bodies that seem to take forever to act are useless, especially since when they <i>do</i> act they achieve only modest&#x2014;if any&#x2014;results.</p><p>All around the world, I routinely hear how much better off we&#x2019;d be if only government would run itself like a business. The unfortunate truth is that&#x2014;in many respects&#x2014;it already does.</p><p>More specifically, business is increasingly running itself like a dysfunctional legislative body.</p><p>I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS ABOUT SALES AND MARKETING?</p><p>You&#x2019;re now thinking that you&#x2019;ve picked up the wrong book, but the headline of our recent work on sales, marketing, and the buying process suggests that in most B2B commercial environments purchasing looks a lot like a bickering Congress or Parliament on a bad day.</p><p>That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;ve done a deep dive into the modern company&#x2019;s buying process. As we started comparing notes across companies and industries, we realized that the stories commercial leaders were sharing were eerily similar to our own experiences&#x2014;particularly when we were working with leaders to engineer dramatic innovations or step-function improvements in outcomes.</p><p>As the research team&#x2019;s work continued, my own mind kept going back to a conversation I had with the controller of a German multinational who was using our work to radically simplify and accelerate information flow through his company. I visited on a day when the project&#x2019;s kickoff (and ultimate ROI) had been delayed by <i>three months</i> due to a last-minute review requested by something called the &#x201c;excellence assurance center of excellence&#x201d; (that is not a typo).</p><p>The controller was in what could (charitably) be called a foul mood. The project itself was slated to last only six months, and he had enthusiastic support from the CEO and partnership from the CIO and head of HR. In terms of large-scale change management, he had really done everything right. And yet&#x2014;at the eleventh hour, out of nowhere&#x2014;a new stakeholder arrived on the scene, slowing down and lowering the aspiration of this fast-moving and ambitious effort. Leaning back in his chair, the CFO moaned, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t even know we had an excellence assurance COE.&#x201d;</p><p>He got up, walked toward the window, and said, &#x201c;This is a total [long German word that definitely didn&#x2019;t mean &#x201c;Really great day for our company: I just couldn&#x2019;t be prouder to work here!&#x201d;].</p><p>And it wasn&#x2019;t a great day. Nor, by the end, was it a great project. By the time the COE review was complete, the project was rescoped twice, suffered three delays, and ultimately delivered a fourth of the original business value.</p><p>When I shared this story with an HR chief of a major conglomerate, she remarked, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s ridiculous.&#x201d; I nodded, thinking she was going to share a story about how decisive she and her C-suite peers were relative to this poor controller&#x2019;s company. She continued, laughing. &#x201c;I once lost two months to our firm&#x2019;s project-naming committee. He should be happy with that outcome.&#x201d;</p><p>THE NEW REALITY FOR SALES: BIG, COMPLEX PROCESSES AND BIG, GERMAN CURSE WORDS</p><p>If it&#x2019;s this difficult for a C-level executive to drive change through an organization, just imagine how hard it is for someone on the outside to galvanize support for a disruptive new solution. The data that we analyzed points to purchase processes characterized by an ever-expanding array of stakeholders with often competing agendas, changing purchase criteria, and&#x2014;most troubling&#x2014;a reversion to lowest-common-denominator behaviors.</p><p>Why?</p><p>We see this behavior as part of a broader trend in corporate operations. Several factors are reshaping how companies operate and make decisions, and all of them have implications for sales and marketing.</p><p>First, simply put, big companies are just <i>bigger</i>. The smallest Fortune 500 company is many times the size of the smallest one just twenty years ago. And with big size comes big complexity.</p><p>Information flows are multiplying quickly. While this means more educated buyers, it also means more people in the process&#x2014;each with access to competing information and each empowered to form (and share) opinions. At its worst, information overflow can lead to <i>complete</i> decision paralysis&#x2014;bad for companies and bad for the suppliers trying to engage with them.</p><p>Professional and control functions are strengthening within companies, with many having a say in virtually every decision. This is driven partly as a result of the need for scale and consistency across larger entities and partly because of concerns about risk and regulation. Obviously from a commercial perspective, the most important of these is procurement, but procurement is only one of the folks invited to the party&#x2014;compliance, data privacy, IT security, EH&amp;S, and quality often all weigh in on major buying decisions.</p><p>Emphasis on collaborative decision making is increasing in an attempt to reap the benefits of diverse perspectives on business issues.</p><p>None of these things are bad. In fact, all are undeniably good&#x2014;bigger opportunities, more information, professional and analytic participants, and collaboration among different parties all ought to <i>strengthen</i> buying dynamics and make the process more likely to yield a successful purchase.</p><p>But all too often they don&#x2019;t. Different functions bring different agendas to the table. Excessive collaboration adds time (but not value) to the process. Information abundance buries the core issues; opportunities that initially combined strategic advantage for the buyer with strategic opportunity for the seller get watered down or abandoned altogether. In the end, if any deal is reached, it&#x2019;s for less scope and impact than what was initially proposed.</p><p>IF YOU CAN&#x2019;T BEAT &#x2019;EM, MOBILIZE &#x2019;EM</p><p>By now, I&#x2019;ve painted a pretty depressing picture of what lies ahead: slow processes, stalled deals, and customers unable to agree, settling for the lowest common denominator&#x2014;or worse still, the status quo. But, thankfully, that&#x2019;s not what&#x2019;s in store. Beyond documenting and understanding the drivers of this tough new buying environment, we also found pioneering strategies for not only surviving, but also thriving in it.</p><p>Supported by an enormous amount of research, real-world sales experience, and practical lessons from leading sales and marketing teams, this book lays out a step-by-step path anyone can follow to dramatically improve commercial performance. It&#x2019;s a path few are on today, but any company can pursue by carefully identifying and equipping a few select customer stakeholders to far more effectively mobilize the colleagues around them.</p><p>Whether you&#x2019;re in sales, marketing, service, or support&#x2014;from the front line to the corner office&#x2014;each chapter of <i>The Challenger Customer</i> provides surprising findings for rewriting the rules for how the best companies connect with current customers, dramatically boosting sales performance as a result. All designed to drive decisive action among customer organizations increasingly predisposed to systematically avoid it. I hope you read it all the way through and consider its recommendations closely. Not only will your organization thank you, but your customers will too.</p><p>TOM MONAHAN</p><p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</p><p>CEB</p><p></p><p></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>THE HARDEST PART OF SELLING SOLUTIONS</p><p>This is a book of surprises.</p><p>Chief among them is the surprising decline of historically effective selling strategies that now fail to generate anything near hoped-for returns.</p><p>Despite suppliers&#x2019; improved ability to convey their unique value, there&#x2019;s strong evidence that today&#x2019;s customers are less willing than ever before to actually <i>pay</i> for that value, even when they perceive it&#x2014;at least not when they believe the next best, less expensive alternative is &#x201c;good enough&#x201d; to meet their needs. While today&#x2019;s suppliers may win the battle for awareness, consideration, recommendation, and even preference, they still lose when it comes to what matters most: getting paid. As exasperating as it seems, the very solutions most companies developed to escape commoditization have themselves become commoditized in the eyes of their customers.</p><p>It all leaves commercial leaders wondering, &#x201c;What do we do now? What&#x2019;s left when the classic sales and marketing playbook we&#x2019;ve relied on for so many years falls short?&#x201d;</p><p>It was partly in response to these questions that CEB&#x2019;s sales and marketing practice conducted the research that led to the publication of <i>The Challenger Sale</i>&#x2014;an in-depth examination of the sales rep behaviors most likely to succeed in today&#x2019;s commercial environment. But while the debate raged around us as to whether Challenger was right or wrong, new or old, too controversial or not controversial enough, we were focused on something else entirely: What else is there?</p><p>In fact, the more research we did, the more insights we uncovered and the more convinced we became that there was a second part to this story&#x2014;one potentially more powerful than the first. It turns out, the far bigger story isn&#x2019;t about suppliers&#x2019; struggle to <i>sell </i>solutions, it&#x2019;s the customer&#x2019;s struggle to <i>buy </i>them. While there are many reasons customers fail to buy, our data shows clearly that the primary culprit is the dramatic increase in both number and diversity of customer stakeholders typically involved in solutions purchases today&#x2014;and, more damning, the severe dysfunction that is bred by the ever-expanding number of individuals who need to weigh in before a deal is signed.</p><p>In the end, what has long seemed to salespeople like a well-designed strategy to &#x201c;stick it to suppliers&#x201d; or beat them up on price is more often than not a function of a far less sinister but arguably infinitely more intractable problem: the inability of customer stakeholders <i>themselves</i> to achieve broad agreement on a common course of action in the first place. Much of the commoditization pressure suppliers face today isn&#x2019;t the result of customers&#x2019; willingness to settle for &#x201c;good enough,&#x201d; it&#x2019;s <i>their failure to agree on anything more</i>. And that&#x2019;s a challenge most sales and marketing strategies fail to solve as it&#x2019;s a problem they were never designed to address in the first place. In fact, current sales and marketing tactics <i>exacerbate</i> this problem rather than overcome it.</p><p>Of course, it&#x2019;s hard enough to <i>sell </i>effectively. How exactly are we supposed to help our customers to <i>buy </i>more effectively? Here, the research holds a final, delightful surprise: just as we learned in our previous work that it is critical to have <i>Challenger sellers</i>, our latest work shows that it is equally (if not more) critical to have <i>Challenger buyers</i>.</p><p>In a series of quantitative studies, we were able to isolate and study these individuals. These aren&#x2019;t your run-of-the-mill &#x201c;coaches&#x201d; or advocates doling out information to the sales rep and vocally championing a given supplier with colleagues. These are a special breed of customer stakeholder focused much more on marshaling the internal resources and buy-in necessary to compel their colleagues to collectively think and act beyond the status quo, <i>irrespective</i> of supplier. As we&#x2019;ve studied these individuals in a great deal of depth, what we&#x2019;ve found is: in a world of diverse and potentially dysfunctional customer stakeholders, it&#x2019;s not just <i>that</i> you challenge, but <i>who</i> you challenge that really matters. To win today, you need a Challenger <i>inside</i> the customer organization.</p><p>These customer Challengers exist and can be found&#x2014;but only if suppliers are looking for them in the first place.

Visit Peter at PeterHReynolds.com.It&#x2019;s a happy day in Mrs. Chanda&#x2019;s classroom when the students are given identical kits for constructing go-carts to race in a contest. Rafael, who is good at following directions, and his classmate Maya, a dreamer with a practical bent, creatively combine their kits to build a small plane. On contest day, a classmate scoffs at their contraption, but Maya and Rafael&#x2019;s vehicle soars above the go-carts to win the race. The closing spread offers a preview of their next project: a frog-inspired amphibious craft. Pared down to essentials, the text reads aloud well. In the artwork, the settings and expressive characters are defined by bold, black lines. Most illustrations are bright with colors, though the occasional picture, such as a night scene showing the children silhouetted against the sky, uses black, white, and shades of purplish gray.

Anthony was also the first British winner of the Hans Christian Andersen Award, one of the highest international honours for illustration. His work has been widely exhibited and his books are published all over the world.</p>Browne again proves himself an artist of inventive voice and vision as he creates perhaps his most psychologically complex work to date via a commonplace experienceAa brief sojourn to a city park. The author of King Kong and the Willy stories again features anthropomorphic chimps, who provide four unique perspectives: an uppity, overbearing mother and her glum son, Charles; and an unemployed fellow and his cheerful daughter, Smudge. What transpires factually is simple: the two children play together, their dogs do the same, the adults keep to themselves. Yet Browne reinvents and overlays the scene as each parent and child in turn describes their version of the events, altering light, colors and words. Browne sets up the tension by starting off with Charles's stylishly dressed mother, who lets her "pedigree Labrador," Victoria, off the leash and then scoffs at "some scruffy mongrel"(Smudge's dog). The matriarch similarly describes Charles's newfound friend as "a very rough-looking child." Through Charles's eyes, readers watch the tops of lampposts, gray clouds and a leafless tree take on the shape of his mother's large chapeau, as her hat-dominated figure casts a shadow over the boy. In the succeeding page, Browne cleverly frames a shift in Charles's mood with an illustration divided by a lamppost: threatening clouds and bare trees give way to blue skies and blossoming branches when a smiling, pigtailed (anything but rough-looking) Smudge on the sunny side of the park bench invites Charles to play on the slide. Browne offers readers much to pore over. His images reflect the human psyche; some are eerie (Edvard Munch's "The Scream" appears in the want ads; a burning tree provides the backdrop for mother and son's silent exit from the park), others uplifting. For example, the subjects of two portraits leaning on the park wall, a gloomy Rembrandt self-portrait and a weeping Mona Lisa, transform into a dancing couple under a street lamp fashioned from a flower, as the jobless man departs the park, cheered by his daughter. Although some discomfiting tonesAin both pictures and textA appear in the vignettes, Browne also celebrates the redeeming power of connecting with another human being. His creativity invites youngsters to tap into their own, as they look for clues between the trees and add their own spins to Browne's four interconnected tales.

For generations, the Burroughs clan has made its home on Bull Mountain in North Georgia, running shine, pot, and meth over six state lines, virtually untouched by the rule of law. To distance himself from his family&#x2019;s criminal empire, Clayton took the job of sheriff in a neighboring community to keep what peace he can. But when a federal agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms shows up at Clayton&#x2019;s office with a plan to shut down the mountain, his hidden agenda will pit brother against brother, test loyalties, and could lead Clayton down a path to self-destruction.<br><br>In a sweeping narrative spanning decades and told from alternating points of view, the novel brilliantly evokes the atmosphere of the mountain and its inhabitants: forbidding, loyal, gritty, and ruthless. A story of family&#x2014;the lengths men will go to protect it, honor it, or in some cases destroy it&#x2014;<i>Bull Mountain</i> is an incredibly assured debut that heralds a major new talent in fiction.<br><b><br>&#x201c;Panowich stamps words on the page as if they&#x2019;ve been blasted from the barrel of a shotgun, and as with a shotgun blast, no one is safe from the scattered fragments of history that impale the people of Bull Mountain.&#x201d;&#x2014;Wiley Cash,<i>&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i></i>-bestselling author of&nbsp;<i><i>This Dark Road to Mercy</i></i></b></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of July 2015:</strong> Brian Panowich&#x2019;s debut novel, <em>Bull Mountain</em>, is a dark and deeply seductive addition to the best of Southern fiction. Through multiple narrators, readers are exposed to successive generations of the Burroughs clan and the mountain in the Georgia backwoods that they consider theirs. An outlaw attitude with brutal rules about right and wrong, where wrong can make you dead, is passed on from father to son until the present generation that somehow includes one son who joins the law. The family&#x2019;s land has provided an illegal income dating from the time of running moonshine to the meth labs of 2015, and while violent and harsh there is a simplicity to their way of being in the world that is hard to look away from. <em>Bull Mountain</em> is an intense and expertly told multigenerational story of blood ties, and bonds stronger than kinship, how the sins of fathers are borne by their sons, and what happens when someone down the line wants redemption--or revenge. <em>--Seira Wilson</em></p>2<b>Brian Panowich</b> is an award winning author, a Georgia firefighter, and a father to four incredible children.

The supporting characters are rich in voice and context, with multiple villains and friends that achingly reveal life in America in the 1990s for persons of color and those living in poverty. Heavy themes, including extortion, fraud, and racism, are balanced with the na�ve dreams and determination of a 10-year-old.... With bittersweet information on Chinese immigration to America added in an author's note, this book captures many important themes to explore individually or in the classroom. Many readers will recognize themselves or their neighbors in these pages." -- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, starred review<br><br>* "Mia herself is an irresistible protagonist, and it is a pleasure to see both her writing and her power grow through a series of letters that she sends to remedy injustices. The hefty and satisfying dose of wish fulfillment that closes the story feels fully earned by the specificity and detailed warmth of Yang's setup. Many young readers will see themselves in Mia and her friends.... A swiftly moving plot and a winsome protagonist make this a first purchase for any collection, especially where realistic fiction is in demand." -- <i>School Library Journal</i>, starred review<br><br>* "It's the details that sing in this novel, particularly the small moments that feel like everything when you're a kid...This book will help foster empathy for the immigrant experience for young readers, while for immigrant children, it is a much-needed and validating mirror....Deserving of shelf space in every classroom and library." -- <i>Booklist</i>, starred review<br><br>"Reminiscent of the television series Fresh Off the Boat, this title is an honest account of the ups and downs of immigrant life in America in the early 1990s, here told from a child's perspective. Basing the story on her own childhood experiences, Yang writes Mia's dreams into reality without sacrificing or minimizing the heartbreaking realities of many immigrants' hardships. Resilient Mia stumbles over and over again, but she satisfyingly picks herself right back up, often with the help of her parents, Calivista family, and friends. The question of whether Mia will win the essay contest is a big one, but whether or not the answer is yes, there is much satisfaction in this book's powerful and heart-wrenching close." -- <i>Bulletin for the Center of Children's Books</i>, starred review<br><br>"<i>Front Desk</i> is a story about the hardships of immigrant life, the perpetuation of injustice, and a sweet, kind, indomitable young girl who chooses to rise up and fight no matter how hard it gets.

He can do a great high five and remains a modest fellow despite the glory that has been heaped upon him.</p><p>Chapter 1</p> <p>Fellow Travellers</p> <p>There&#x2019;s an old adage I read somewhere. It says each of us is given second chances every day of our lives. They are there for the taking, it&#x2019;s just that we don&#x2019;t usually take them.</p> <p>I spent a significant chunk of my life proving how true those words are. I was given a lot of opportunities, sometimes on a daily basis. For a long time I failed to take any of them, but then, in the early spring of 2007, that finally began to change. It was then that I befriended Bob. Looking back on it, something tells me it might have been his second chance too.</p> <p>I first encountered him on a gloomy, Thursday evening in March. London hadn&#x2019;t quite shaken off the winter and it was still bitingly cold on the streets, especially when the winds blew in off the Thames. There had even been a hint of frost in the air that night, which was why I&#x2019;d arrived back at my new, sheltered accommodation in Tottenham, north London, a little earlier than usual after a day busking around Covent Garden.</p> <p>As normal, I had my black guitar case and rucksack slung over my shoulders but this evening I also had my closest friend, Belle, with me. We&#x2019;d gone out together years ago but were just mates now. We were going to eat a cheap takeaway curry and watch a movie on the small black and white television set I&#x2019;d managed to find in a charity shop round the corner.</p> <p>As usual, the lift in the apartment block wasn&#x2019;t working so we headed for the first flight of stairs, resigned to making the long trudge up to the fifth floor.</p> <p>The strip lighting in the hallway was broken and part of the ground floor was swathed in darkness, but as we made our way to the stairwell I couldn&#x2019;t help noticing a pair of glowing eyes in the gloom. When I heard a gentle, slightly plaintive meowing I realised what it was.</p> <p>Edging closer, in the half-light I could see a ginger cat curled up on a doormat outside one of the ground-floor flats in the corridor that led off the hallway.</p> <p>I&#x2019;d grown up with cats and had always had a bit of a soft spot for them. As I moved in and got a good look I could tell he was a tom, a male.</p> <p>I hadn&#x2019;t seen him around the flats before, but even in the darkness I could tell there was something about him, I could already tell that he had something of a personality. He wasn&#x2019;t in the slightest bit nervous, in fact, completely the opposite. There was a quiet, unflappable confidence about him. He looked like he was very much at home here in the shadows and to judge by the way he was fixing me with a steady, curious, intelligent stare, I was the one who was straying into his territory. It was as if he was saying: &#x2018;So who are you and what brings you here?&#x2019;</p> <p>I couldn&#x2019;t resist kneeling down and introducing myself.</p> <p>&#x2018;Hello, mate. I&#x2019;ve not seen you before, do you live here?&#x2019; I said.</p> <p>He just looked at me with the same studious, slightly aloof expression, as if he was still weighing me up.</p> <p>I decided to stroke his neck, partly to make friends but partly to see if he was wearing a collar or any form of identification. It was hard to tell in the dark, but I realised there was nothing, which immediately suggested to me that he was a stray. London had more than its fair share of those.</p> <p>He seemed to be enjoying the affection, and began brushing himself lightly against me. As I petted him a little more, I could feel that his coat was in poor condition, with uneven bald patches here and there. He was clearly in need of a good meal. From the way he was rubbing against me, he was also in need of a bit of TLC.</p> <p>&#x2018;Poor chap, I think he&#x2019;s a stray. He&#x2019;s not got a collar and he&#x2019;s really thin,&#x2019; I said, looking up at Belle, who was waiting patiently by the foot of the stairs.</p> <p>She knew I had a weakness for cats.</p> <p>&#x2018;No, James, you can&#x2019;t have him,&#x2019; she said, nodding towards the door of the flat that the cat was sitting outside. &#x2018;He can&#x2019;t have just wandered in here and settled on this spot, he must belong to whoever lives there. Probably waiting for them to come home and let him in.&#x2019;</p> <p>Reluctantly, I agreed with her. I couldn&#x2019;t just pick up a cat and take him home with me, even if all the signs pointed to the fact it was homeless. I&#x2019;d barely moved into this place myself and was still trying to sort out my flat. What if it did belong to the person living in that flat? They weren&#x2019;t going to take too kindly to someone carrying off their pet, were they?</p> <p>Besides, the last thing I needed right now was the extra responsibility of a cat. I was a failed musician and recovering drug addict living a hand-to-mouth existence in sheltered accommodation. Taking responsibility for myself was hard enough.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>The following morning, Friday, I headed downstairs to find the ginger tom still sitting there. It was as if he hadn&#x2019;t shifted from the same spot in the past twelve hours or so.</p> <p>Once again I dropped down on one knee and stroked him. Once again it was obvious that he loved it. He was purring away, appreciating the attention he was getting. He hadn&#x2019;t learned to trust me 100 per cent yet. But I could tell he thought I was OK.</p> <p>In the daylight I could see that he was a gorgeous creature. He had a really striking face with amazingly piercing green eyes, although, looking closer, I could tell that he must have been in a fight or an accident because there were scratches on his face and legs. As I&#x2019;d guessed the previous evening, his coat was in very poor condition. It was very thin and wiry in places with at least half a dozen bald patches where you could see the skin. I was now feeling genuinely concerned about him, but again I told myself that I had more than enough to worry about getting myself straightened out. So, more than a little reluctantly, I headed off to catch the bus from Tottenham to central London and Covent Garden where I was going to once more try and earn a few quid busking.</p> <p>By the time I got back that night it was pretty late, almost ten o&#x2019;clock. I immediately headed for the corridor where I&#x2019;d seen the ginger tom but there was no sign of him. Part of me was disappointed. I&#x2019;d taken a bit of a shine to him. But mostly I felt relieved. I assumed he must have been let in by his owner when they&#x2019;d got back from wherever it was they had been.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>My heart sank a bit when I went down again the next day and saw him back in the same position again. By now he was slightly more vulnerable and dishevelled than before. He looked cold and hungry and he was shaking a little.</p> <p>&#x2018;Still here then,&#x2019; I said, stroking him. &#x2018;Not looking so good today.&#x2019;</p> <p>I decided that this had gone on for long enough.</p> <p>So I knocked on the door of the flat. I felt I had to say something. If this was their pet, it was no way to treat him. He needed something to eat and drink &#x2013; and maybe even some medical attention.</p> <p>A guy appeared at the door. He was unshaven, wearing a T-shirt and a pair of tracksuit bottoms and looked like he&#x2019;d been sleeping even though it was the middle of the afternoon.</p> <p>&#x2018;Sorry to bother you, mate. Is this your cat?&#x2019; I asked him.</p> <p>For a second he looked at me as if I was slightly mad.</p> <p>&#x2018;What cat?&#x2019; he said, before looking down and seeing the ginger tom curled up in a ball on the doormat.</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh. No,&#x2019; he said, with a disinterested shrug. &#x2018;Nothing to do with me, mate.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;He&#x2019;s been there for days,&#x2019; I said, again drawing a blank look.</p> <p>&#x2018;Has he? Must have smelled cooking or something. Well, as I say, nothing to do with me.&#x2019;</p> <p>He then slammed the door shut.</p> <p>I made my mind up immediately.</p> <p>&#x2018;OK, mate, you are coming with me,&#x2019; I said, digging into my rucksack for the box of biscuits I carried specifically to give treats to the cats and dogs that regularly approached me when I was busking.</p> <p>I rattled it at him and he was immediately up on all fours, following me.</p> <p>I could see he was a bit uneasy on his feet and was carrying one of his back legs in an awkward manner, so we took our time climbing the five flights of stairs. A few minutes later we were safely ensconced in my flat.</p> <p>My flat was threadbare, it&#x2019;s fair to say. Apart from the telly, all I had in there was a second-hand sofa bed, a mattress in the corner of the small bedroom, and in the kitchen area a half-working refrigerator, a microwave, a kettle and a toaster. There was no cooker. The only other things in the flat were my books, videos and knick-knacks.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m a bit of a magpie; I collect all sorts of stuff from the street. At that time I had a broken parking meter in one corner, and a broken mannequin with a cowboy hat on its head in another. A friend once called my place &#x2018;the old curiosity shop&#x2019;, but as he sussed out his new environment the only thing the tom was curious about was the kitchen.</p> <p>I fished out some milk from the fridge, poured it into a saucer and mixed it with a bit of water. I know that &#x2212; contrary to popular opinion &#x2212; milk can be bad for cats because, in fact, they are actually lactose intolerant. He lapped it up in seconds.</p> <p>I had a bit of tuna in the fridge so I mixed it up with some mashed up biscuits and gave that to him as well. Again, he wolfed it down. Poor thing, he must be absolutely starving, I thought to myself.</p> <p>After the cold and dark of the corridor, the flat was five-star luxury as far as the tom was concerned. He seemed very pleased to be there and after being fed in the kitchen he headed for the living room where he curled up on the floor, near the radiator.</p> <p>As I sat and watched him more carefully, there was no doubt in my mind that there was something wrong with his leg. Sure enough, when I sat on the floor next to him and started examining him I found that he had a big abscess on the back of his rear right leg. The wound was the size of a large, canine-like tooth, which gave me a good idea how he&#x2019;d got it. He&#x2019;d probably been attacked by a dog, or possibly a fox, that had stuck its teeth into his leg and clung on to him as he&#x2019;d tried to escape. He also had a lot of scratches, one on his face not far from his eye, and others on his coat and legs.</p> <p>I sterilised the wound as best as I could by putting him in the bathtub then putting some non-alcoholic moisturiser around the wound and some Vaseline on the wound itself. A lot of cats would have created havoc if I&#x2019;d tried to treat them like that but he was as good as gold.</p> <p>He spent most of the rest of the day curled up on what was already his favourite spot, near the radiator. But he also roamed around the flat a bit every now and again, jumping up and scratching at whatever he could find. Having ignored it earlier on, he now began to find the mannequin in the corner a bit of a magnet. I didn&#x2019;t mind. He could do whatever he liked to it.</p> <p>I knew ginger toms could be very lively and could tell he had a lot of pent-up energy. When I went to stroke him, he jumped up and started pawing at me. At one point he got quite animated, scratching furiously and almost cutting my hand</p> <p>&#x2018;OK, mate, calm down,&#x2019; I said, lifting him off me and putting him down on the floor. I knew that young males who hadn&#x2019;t been neutered could become extremely lively. My guess was that he was still &#x2018;complete&#x2019; and was well into puberty. I couldn&#x2019;t be sure, of course, but it again underlined the nagging feeling that he must have come off the streets rather than from a home.</p> <p>I spent the evening watching television, the tom curled up by the radiator, seemingly content to be there. He only moved when I went to bed, picking himself up and following me into the bedroom where he wrapped himself up into a ball by my feet at the edge of the bed.</p> <p>As I listened to his gentle purring in the dark, it felt good to have him there. He was company, I guess. I&#x2019;d not had a lot of that lately.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>On Sunday morning I got up reasonably early and decided to hit the streets to see if I could find his owner. I figured that someone might have stuck up a &#x2018;Lost Cat&#x2019; poster. There was almost always a photocopied appeal for the return of a missing pet plastered on local lampposts, noticeboards and even bus stops. There seemed to be so many missing moggies that there were times when I wondered whether there was a cat-napping gang at work in the area.</p> <p>Just in case I found the owner quickly, I took the cat with me, attaching him to a leash I&#x2019;d made out of a shoelace to keep him safe. He was happy to walk by my side as we took the stairs to the ground floor.</p> <p>Outside the block of flats the cat began pulling on the string lead as if he wanted to head off. I guessed that he wanted to do his business. Sure enough he headed off into a patch of greenery and bushes adjoining a neighbouring building and disappeared for a minute or two to heed nature&#x2019;s call. He then returned to me and happily slipped back into the lead.</p> <p>He must really trust me, I thought to myself. I immediately felt that I had to repay that trust and try and help him out.</p> <p>My first port of call was the lady who lived across the street. She was known locally for looking after cats. She fed the neighbourhood strays and got them neutered, if necessary. When she opened the door I saw at least five cats living inside. Goodness knows how many more she had out the back. It seemed that every cat for miles headed to her backyard knowing it was the best place to get some food. I didn&#x2019;t know how she could afford to feed them all.</p> <p>She saw the tom and took a shine to him straight away, offering him a little treat.</p> <p>She was a lovely lady but didn&#x2019;t know anything about where he&#x2019;d come from. She&#x2019;d not seen him around the area.</p> <p>&#x2018;I bet he&#x2019;s come from somewhere else in London. Wouldn&#x2019;t surprise me if he&#x2019;s been dumped,&#x2019; she said. She said she&#x2019;d keep her eyes and ears open in case she heard anything.</p> <p>I had a feeling she was right about him being from somewhere far from Tottenham.</p> <p>Out of interest, I took the cat off his lead to see if he knew what direction to go in. But as we walked the streets, it was obvious he didn&#x2019;t know where he was. He seemed completely lost. He looked at me as if to say: &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know where I am; I want to stay with you.&#x2019;</p> <p>We were out for a few hours. At one point he scurried off into a bush to do his business again, leaving me to ask any passing locals whether they recognised him. All I got was blank looks and shrugs.</p> <p>It was obvious that he didn&#x2019;t want to leave me. As we wandered around, I couldn&#x2019;t help wondering about his story: where he&#x2019;d come from and what sort of life he&#x2019;d led before he&#x2019;d come and sat on the mat downstairs.</p> <p>Part of me was convinced that the &#x2018;cat lady&#x2019; across the street was right and he was a family pet. He was a fine-looking cat and had probably been bought for Christmas or someone&#x2019;s birthday. Gingers can be a bit mental and worse if not neutered, as I&#x2019;d already seen. They can get very dominant, much more so than other cats. My hunch was that when he&#x2019;d become boisterous and frisky he had also become a little too much to handle.</p> <p>I imagined the parents saying &#x2018;enough is enough&#x2019; and &#x2212; rather than taking him to a refuge or the RSPCA &#x2212; sticking him in the back of the family car, taking him for a drive and throwing him out into the street or on to the roadside.</p> <p>Cats have a great sense of direction, but he&#x2019;d obviously been let loose far from home and hadn&#x2019;t gone back. Or maybe he&#x2019;d known that it wasn&#x2019;t really home at all and decided to find a new one.</p> <p>My other theory was that he&#x2019;d belonged to an old person who had passed away.</p> <p>Of course, it was possible that wasn&#x2019;t the case at all. The fact that he wasn&#x2019;t house-trained was the main argument against him having been domesticate...</p></p><h2>In Bloom: A Step-by-Step Guide to Drawing Lush Florals</h2><p><b>From the author of adult-coloring sensations <i>Botanical Wonderland</i> and <i>Desert Wonderland</i>, as well as the bestselling <i>Color Workshop</i>, comes a stunning guide to drawing a garden full of flowers.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Rachel Reinert is the perfect artist to explain the intricacies of drawing flowers.

We had to walk the elephants early, because it couldn&#x2019;t be done during normal theme-park hours. The elephants were walked through the park, and tourists would just get in the way.<br> <br>In the wild, elephants walk a lot. They&#x2019;ve been known to cover more than fifty miles in a day, although the average is around twenty. They&#x2019;re built for walking (they&#x2019;re the only animal with four knees), but even at a massive, state-of-the-art place like FunJungle Wild Animal Park, there couldn&#x2019;t be an exhibit big enough to let them roam that far. So, in the interest of keeping the elephants fit and happy, the staff walked them in the morning, the same way normal people walked their dogs&#x2014;only, the pooper-scoopers were a lot bigger.<br> <br>I wasn&#x2019;t really supposed to be walking the elephants because I was only twelve years old. Any animal that weighs eight tons and is capable of lifting a small car can be dangerous. But since I was the only kid who lived at FunJungle, I&#x2019;d gotten to know lots of the keepers well, so they cut me some slack&#x2014;as long as I kept a safe distance and one of my parents came with me.<br> <br>That was easy to arrange. My father was always happy to bring me. As a professional wildlife photographer, he didn&#x2019;t mind getting up early; that was the best time to take pictures of animals in the wild. Plus, being with the elephants reminded him of life back in Africa. My mother was a famous primatologist, and before my folks had been hired by FunJungle, we&#x2019;d spent ten years in a tent camp in the Congo while Mom studied chimpanzees. We&#x2019;d all loved it, but a war had forced us to give up that life. Living in a trailer park behind the world&#x2019;s biggest zoo was probably as close to the African experience as we could get, but it still wasn&#x2019;t quite the same.<br> <br>For starters, it was really cold that morning. The temperature in the Congo had rarely dropped below seventy degrees, while winters in central Texas could be bone-chilling. I had never even owned a sweater in Africa; Now I was wrapped in a ski jacket with three layers underneath. Our breath clouded the air in front of us, while steam rose off the elephants&#x2019; warm bodies.<br> <br>The elephants didn&#x2019;t seem bothered by the cold, though. The whole herd was there, twelve elephants ranging in age from two to sixty. Eleanor, the matriarch, was in the lead, while the younger mothers and their offspring followed. (The park&#x2019;s only breeding male, Tembo, had to be kept apart and did his walks late at night.)<br> <br>It took five keepers to control the elephants. Two flanked the herd on either side, gently directing them along Adventure Road, the park&#x2019;s main concourse. The keepers were all armed with brooms with the bristles wrapped in towels, which looked kind of like giant Q-tips. These were used to gently prod the elephants along, or to nudge them back into line should they veer off and try to eat an expensive piece of landscaping.<br> <br>Bonnie Melton, the head keeper, brought up the rear. Bonnie had forty years of experience in zoos and knew more about elephants than almost anyone on earth. She was wrinkled as a prune&#x2014;caring for elephants meant you spent a lot of time in the sun&#x2014;but she had the enthusiasm of a kindergartener. While none of her subordinate keepers seemed pleased to be working so early, Bonnie was chipper as could be, even though she had an industrial-size pooper-scooper slung over her shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s school going, Teddy?&#x201d; she asked me, as we led the herd past the front gates.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pretty good,&#x201d; I replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;You making friends okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, I guess.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You guess?&#x201d; Dad repeated, then put an arm around me proudly. &#x201c;Ever since Teddy knocked out the school bully, he&#x2019;s the most popular kid there.&#x201d;<br> <br>Despite the freezing temperatures, I could feel my face grow warm with embarrassment. &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m not, Dad.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The head cheerleader came over for a date,&#x201d; Dad told Bonnie.<br> <br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t a date,&#x201d; I corrected. &#x201c;She only wanted to see FunJungle behind the scenes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sounds like a date to me,&#x201d; Bonnie said, stifling a smile.<br> <br>I tried to change the subject. &#x201c;If anyone&#x2019;s the most popular kid in my school, it&#x2019;s Summer McCracken.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bonnie nodded knowingly. &#x201c;She would be.&#x201d;<br> <br>Summer McCracken was the daughter of J.J. McCracken, the local billionaire who&#x2019;d sunk a good deal of his fortune into building FunJungle. Summer was only a year older than me, and she was the first friend I&#x2019;d made in Texas. Until recently, she&#x2019;d attended prep school on the East Coast, but she&#x2019;d asked to come home&#x2014;so now she was the newest student at Lyndon B. Johnson Middle School.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is that why she transferred from that fancy-schmancy school?&#x201d; Bonnie asked. &#x201c;So she could be belle of the ball here?&#x201d;<br> <br>I shrugged. &#x201c;Summer said life was more exciting here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bonnie laughed. &#x201c;Here? We&#x2019;re thirty miles from the nearest city.&#x201d; She suddenly turned and yelled, &#x201c;Kwame! Don&#x2019;t eat that!&#x201d;<br> <br>Kwame, a three-year-old elephant, sheepishly unwound his trunk from an oleander bush like a kid who&#x2019;d been caught with his hand in the cookie jar.<br> <br>&#x201c;There has been some excitement here,&#x201d; Dad pointed out. &#x201c;A murdered hippo. A stolen koala. An escaped tiger. Those kinds of things don&#x2019;t happen too often at prep school.&#x201d;<br> <br>At that moment, Eleanor Elephant lifted her tail and deposited a large pile of poop on the concourse.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh yeah,&#x201d; Bonnie said. &#x201c;This place is a thrill a minute.&#x201d; Then she hoisted the pooper-scooper off her shoulder and hurried off to clean up after Eleanor.<br> <br>According to Summer, poop had always been J.J. McCracken&#x2019;s biggest concern about letting the elephants walk around the park in the morning. &#x201c;Oh sure, he&#x2019;ll say he&#x2019;s worried about safety,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d told me, &#x201c;but really, it&#x2019;s the poo. He&#x2019;s terrified the keepers will somehow overlook a big old elephant poop one morning and that some poor guest will step in it.&#x201d;<br> <br>I could understand J.J.&#x2019;s concern. Elephants make nearly two hundred pounds of poop a day&#x2014;as well as enough pee to fill a bathtub. A janitorial team armed with industrial-strength cleansers had to follow the elephant parade around the park every morning. To that end, J.J. had looked for an alternative way to exercise the elephants&#x2014;and had even considered building jumbo-size treadmills at one point. Nothing had panned out, though, so for the time being, the elephants were still walking.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet that cheerleader thought it was a date,&#x201d; Dad said.<br> <br>I turned away from the elephants and looked at him, surprised. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She spent over four hours with you,&#x201d; Dad told me. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think she would have done that unless she liked you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Or she likes animals.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s her name again?&#x201d; Dad asked. &#x201c;Daisy?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Violet,&#x201d; I corrected. &#x201c;Violet Grace.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You should ask Violet to the movies sometime.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; I looked back toward Bonnie. I would have rather watched a person clean up elephant poop than have this conversation.<br> <br>Dad wouldn&#x2019;t let it go, though. I got the sense this was a talk he&#x2019;d been wanting to have for a long time. &#x201c;Why not? She&#x2019;s the head cheerleader and she likes you. Back when I was in middle school, I prayed that would happen to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t want to ask her&#x2014;that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d; Normally, I didn&#x2019;t like the idea of lying to my father, but at the same time, I didn&#x2019;t feel like telling him the real reason I didn&#x2019;t want to ask Violet out.<br> <br>However, Dad was savvier than I realized. &#x201c;Is this about Summer?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>I turned back to him, caught off guard. But before I could answer&#x2014;or figure out how not to answer&#x2014;Athmani Okeke came along.<br> <br>Athmani was a wildlife security specialist from Kruger National Park in South Africa, where he&#x2019;d worked to protect the animals from poachers. FunJungle had been open only six months, but already its hippo mascot had been murdered and a popular koala bear had been stolen, so J.J. McCracken had decided his animal security needed to be greatly improved. He&#x2019;d hired Athmani as a consultant right after New Year&#x2019;s, and Athmani had been working so feverishly since then, he&#x2019;d barely left the property. He was wearing a camouflage uniform from Kruger, because he still hadn&#x2019;t made it to town to buy any new clothes yet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good morning, gentlemen!&#x201d; he called, waving to both of us. Athmani spoke with a lilt in his voice, the way many native Africans did, which made his words sound a bit like a song. His skin was so dark that the whites of his eyes seemed to glow against it. &#x201c;What brings you out here so early this morning?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Getting a little exercise.&#x201d; Dad shook Athmani&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;How about yourself?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m making sure my elephants are safe.&#x201d; Athmani held up his hand to me for a fist bump. Fist bumps were new to him, and he seemed to find them amusing.<br> <br>I knocked my knuckles against his. &#x201c;Do you think they&#x2019;re in danger?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, they&#x2019;re not while I&#x2019;m around.&#x201d; Athmani grinned, but it didn&#x2019;t last long. &#x201c;To be honest, I&#x2019;m not crazy about them walking around the park like this. Lots of things could go wrong.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got them under control,&#x201d; Bonnie said, trotting back over. Her pooper-scooper was considerably heavier and smellier now, though neither she nor Athmani seemed bothered by the stink. Their years around the elephants had made them immune. &#x201c;And they love the exercise. They can&#x2019;t just sit in their exhibit all day.&#x201d;<br> <br>Athmani frowned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not that crazy about their exhibit either. I have concerns about security in that part of the park.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Like what?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>Before Athmani could answer me, a rifle shot rang out. It sounded like it was coming from close by, loud and clear, shattering the morning quiet.<br> <br>I know what a rifle sounds like. There were lots of hunters in that part of Texas. Our trailer sat right on the edge of the woods, and I&#x2019;d heard plenty of rifle shots from there.<br> <br>But I&#x2019;d never heard one this close to FunJungle before.<br> <br>Dad, Bonnie, and the rest of the keepers instantly went on alert. So did all the animals. By now we were close to Monkey Mountain, and the air was suddenly filled with startled whoops and cries from the primates. Elsewhere, birds squawked, zebras brayed, and big cats roared.<br> <br>But the elephants responded most dramatically of all.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s not a myth that elephants never forget. They have tremendous memories, particularly of emotional moments. Eleanor had been born in the wild and orphaned by poachers. When the rifle sounded nearby, she panicked. She trumpeted loudly and ran, leading her herd toward safety. The other elephants dutifully followed. They veered away from their keepers, off Adventure Road, stampeding in the opposite direction from the gunshot.<br> <br>Unfortunately, Dad and I were right in their path.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look out!&#x201d; Dad yelled, as though maybe I hadn&#x2019;t noticed twelve elephants bearing down on me and trumpeting at the top of their lungs. He grabbed my arm to drag me away, though I was already moving.<br> <br>An elephant can run twenty-five miles an hour. Dad and I dove out of the way just in time. The herd thundered past us, then plowed right through some decorative landscaping. A group of topiary animals was flattened into mulch within seconds. One of the bigger females sideswiped a large oak tree, which toppled as though it had been hit by a truck, crushing a souvenir kiosk.<br> <br>&#x201c;Eleanor, stop!&#x201d; Bonnie shouted, but her words were drowned out by the ruckus the elephants were making. Bonnie and the other keepers ran after the herd, but keeping up with it was hopeless. The elephants were too fast, and to make matters worse, they&#x2014;like most animals&#x2014;responded to fear by emptying their bladders.<br> <br>The evolutionary reason animals (and in many cases, humans) do this is that it&#x2019;s hard to run with a full bladder. Plus, all that pee and poop weighs quite a lot&#x2014;especially when you&#x2019;re an elephant&#x2014;and when you&#x2019;re fleeing for your life, every last bit of weight you can leave behind helps. Within seconds, the ground was a minefield of elephant poo, with an ocean of pee around it. Understandably, the keepers were in no hurry to run through it.<br> <br>Ahead of them, the panicked elephants stampeded onward&#x2014;even though the Gorilla Grill, one of the most popular restaurants at FunJungle, sat right in their way. In the wild, there&#x2019;s not much that elephants can&#x2019;t plow through, except for the occasional baobab tree, so when they&#x2019;re on the run, they tend to go in a straight line, flattening anything in their path.<br> <br>The restaurant was no match for them. The front of it was floor-to-ceiling windows. The herd smashed right through them, shattering the glass and splintering the support beams, then stormed through the dining area, crushing tables and chairs as though they were made of paper. They crashed through the far wall, trampled the outdoor furniture, and raced off toward Monkey Mountain.<br> <br>I picked myself up off the ground and surveyed the wreckage. The restaurant was totaled. The service counter had been pounded into toothpicks. The grills had been upended and jets of flame flared from where the gas lines had snapped. Geysers of soda erupted from the previous site of the soft-drink dispenser. Then, with a shriek of rending wood, the roof caved in.<br> <br>Bonnie and the other keepers kept after the herd, desperately yelling commands at them as though they were Labrador retrievers. &#x201c;Stop! Stay! Bad elephants! Bad elephants!&#x201d;<br> <br>My father and Athmani both looked extremely concerned&#x2014;although they weren&#x2019;t watching the elephants. In fact, neither seemed to be aware the restaurant had collapsed. They were staring off in the opposite direction, the way the rifle shot had come from. Both started running that way.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; I called, chasing after them. &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t we help with the elephants?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bonnie will get them under control,&#x201d; Dad told me. &#x201c;Right now I&#x2019;m more worried about whoever fired that shot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t think it was only a hunter?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Dad said. &#x201c;Whoever fired that gun was too close to FunJungle. I don&#x2019;t think they were going after deer or rabbits.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You mean . . . ?&#x201d; I began.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Dad looked back at me, and I could see the worry in his eyes. &#x201c;I think someone just tried to kill one of our animals.&#x201d;</p><h2>Elantris: Tenth Anniversary Author&#39;s Definitive Edition</h2><p><p><b>In 2005, Brandon Sanderson debuted with <i>Elantris</i>, an epic fantasy unlike any other then on the market.

The closer he got to the projects, the more tension he felt, his body almost vibrating from the strain by the time he took a right into what most cops considered a war zone. As the Atlanta Housing Authority slowly devoured itself, subsidized communities like Grady were becoming a thing of the past. The in-town real estate was too valuable, the potential for kickback too high. Right up the road was the city of Decatur, with its trendy restaurants and million-dollar houses. Less than a mile in the other direction was Georgia&#x2019;s gold-encrusted capitol dome. Grady was like a worse-case scenario sitting between them, a living reminder that the city too busy to hate was also too busy to take care of its own.<br><br> With the game on, the streets were fairly empty. The drug dealers and pimps were taking the night off to watch that rarest of miracles occur: the Atlanta Falcons playing in the Super Bowl. This being a Sunday night, the prostitutes were still out making a living, trying to give the churchgoers something to confess next week. Some of the girls waved at Michael as he drove past, and he returned the greeting, wondering how many unmarked cars stopped here during the middle of the night, cops telling Dispatch they were taking a ten-minute break, then motioning over one of the girls to help blow off some steam.<br><br> Building nine was in the back of the development, the crumbling red brick edifice tagged by the Ratz, one of the new gangs that had moved into the Homes. Four cruisers and another unmarked car were in front of the building, lights rolling, radios squawking. Parked in the residents&#x2019; spaces were a black BMW and a pimped out Lincoln Navigator, its ten-thousand-dollar razor rims glittering gold in the streetlights. Michael fought the urge to jerk the steering wheel, take some paint off the seventy-thousand-dollar SUV. It pissed him off to see the expensive cars the bangers drove. In the last month, Michael&#x2019;s kid had shot up about four inches, outgrowing all his jeans, but new clothes would have to wait for Michael&#x2019;s next paycheck. Tim looked like he was waiting for a high tide while Daddy&#x2019;s tax dollars went to help these thugs pay their rent.<br><br> Instead of getting out of his car, Michael waited, listening to another few seconds of the game, enjoying a moment&#x2019;s peace before his world turned upside down. He had been on the force for almost fifteen years now, going straight from the army to the police, realizing too late that other than the haircut, there wasn&#x2019;t that much difference between the two. He knew that as soon as he got out of his car it would all start up like a clock that was wound too tight. The sleepless nights, the endless leads that never panned out, the bosses breathing down his neck. The press would probably catch on to it, too. Then he&#x2019;d have cameras stuck in his face every time he left the squad, people asking him why the case wasn&#x2019;t solved, his son seeing it on the news and asking Daddy why people were so mad at him.<br><br> Collier, a young beat cop with biceps so thick with muscle he couldn&#x2019;t put his arms down flat against his sides, tapped on the glass, gesturing for Michael to roll down his window. Collier had made a circling motion with his meaty hand, even though the kid had probably never been in a car with crank windows.<br><br> Michael pressed the button on the console, saying, &#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; as the glass slid down.<br><br> &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s winning?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not Atlanta,&#x201d; Michael told him, and Collier nodded as if he had expected the news. Atlanta&#x2019;s previous trip to the Super Bowl was several years back. Denver had thumped them 34&#x2013;19.<br><br> Collier asked, &#x201c;How&#x2019;s Ken?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s Ken,&#x201d; Michael answered, not offering an elaboration on his partner&#x2019;s health.<br><br> &#x201c;Could use him on this.&#x201d; The patrolman jerked his head toward the building. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s pretty nasty.&#x201d;<br><br> Michael kept his own counsel. The kid was in his early twenties, probably living in his mother&#x2019;s basement, thinking he was a man because he strapped on a gun every day. Michael had met several Colliers in the Iraqi desert when the first Bush had decided to go in. They were all eager pups with that glint in their eye that told you they had joined up for more than three squares and a free education. They were obsessed with duty and honor, all that shit they&#x2019;d seen on TV and been fed by the recruiters who plucked them out of high school like ripe cherries. They had been promised technical training and home-side base assignments, anything that would get them to sign on the dotted line. Most of them ended up being shipped off on the first transport plane to the desert, where they got shot before they could put their helmets on.<br><br> Ted Greer came out of the building, tugging at his tie like he needed air. The lieutenant was pasty for a black man, spending most of his time behind his desk basking in the fluorescent lights as he waited for his retirement to kick in.<br><br> He saw Michael still sitting in the car and scowled. &#x201c;You working tonight or just out for a drive?&#x201d;<br><br> Michael took his time getting out, sliding the key out of the ignition just as the halftime commentary started on the radio. The evening was warm for February, and the air-conditioning units people had stuck in their windows buzzed like bees around a hive.<br><br> Greer barked at Collier, &#x201c;You got something to do?&#x201d;<br><br> Collier had the sense to leave, tucking his chin to his chest like he&#x2019;d been popped on the nose.<br><br> &#x201c;Fucking mess,&#x201d; Greer told Michael. He took out his handkerchief and wiped the sweat off his forehead. &#x201c;Some kind of sick perv got ahold of her.&#x201d;<br><br> Michael had heard as much when he&#x2019;d gotten the call that pulled him off his living-room couch. &#x201c;Where is she?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Six flights up.&#x201d; Greer folded the handkerchief into a neat square and tucked it into his pocket. &#x201c;We traced the nine-one-one call to that phone.&#x201d; He pointed across the street.<br><br> Michael stared at the phone booth, a relic of the past. Everybody had cell phones now, especially dealers and bangers.<br><br> &#x201c;Woman&#x2019;s voice,&#x201d; Greer told him. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have the tape sometime tomorrow.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How long did it take to get somebody out here?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Thirty-two minutes,&#x201d; Greer told him, and Michael&#x2019;s only surprise was that it hadn&#x2019;t taken longer. According to a local news team investigation, response times to emergency calls from Grady averaged around forty-five minutes. An ambulance took even longer.<br><br> Greer turned back to the building as if it could absolve him. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re gonna have to call in some help on this one.&#x201d;<br><br> Michael bristled at the suggestion. Statistically, Atlanta was one of the most violent cities in America. A dead hooker was hardly an earth-shattering development, especially considering where she was found.<br><br> He told Greer, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all I need is more assholes telling me how to do my job.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;This asshole thinks it&#x2019;s exactly what you need,&#x201d; the lieutenant countered. Michael knew better than to argue&#x2014;not because Greer wouldn&#x2019;t tolerate insubordination, but because he&#x2019;d agree with Michael just to shut him up, then turn around and do whatever the hell he wanted to anyway.<br><br> Greer added, &#x201c;This one&#x2019;s bad.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re all bad,&#x201d; Michael reminded him, opening the back door to his car and taking out his suit jacket.<br><br> &#x201c;Girl didn&#x2019;t have a chance,&#x201d; Greer continued. &#x201c;Beat, cut, fucked six ways to Sunday. We got a real sick fuck on our hands.&#x201d;<br><br> Michael put on his jacket, thinking Greer sounded like he was auditioning for HBO. &#x201c;Ken&#x2019;s out of the hospital. Said come by and see him anytime.&#x201d;<br><br> Greer made some noises about being real busy lately before trotting off toward his car, looking back over his shoulder as if he was afraid Michael would follow. Michael waited until his boss was in his car and pulling out of the lot before he headed toward the building.<br><br> Collier stood at the doorway, hand resting on the butt of his gun. He probably thought he was keeping watch, but Michael knew that the person who had committed this crime wasn&#x2019;t going to come back for more. He was finished with the woman. There was nothing else he wanted to do.<br><br> Collier said, &#x201c;The boss left fast.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Thanks for the news flash.&#x201d;<br><br> Michael braced himself as he opened the door, letting the damp, dark building slowly draw him in. Whoever had designed the Homes hadn&#x2019;t been thinking about happy kids coming home from school to warm cookies and milk. They had focused on security, keeping open spaces to a minimum and covering all the light fixtures in steel mesh to protect the bulbs. The walls were exposed concrete with narrow windows tucked into tight little corners, the safety wire embedded in the glass looking like uniform cobwebs. Spray paint covered surfaces that had been painted white once upon a time. Gang tags, warnings and various pieces of information covered them now. To the right of the front door, someone had scrawled, <i>Kim is a ho! Kim is a ho! Kim is a ho</i>!<br><br> Michael was looking up the winding staircase, counting the six flights, when a door creaked open. He turned to find an ancient black woman staring at him, her coal dark eyes peering out around the edge of the steel door.<br><br> &#x201c;Police,&#x201d; he said, holding up his badge. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be afraid.&#x201d;<br><br> The door opened wider. She was wearing a floral apron over a stained white T-shirt and jeans. &#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t afraid&#x2019;a you, bitch.&#x201d;<br><br> Clustered behind her were four old women, all but one of them African-American. Michael knew they weren&#x2019;t here to help. Grady, like any small community, thrived on gossip and these were the mouths that fed the supply line.<br><br> Still, he had to ask, &#x201c;Any of y&#x2019;all see anything?&#x201d;<br><br> They shook their heads in unison, bobbleheads on the Grady dashboard.<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s great,&#x201d; Michael said, tucking his badge back into his pocket as he headed toward the stairs. &#x201c;Thanks for helping keep your community safe.&#x201d;<br><br> She snapped, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s your job, cocksucker.&#x201d;<br><br> He stopped, his foot still on the bottom stair as he turned back toward her, looking her straight in the eye. She returned the glare, rheumy eyes shifting back and forth like she was reading the book of his life. The woman was younger than the others, probably in her early seventies, but somehow grayer and smaller than her companions. Spidery lines crinkled the skin around her lips, wrinkles etched from years of sucking on cigarettes. A shock of gray streaked through the hair on the top of her head as well as the ones corkscrewing out of her chin like dreadlocks. She wore the most startling shade of orange lipstick he had ever seen on a woman.<br><br> He asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br><br> Her chin tilted up in defiance, but she told him, &#x201c;Nora.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Somebody made a nine-one-one call from that phone booth outside.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I hope they wash they hands after.&#x201d;<br><br> Michael allowed a smile. &#x201c;Did you know her?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We all knowed her.&#x201d; Her tone indicated there was a lot more to be told but she wasn&#x2019;t the one who was going to tell it to some dumb-ass white cop. Obviously, Nora didn&#x2019;t exactly have a college degree under her belt, but Michael had never set much store by that kind of thing. He could tell from her eyes that the woman was sharp. She obviously had street smarts. You didn&#x2019;t live to be that old in a place like Grady by being stupid.<br><br> Michael took his foot off the step, walking back toward the cluster of women. &#x201c;She working?&#x201d;<br><br> Nora kept her eye on him, still wary. &#x201c;Most nights.&#x201d;<br><br> The white woman behind her provided, &#x201c;She an honest girl.&#x201d;<br><br> Nora tsked her tongue. &#x201c;Such a young little thing.&#x201d; There was a hint of challenge in her voice when she said, &#x201c;No kind of life for her, but what else could she do?&#x201d;<br><br> Michael nodded like he understood. &#x201c;Did she have any regulars?&#x201d;<br><br> They all shook their heads, and Nora provided, &#x201c;She never brought her work home with her.&#x201d;<br><br> Michael waited, wondering if they would add anything else. He counted the seconds off in his head, thinking he&#x2019;d let it go to twenty. A helicopter flew over the building and car wheels squealed against asphalt a couple of streets over, but no one paid attention. This was the sort of neighborhood where people got nervous if they didn&#x2019;t hear gunshots at least a couple of times a week. There was a natural order to their lives, and violence&#x2014;or the threat of it&#x2014;was as much a part of it as fast food and cheap liquor.<br><br> &#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Michael said, having counted the seconds to twenty-five. He took out one of his business cards, handing it to Nora as he told her, &#x201c;Something to wipe your ass on.&#x201d;<br><br> She grunted in disgust, holding the card between her thumb and forefinger. &#x201c;My ass is bigger than that.&#x201d;<br><br> He gave her a suggestive wink, made his voice a growl. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think I hadn&#x2019;t noticed, darlin&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br><br> She barked a laugh as she slammed the door in his face. She had kept the card, though. He had to take that as a positive sign.<br><br> Michael walked back to the stairs, taking the first flight two at a time. All of the buildings at Grady had elevators, but even the ones that worked were dangerous. As a first-year patrolman, Michael had been called out to the Homes on a domestic disturbance and gotten caught in one of the creaky contraptions with a busted radio. He had spent about two hours trying not to add to the overwhelming smell of piss and vomit before his sergeant realized he hadn&#x2019;t reported in and sent somebody to look for him. The old-timers had laughed at his stupidity for another half hour before helping get him out.<br><br> Welcome to the brotherhood.<br><br> As Michael started on the second flight of stairs, he felt a change in the air. The smell hit him first: the usual odor of fried foods mingled with beer and sweat, cut by the sudden but unmistakable stench of violent death.<br><br> The building had responded to the fatality in the usual way. Instead of the constant thump of rap beating from multiple speakers, Michael heard only the murmur of voices from behind closed doors. Televisions were turned down low, the halftime show serving as background noise while people talked about the girl on the sixth floor and thanked the Lord it was her this time and not their children, their daughters, themselves.<br><br> In this relative quiet, sounds started to echo down the stairwell: the familiar rhythms of a crime scene as evidence was gathered, photos taken. Michael stopped at the bottom of the fourth-floor landing to catch his breath. He had given up smoking two months ago but his lungs hadn&#x2019;t really believed him. He felt like an asthmatic as he made his way up the next flight of stairs. Above him, someone barked a laugh, and he could hear the other cops join in, participating in the usual bullshit bravado that made it possible for them to do the job.<br><br> Downstairs, a door slammed open, and Michael leaned over the railing, watching two women wrangle a gurney inside the foyer. They were wearing dark blue rain jackets, bright yellow letters announcing &#x201c;MORGUE&#x201d; on their backs.<br><br> Michael called, &#x201c;Up here.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How far up?&#x201d; one of them asked.<br><br> &#x201c;Sixth floor.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Mother fuck,&#x201d; she cursed.<br><br> Michael grabbed the handrail and pulled himself up the next few stairs, hearing the two women offer up more expletives as they started the climb, the gurney banging against the metal railings like a broken bell. He was one flight away from the top when he felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. Sweat had glued his shirt to his back, but some sort of sixth sense sent a chill through him.<br><br> A flash popped and a camera whirred. Michael stepped carefully around a red stiletto shoe that was flat on the stair, l...</p><h2>The Rust Programming Language (Covers Rust 2018)</h2><p><b>The official book on the Rust programming language, written by the Rust development team at the Mozilla Foundation, fully updated for Rust 2018.</b><br><br>The Rust Programming Language is the official, definitive guide to Rust, a hugely popular, community-supported programming language.

He lives in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, at historic Cedaridge Farm, where he cultivates an award-winning garden of flowers, fruits, and vegetables.What Is a Vertical Garden?<br><br>CHAPTER 1<br><br>I'd like to welcome you to a garden where vegetables, flowers, and fruit all grow, climb, and twine upward to create a beautiful landscape that saves space, requires less effort, produces high yields, and reduces pest and disease problems. Whether your goal is armloads of flowers, a bountiful vegetable garden, or a productive fruit harvest, I'll show you how narrow strips of soil, bare walls, and simple trellises and arches can be transformed into grow-up or grow-down gardens with just a few inexpensive supplies or purchased planters. I've been testing gardening methods in my own 20-acre garden at Cedaridge Farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, for 20 years, and I want you to discover the same delights and benefits of vertical gardening that I'm enjoying.<br><br>Vertical gardening is an innovative, effortless, and highly productive growing system that uses bottom-up and top-down supports for a wide variety of plants in both small and large garden spaces. There are hundreds of varieties of vegetables, fruits, and flowers that are perfect for growing up freestanding and wall-mounted supports and in beds or containers.<br><br>Best of all, vertical gardening guarantees a better result from the day your trowel hits your soil--by shrinking the amount of garden space needed and reducing the work needed to prepare new beds. Chores like weeding, watering, fertilizing, and controlling pests and diseases are reduced considerably, while yields are increased, especially with vegetables like beans and tomatoes. A vining pole bean will outyield a bush bean tenfold. Moreover, a vining vegetable is capable of continuous yields--the more you pick, the more the plant forms new flowers and fruit to prolong the harvest. A bush variety, by contrast, will exhaust itself within 2 to 3 weeks.<br><br>A Japanese wisteria vine twines upward through the canopy of this small- scale replica of Monet's bridge. The long flower clusters offer an intimate and fragrant resting spot while viewing the water garden at Cedaridge Farm.<br><br>With vertical gardening methods, you'll also discover that many ground- level plants pair beautifully with climbing plants, so you can combine different types of plants to create a lush curtain of flowers, foliage, and bounty. With a mix of do-it-yourself and commercially available string supports, trellises, pergolas, raised beds, Skyscraper Garden trellises, and Topsy-Turvy planters, vertical gardening saves a lot of time and work, lessens backbreaking tasks, makes harvesting easier, and is perfect for any size space, from a patio container and a 1 x 4-foot strip of soil to a landscape trellis and the entire side of a building.<br><br>LAYING THE GROUNDWORK<br><br>I first encountered a successful no-dig garden at the Good Gardeners Association in Hertfordshire, England. I visited the home of the group's founder, the late Dr. W. E. Shewell-Cooper, in 1970, when I went to interview him for an article in Horticulture magazine. On my return to the United States, I also discovered The Ruth Stout No-Work Garden Book, which was one of the first books that advocated a system of no-dig gardening through in situ (in place) composting. Stout explained how she created planting beds by putting down newspapers to suffocate existing weeds and grass; piling on layers of organic waste, such as spoiled hay and kitchen scraps, as mulch to decompose; and then planting directly into this compost. This system of gardening has appealed to many people during the past 40 years, even though its focus has been gardening horizontally.<br><br>Many no-dig plots based on Ruth Stout's book have been established in public demonstration gardens, including one maintained by the ECHO Foundation (Educational Concerns for Hunger Organization) near Fort Myers, Florida. The foundation began its first no-dig garden in 1981, which remained in continuous production for years as a vegetable garden in the middle of what had been a lawn. It was never plowed, cultivated, spaded, or hoed. Around the same time, engineer-turned-author Mel Bartholomew introduced his own concept in his book Square Foot Gardening, which promoted raised beds and intensively planted crops that allowed gardeners to grow more in less space. Mel has convinced millions of gardeners around the world to switch to easy no-dig raised beds. And then along came Patricia Lanza with her blockbuster book Lasagna Gardening. After struggling to amend the soil in her gardens, she, too, realized that layering compostable ingredients was the best way to start new garden beds, and she's been growing flowers, vegetables, and herbs for years in her "lasagna" layers.<br><br>For the past couple of decades, I've studied, tried, and implemented gardening systems that produce better results in less space with less work. Many no-dig methods were developed specifically for gardening horizontally, but I've found that these same no-dig techniques are even better suited to vertical gardening. With vertical gardening, plants require much less space than plants that grow horizontally, so those same layering techniques are even more efficient when used in conjunction with the small-footprint beds I recommend. While most no-dig systems suggest that a 6-inch depth of fertile soil is adequate, I prefer a soil depth of 6 to 12 inches in a raised planting bed, because vining plants generally have more vigorous root systems than dwarf plants or plants grown horizontally. Plants grown in 6 to 12 inches of fertile soil respond magnificently to that extra soil depth by delivering maximum yields.<br><br>THE BENEFITS OF GROWING VERTICALLY<br><br>If you've gardened in long, horizontal beds for even a single growing season, you've probably thought to yourself, "There has to be a better way." Well, you're right--there is a better way. Vertical gardening offers many advantages over horizontal growing.<br><br>Smaller beds to prepare and maintain. When growing plants with a vertical habit, you'll need a bed only as large as the root systems of those plants-- one that's much smaller than a traditional bed. When you plant horizontally, you tend to have narrow rows of plants and wide swaths of soil between them. It's those wide swaths that drink up much of the water, send up innumerable weeds, and consume the nutrients needed by your plants. With vertical gardening, you prepare only small spots or strips of fertile soil--just enough to give plants a nutritious base from which to climb up supports. These vertical garden beds require less compost, fertilizer, and water, and only a few bucketfuls of mulch or a little black plastic to control weeds. Compost goes further when you cut back on bed space, so you won't need to buy, generate, or use as much compost in order to amend your soil each season. And whether you plan to water with a watering can or use a drip irrigation system, you'll find that watering your small plots of soil is a cinch, and your drip hose can be short.<br><br>A simple vertical garden is perfect for a paved or soil surface, 2 feet wide x 4 feet long, with room for four vining plants such as a tomato, cucumber, climbing spinach, and pole bean.<br><br>I'm an advocate of no-dig beds, because I've seen the results others have achieved, in addition to my own successes. You can easily create a no-dig bed by spreading homemade or store-bought compost onto bare soil--or onto a layer of newspapers to kill surface weeds or turfgrass--and leveling the new bed with a rake. Spreading compostable layers on top of your newspaper weed barrier will create a fluffy, nutrient-rich planting bed (the method called in situ or sheet composting).<br><br>To compost in situ, I make sure my newspaper layer is at least 15 pages thick and that the edges overlap like the scales of a fish. This excludes light from the ground beneath, killing grass and weeds. On top of this, I generally place a 6-inch layer of grass clippings, a 6-inch layer of shredded leaves (I use a lawn mower to shred them), and then a layer of kitchen waste (often including banana peels, eggshells, fish bones, and potato skins). This stack is then topped off by a 1/2-inch layer of wood ashes. Other good composting ingredients include well-rotted animal manure (like cow and horse), sawdust, shredded newspapers, pine needles, and hay. Hold the sides of this in-situ compost bed in place with boards, landscape ties, or even stones or bricks.<br><br>Skyscraper structures can be assembled above a raised bed to create a freestanding unit, ready for edible vines such as pole beans and indeterminate tomatoes or flowering vines such as morning glories and climbing nasturtiums.<br><br>Do-it-yourself supports and trellises. While vertical gardening depends on a variety of supports and trellises, you'll find that it's easy to make your own. I make many of my own trellises from bamboo canes that I grow myself, or from pencil-straight pussy willow stems. It's simple to take canes or willow stakes and space them 1 foot apart to make posts, and use thinner, more pliable canes threaded through them horizontally to make strong, good-looking trellises. You'll see lots of examples of homemade trellises in the photographs in this book. Of course, ready-made trellises are available from garden centers, large hardware stores, and even big-box discount stores. Sturdy metal ones are suited for heavier vines, like melons and winter squash. In this book, you'll also discover the Skyscraper Garden trellis, a post-and-netting support I designed specifically for growing vegetables and flowers vertically. Skyscraper Garden trellises can be freestanding or wall-mounted and can be grouped in raised beds to create an efficient, highly productive, and attractive gardening space.<br><br>At Cedaridge Farm, I've created long raised beds and use Skyscraper Garden trellises to support vining crops above low-growing foundation vegetables and herbs.<br><br>Vertical pots and containers for very small spaces. If you don't have any (or much) garden space--say, just a concrete patio or a balcony--or if you can't easily amend your soil or build a raised bed, then consider using tower pots or other containers that help you grow upward in a column. Tower pots are commercial containers that stack one on top of the other and enable you to grow vertically a variety of plants that don't vine (such as lettuce, peppers, and strawberries). Plus, you can easily add trellises and supports within containers or "planted" just behind containers to create a vertical garden in a limited space. And if you need to be really creative with garden space, try mounting containers at various heights on a fence or wall to create a visual vertical garden.<br><br>New plant varieties to explore. The choices of climbing plants may surprise you. Among the vegetables, try growing climbing spinach (it's heat resistant and tastes even better than the regular cool season spinach), trellis-loving snap peas with edible pods, and the fabulous climbing 'Trombone' zucchini that produces a vine 10 feet tall and loaded with fruits. All of these grow up, not out. Vining cucumbers, single-serving vining melons, and even sweet potato vines are all suitable for growing upward, instead of sprawling outward across the ground and consuming more space than you can easily care for during the season. And if you've ever grown vegetable spaghetti (also known as spaghetti squash) in a traditional garden, try growing it up a trellis instead: Allowed to grow across the ground, vegetable spaghetti is an aggressive vine that will suffocate anything in its path; but when it's grown up a trellis, it shoots skyward with tendrils that grasp latticework or garden netting, producing up to a dozen fruit on a vine.<br><br>On this shady fence, wooden buckets are mounted at various heights with strong metal brackets and feature lush plantings of fuchsia and impatiens for an appealing vertical flower garden.<br><br>You may even find that vertically grown vegetables taste better. Bear in mind that all that vine foliage collects more chlorophyll than a bush variety of the same vegetable, and this may help to promote better flavor. It is said that the French Impressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir had such a refined taste for good food (his wife, Aline, earned a reputation as one of the finest cooks in France) that he could tell the difference between snap beans grown on poles and those grown on dwarf, bushy plants, because to him the vertically grown beans had superior flavor. Based on my own experience, I agree with him! Of course, the king of vegetables--the tomato--benefits from growing vertically, especially those varieties classified as indeterminate (with vines that can reach 20 feet or more) in seed catalogs and on plant labels. When you look at world-record harvests for tomatoes, all of the winning plants were staked to grow vertically, with some growing more than 25 feet high, producing hundreds of fruit from early summer to fall frost.<br><br>You can try many new plant varieties in your vertical garden. Using a strong trellis or a bamboo support and heavy-gauge garden netting, experiment with the edible gourd 'Cuccuzi'; long, straight fruits develop when the fruit is allowed to hang.<br><br>One of the bigger benefits of vertical gardening is being able to grow many different fruits against a wall or along wires or a split-rail fence. Of course, vining fruits like grapes and hardy kiwifruit are ideal, but so are berry crops with long, flexible canes like blackberries and raspberries. Even fruit trees with strong, sturdy trunks have pliable side branches that can be trained to grow flat for long distances against a wall or fence. This practice, known as espalier, significantly reduces the amount of space needed for a generous harvest of apples, peaches, pears, and other orchard trees--and reducing the growing space footprint is one of the tenets of vertical gardening. Be aware that many fruit trees are sold in standard, semi-dwarf, and dwarf sizes, referring to the mature height of the tree. For espalier in a home garden, the semi-dwarf and dwarf are most suitable, producing full-size fruit regardless of the extent of dwarfing.<br><br>Flowering vines also tend to be everblooming and provide armloads of flowers for cutting. Sweet peas, nasturtiums, and morning glories will produce curtains of color planted in a short row to climb up garden netting (either attached to a sunny wall or strung between posts as a freestanding trellis). Grow all three together for an incredible kaleidoscope of color. Then explore the dozens of other choices of upwardly mobile and cascading flowers and vines to create a garden that's filled with interesting "living walls," dividers, and curtains of foliage.

The typed recipes and instructions are a direct translation of the handwriting seen in the photographs on each page. To preserve its authenticity, no extra instructions have been added. The cover is a photograph of the actual book (with title added.) Bring your tablet into the rural English kitchen of 1910. Relive the tastes and smells of an age where there were no microwave ovens or digital scales. Back then, cooking was done on a Yorkshire Range. The book was compiled before the First World War when young women visited each other&#39;s houses swapping recipes, as well as catching up on the latest gossip. Funny little markings on some of the recipes, ( a cross &#34;X&#34; with a dot between each line ) was a star rating, four dots being the best. The recipes included instructions like &#34;place the chocolate and sugar into a bowl and warm by the fire, stirring until melted&#34; ( you will probably pop them into a microwave for a few seconds ) The hand written recipes contain simple ingredients available at that time. Self raising flour was not in common use, baking powder was used with plain flour. UK measurements are used; oz, lbs. and pints. Gills and quarts are given as mL and fluid ozs. Also terms like &#34;bake in a quick oven&#34; are used, a handy guide to all modern settings is given on the &#34;Conversions&#34; page. This is not a book for the complete novice. You won&#39;t find any &#34;preheat the oven to 200� &#34; instructions. Their skills were not only in baking, but also maintaining the oven at a constant temperature, remember the heat came from the coal and wood, no thermostatic controls or glass fronted oven in doors existed back then. However, if you can bake scones and know by looking at things when they are &#34;done,&#34; you will enjoy experimenting as they did, adapting the recipes to your own taste. Above all......enjoy the taste of yesteryear !!</p><p></p><h2>National Geographic Readers: Pyramids (Level 1)</h2><p>Travel to ancient Egypt to learn all about its amazing pyramids in this new National Geographic Kids Reader.

For generations, France had been besieged by the British. At age 11, Joan began to see religious visions telling her to join forces with the King of France. By the time she was a teenager, she was leading troops into battle in the name of her country. Though she was captured and executed for her beliefs, Joan of Arc became a Catholic saint and has since captured the world&#39;s imagination.</p><p>Pamela Pollack and Meg Belviso are authors of several books in this series, including <i>Who Is George Lucas?</i>, <i>Who Was Alfred Hitchcock?</i> and <i>Who Was Susan B. Anthony?</i><b>Who Was Joan of Arc?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> English soldiers surrounded the great walls of Orl�ans (say: OR-lee-on), France. The people had been trapped inside the town without food for seven months. The English hoped that if they closed off the city long enough, the French citizens would open their gates and surrender.<br> &nbsp;<br> France and England had been at war for as long as the people of Orl�ans could remember. The Duke of Orl�ans, the town&#x2019;s leader, had already been captured by the English. His half brother, John de Dunois, did his best to defend the town. But he couldn&#x2019;t drive the English away. The people of Orl�ans were beginning to lose hope. They were hungry. They thought of another siege ten years before in another French town. It had lasted a full year. The people of that city had been forced to eat cats, horses, and rats to survive. Eventually that city had surrendered. The people of Orl�ans didn&#x2019;t want to surrender, but what else could they do? &#x201c;We need a miracle,&#x201d; they said to one another.<br> &nbsp;<br> And maybe a miracle was coming! People who managed to sneak inside the gate of Orl�ans brought news of a very special peasant girl. She saw visions. She spoke to angels and saints. Her name was Joan of Arc. On April 29, 1429, the citizens of Orl�ans heard amazing news. Joan had arrived! She had slipped through an unguarded gate in the wall and entered the town. And she wasn&#x2019;t alone. She brought men who wanted to help, and wagonloads of food and farm animals. Hundreds of people ran to see her.<br> &nbsp;<br> What they saw was a seventeen-year-old girl who wore her hair cut short and dressed like a boy. She wore a suit of armor specially made to fit her small frame. She carried a sword and a banner with angels on it. The banner read &#x201c;Jhesus Maria&#x201d; for Jesus and Mary. She was on a mission to save the town of Orl�ans.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the people of Orl�ans looked at Joan, they saw an unlikely hero who they believed had been sent by God. With her sword at her side and her banner raised high, Joan was a living symbol of hope for the people of Orl�ans&#x2014;and for all of France.</p><h2>Home Cooking for Your Dog: 75 Holistic Recipes for a Healthier Dog</h2><p><i>Home Cooking for Your Dog </i>is the first holistic cookbook for dogs to include recipes for cooked meals, treats, <i>and </i>the raw food diet&#x2015;a big trend in the pet industry.

Silas hoards a treasure that kills his spirit until fate steals it from him and replaces it with a golden-haired founding child. Where she came from, who her parents were, and who really stole the gold are the secrets that permeate this moving tale of guilt and innocence. A moral allegory of the redemptive power of love, it is also a finely drawn picture of early nineteenth-century England in the days when spinning wheels hummed busily in the farmhouses, and of a simple way of life that was soon to disappear.<p></p><p>"I think <i>Silas Marner</i> holds a higher place than any of the author's works.
